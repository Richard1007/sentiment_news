Sources close to the comic said he died Sunday at the Ritz-Carlton in Orlando, Florida, and police confirmed his death shortly afterward. Employees of the hotel found Saget, who had recently started a tour of the US, in his room around 4 p.m., and Sheriff's deputies and the fire department arrived soon after. Few details are currently available about the circumstances leading up to Saget's death, though sources said he was pronounced dead in his hotel room. The Orange County Sheriff's Office told TMZ[https://www.tmz.com/2022/01/09/bob-saget-dead-dies-hotel-comedian-full-house/] that it has 'no information on cause of death, and detectives have found no signs of foul play or drug use in this case.' A day before his death, Saget posted on upbeat tweet and Instagram following a set in Jacksonville, Florida, on Saturday in which he wrote that performing felt as fresh as 'when I was 26' and said he 'finding my new voice and loving every moment of it', ending the message with 'peace out'. Tributes rushed in for the comedy star with Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who took turns playing his youngest daughter on Full House, describing Saget as 'the most loving, compassionate and generous man.' They said: 'We are deeply saddened that he is no longer with us but know that he will continue to be by our side to guide us as gracefully as he always has. We are thinking of his daughters, wife and family and are sending our condolences.' Saget's Full House costar John Stamos wrote that he was 'broken' and 'gutted' after hearing the news. 'I am in complete and utter shock. I will never ever have another friend like him. I love you so much Bobby,' he lamented on Twitter. The star is survived by his wife Kelly Rizzo, whom he married in 2018, and his three children ï¿½?Aubrey, 34; Lara, 32; and Jennifer, 29 ï¿½?all of whom he shared with his first wife Sherri Kramer, whom he was married to from 1982 to 1997.

'On arrival, they located a man who was unresponsive in a hotel room. The man, identified as Robert Lane Saget, was pronounced deceased on scene. We have no information on cause of death, and detectives have found no signs of foul play or drug use in this case.' The cause of death is yet to be determined and police 'do not anticipate' that further information will be given at this time. The statement continued: 'This is all the information we have for release at this time and we do not anticipate further updates. The Medical Examiner's Office will ultimately determine cause and manner of death.' The comedian's unexpected death comes amid his cross-country stand-up tour, which kicked off back in September 2021. He had recently played a string of dates in Florida, including a show in Orlando. On Saturday, the night before his body was discovered, Saget sent his final tweet following a show at Jacksonville, Florida's Ponte Vedra Concert Hall. 'Loved tonight's show @PV_ConcertHall in Jacksonville. Appreciative audience,' he wrote. 'Thanks again to @RealTimWilkins for opening. I had no idea I did a 2 hr set tonight. I'm happily addicted again to this s***. Check BobSaget.com for my dates in 2022.' The comedy icon began his career as a stand-up in his hometown of Philadelphia, before heading west to Los Angeles. He went on to have a string of small parts in films starting in the late 1970s, but it wasn't until a decade later that he became a household name. Although he developed a reputation among his fellow stand-up comedians for his profane comedy sets, Saget paradoxically had his greatest success with the heartwarming sitcom Full House. He starred on the ABC series as Danny Tanner from 1987 through 1995, and then led the Netflix sequel series Fuller House for five seasons from 2016 to 2020. In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper from July 2021, Saget revealed that he never expected to lean into cleaner comedy shows like Full House. 'Full House was an accident,' he said. 'I got fired on CBS and was asked to be in Full House.' Saget played a widowed sports anchor who moves in with his late wife's brother Jesse (John Stamos) and his childhood friend Joey (Dave Coulier) as they help him raise his three daughters, played by Candace Cameron, Jodie Sweetin and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who split the role of Michelle Tanner. 'My heart is broken,' said Dave Coulier, who played a comedian on Full House. 'I love you, Bob. Your forever brother, Dave.' Andrea Barber, who played Kimmy Gibbler on Full House and its sequel series, shared a sweet still from Fuller House of herself hugging Saget to mark his death. 'This one hurts,' she began her lengthy caption. 'He had the biggest heart of anyone in Hollywood. He gave the biggest hugs. I am gutted that I will never be able to hug him again. 'Bob ended every text, every interaction with 'Love you.' Didn't matter how long or short we'd been apart. He loved so deeply and so fiercely,' she continued. 'And he never hesitated to tell you just how much you meant to him. This is the greatest lesson I learned from Bob Saget ï¿½?don't hesitate to tell people you love them. I feel at peace knowing that Bob knew exactly how much I adore him.' She concluded: 'Rest well, my dear friend. I have no doubt you are making everyone in Heaven laugh until their cheeks hurt, just as you did here on Earth â¤ï¸.' Candace Cameron Bure, who played the actor's daughter D.J. Tanner on Full House, was left speechless after learning of his death. 'I don't know what to say [broken-hearted emoji]. I have no words,' she tweeted. 'Bob was one of the best human beings I've ever known in my life. I loved him so much.' The comedian played up his family-friendly bona fides by concurrently starring on America's Funniest Home Videos from 1989 through 1997. He hosted the series, which collected humorous home videos sent in by fans, and also provided voiceovers for the clips to ramp up the comedy. Although he didn't appear in front of the camera, Saget's recognizable voice narrated another ABC sitcom, How I Met Your Mother, in which he played an older version of Ted Mosby (played on-screen by Josh Radnor). Radnor eulogized his colleague in a Twitter thread, culminating with a smiley photo of the two. Like so many others, he described his friend as 'the kindest, loveliest, funniest, most supportive man' and a 'mensch among mensches.' The actor and comedian poked fun at his image with a recurring role on HBO's Entourage, and he also led the single-season WB sitcom Raising Dad, which featured rising stars Kat Dennings and Brie Larson with Sopranos fixture Jerry Adler. Dennings expressed her sorrow at news of her former costars death on Sunday. 'Oh god. Bob Saget!!! The loveliest man. I was his TV daughter for one season and he was always so kind and protective. So so sorry for his family,' she tweeted. Saget wasn't afraid to get a bit silly, and one of his recent appearances was as a disguised figure on The Masked Singer. He focused more on his preferred brand of comedy in recent years with his podcast Bob Saget's Here For You, which he began recording in 2020. Other small but impactful roles include an uncredited part as a cocaine addict in Dave Chappelle's 1998 stoner comedy Half Baked, and he was one of the many comedians featured in the documentary The Aristocrats, about the infamous foul comedy routine of the title. When he wasn't on stage or in front of the camera, Saget also tried his hand at directing. He helmed the Norm Macdonaldâstarring comedy Dirty Work, which was reviled by critics but later reevaluated as a cult classic, and he provided voices for and directed the straight-to-video parody film Farce Of The Penguins. Last year, Rizzo revealed on Instagram that the couple had spent their first Christmas together, despite having been married multiple years. 'So happy to spend my very first Christmas with @BobSaget (even though we've been married over 3 years!) because he's finally in Chicago for the holidays!' she captioned a cute photo of the couple holding hands in front of a Chinese dragon statue. Shortly before his death, Saget mused about the nature of the afterlife while paying tribute to Betty White after she died just days away from her 100th birthday. 'I don't know what happens when we die, but if Betty says you get to be with the love of your life, then I happily defer to Betty on this,' he wrote, noting the actress' undying love for her late husband Allen Ludden, who died in 1981. Saget managed to be an unending source of humor for his fans despite several family tragedies earlier in life. His sister Andrea died of a brain aneurysm in 1985, and his other sister Gay died from the autoimmune disease scleroderma in 1994. In a 2019 interview with NIH Medline Plus Magazine[https://magazine-medlineplus-gov.proxy.library.nyu.edu/article/dont-give-up-hope], Saget revealed he had been working with the Scleroderma Research Foundation even prior to his sister's diagnosis. The disease leads to hardening of the skin and connective tissue, and the TV star described it as 'incredibly painful,' adding that his family was 'still having post-traumatic stress disorder' from caring for his sister in her final days. His experience with the disease later inspired him to direct the TV Movie For Hope, which starred Dana Delany as a woman diagnosed with the same illness that killed his sister. Following news of Saget's death, tributes began flowing in from his famous friends and admirers, most of whom noted Saget's warmth and kindness. Although SNL star Pete Davidson doesn't have his own social media accounts, he had a friend share a statement online in which he revealed that Saget had had played an essential role in helping him with mental health issues. 'Bob Saget was one of the nicest men on the planet,' he began. 'When I was younger and several times throughout our friendship he helped me get through some rough mental health stuff. He stayed on the phone with my mom for hours trying to help in anyway he can ï¿½?connecting us with doctors and new things we can try,' he continued. 'He would check in on me and make sure I was okay. 'I love you Bob it was an honor to know you. Thank you for your kindness and friendship. My condolences to the family.' Jim Carrey memorialized the late comedian with a black-and-white photo of the two in their early years. He called Saget 'beautiful' and added, 'He had a big, big heart and a wonderfully warped comic mind. He gave the world a lot of joy and lived his life for goodness' sake.' Adam Sandler called Saget a 'great man' and 'funny as hell,' adding, 'Such a nice person. Love to Bob and his whole family.' The Office star B.J. Novak, who had appeared on Bob Saget's Here For You earlier in January, reacted to the news with a simple broken-hearted emoji. On January 3, he had retweeted a clip from his episode and serenaded the late comic: 'I have always and will always love Bob Saget.'

187,1,"LIC IPO: Centre Wooing Sovereign, Pension Funds Tata Sons Recasts Air India Board",522 words,The Economic Times - Mumbai Edition,"The funds had shown interest and the government wants to confirm their participation, said officials involved in the offer. ET had reported earlier this week that the IPO is likely to be held toward the end of this month. ""Many leading sovereign funds have expressed interest in the LIC IPO. Merchant bankers are in advanced discussions with them for being anchor investors in the issue,"" one of the officials told ET. The government is keen on their participation as these funds are stable investors with a long-term horizon, the person said. The government had reached out to about 180 potential anchor investors during roadshows. Officials feel at least 8-10 big-ticket foreign investors will be required as anchor investors for the IPO, set to be the biggest ever Indian public offer. In December last year, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had extended the lock-in period for anchor investors to 90 days from 30 days earlier. The market regulator also removed restrictions on the maximum number of anchor investors for public issues in excess of `250 crore. At an estimated embedded value of `5.4 lakh crore, the Centre may raise `60,000-70,000 crore through the 5% stake sale in LIC. The anchor investment portion is expected to be around `18,000 crore. Tata Sons has recast the board of Air India, moving the airline's executives who held board positions to senior management roles. It has also appointed a chief commercial officer, and heads of human resources, digital and technology, customer experience and ground handling at the airline.  Anirban Chowdhury reports. According to the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) filed with Sebi, the insurer will allocate 60% of the qualified institutional buyers' (QIBs) portion to anchor inv estors on a discretionary basis. Strong anchor inv estments giv e confidence to retail and other institutional inv estors, helping genera te demand for IPO when it opens to the general public. The official said that while the discussions were going on, there is still no f irm commitment on the quantum of the inv estment they were likely to make. ""That will happen when we zero in on the final issue price and when it is communicated to them. The process is on and we will do it soon,"" the official said, without giving a t imeline. One key consideration is the listing price and the market capitalisation at that level. Anything below `10.7 lakh crore valuation at listing can make inclusion in the MSCI inde x difficult, said the official. The government has budgeted `65,000 crore from disinvestment in the current financial year."
579,1,"U.S. Department of Labor - Ocean County landscaping company ordered to pay $220K in back wages, civil penalties after federal investigation, administrative law judge decision, order",737 words,U.S. Government News and Documents via PUBT,"BAYVILLE, NJ - Following a U.S. Department of Labor investigation, an administrative law judge ordered a commercial landscaping company based in Bayville to pay 47 temporary landscaping workers $181,670.19 in back wages. The employer will also pay $38,329.81 in civil money penalties. The department's Wage and Hour Division[https://www-dol-gov.proxy.library.nyu.edu/agencies/whd] investigation determined that Turf Masters Inc. employed grasscutters for more than 50 hours per week, paid them sub-prevailing wage rates for all hours worked, and then attempted to hide these practices from the division. Turf Masters hired the workers from Mexico to work as grasscutters under the H-2B temporary non-agricultural workers visa program[https://www-dol-gov.proxy.library.nyu.edu/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/h-2b], which allows employers to temporarily hire foreign workers to perform nonagricultural labor or services in the United States. Specifically, the division found Turf Masters violated the H-2B program requirements to: * Pay the required prevailing wage rate, at the time, of $15.52 per hour and $23.28 for overtime hours worked. The employer instead paid the temporary workers approximately $11 an hour; * Reimburse workers for inbound and outbound travel expenses; and * Comply with retaining records and documents for three years from the date the H-2B application is certified, or from the date of adjudication if the application is denied, or from the day the department receives the letter of withdrawal if the employer withdraws the application. Investigators also determined that Turf Masters instructed workers to, among other things, falsely state that they never worked overtime hours. The department's Office of Administrative Law Judges issued a decision and order approving consent findings, which requires Turf Masters to pay back wages to resolve the wage violations. The landscaping company will also pay the civil money penalty assessed by the department due to the substantial nature of the violations. Additionally, the employer agreed to extensive enhanced compliance measures for the next four years that require the institution of an electronic timekeeping system; hiring of a bilingual monitor to conduct trainings, audits, and confidential interviews of all the company's H-2B workers every year and installation of GPS devices on each vehicle used to transport workers. ""Employees have a right to be paid their wages, to seek those wages and cooperate with investigators. The Wage and Hour Division will not tolerate interference with its investigations,"" said Wage and Hour Division District Director Charlene Rachor in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. ""This investigation underscores the department's commitment to using all enforcement tools to protect the rights of people who work in the U.S. Other employers should use the outcome of this investigation as an opportunity to review their own practices to make sure they comply with the law and avoid violations like those found in this case."" ""Employers who flout the rules of the H-2B program harm workers and gain unfair economic advantages. The U.S. Department of Labor will actively litigate such cases to achieve resolutions that ensure that applicants and workers are properly paid and prevent future violations,"" said regional Solicitor of Labor Jeffrey Rogoff in New York. The division's Southern New Jersey District Office conducted the investigation. Attorney Jacob Heyman-Kantor and Senior Trial Attorney Rolando Valdez with the department's regional Office of the Solicitor in New York litigated the case.

338,1,Workers securing big pay hikes amid worldwide skills shortage,552 words,The Herald,"Paul Venables, the groupâs finance director, said that employees switching jobs for promotion are getting pay rises of close to 20%, with those in highly sought after technology roles able to boost their wages by a quarter. He said there is a shortage of skills worldwide as firms embark on a hiring spree across economies emerging from the pandemic. Technology specialists are among the most in demand due to a push for digital transformations across corporates worldwide, according to Hays. Mr Venables said it was âabsolutely the strongestï¿½?market he has seen during his time at the group and likely for decades. âItâs the highest permanent recruitment market in my 16 years with Hays and the highest wage inflation Iâve seen,ï¿½?he said.  Hays hailed a record performance at the start of 2022 due to the hot jobs market, but revealed a hit of around Â£5 million after pulling out of Russia. The group posted a 32% surge in like-for-like fees over its third quarter to the end of March, with record-breaking results across 19 countries and its highest ever monthly fees in March. Fees in the UK and Ireland rose 29%, it added. Hays said the closure early last month of its offices in Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine will result in about Â£5 million in one-off costs. The sites in Moscow and St Petersburg ï¿½?which employed 245 staff ï¿½?accounted in half-year results for around Â£5.9 million in group fees and about 1% or Â£800,000 of company earnings. Full-year guidance remains for operating profits of Â£210 million to Â£215 million, excluding the Russia hit.  Alistair Cox, chief executive of Hays, said: âWhile we are mindful of increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, client and candidate confidence remains strong, with continued skill shortages and rising wage inflation globally.ï¿½?The group said it had boosted its consultancy workforce by 4% since the end of last year ï¿½?up 27% year-on-year ï¿½?and expects to add up to another 3% in its final quarter as it beefs up operations to match a buoyant jobs market. Official figures earlier this week confirmed the jobs market in the UK remains solid, with the rate of unemployment falling further below pre-pandemic levels, to 3.8% ï¿½?the lowest since December 2019. But there were signs of easing demand for staff, with the smallest monthly increase in UK pay-rolled workers since February last year, with vacancy growth also slowing. Mr Venables said in the white collar sector he was ânot seeing any signs of things cooling offï¿½?yet. Hays said the UK and Ireland region ï¿½?which accounts for 22% of group net fees ï¿½?saw third-quarter performance led by permanent jobs recruitment up 59% while temporary hiring fees rose 13%. The North West and the South East had stand-out fee growth of 49% and 41% respectively, while Ireland enjoyed a 61% surge. London ï¿½?its largest region ï¿½?increased by 28%, including London City, up 57%."

Meanwhile, the BBC took a step in the opposite direction, saying Tuesday it would resume reporting from Russia after a four-day hiatus. The BBC was one of several media organizations that announced Friday they would cease reporting and broadcasting from the country, or in the country, but no others have yet said they will remove all editorial personnel. Bloomberg News editor in chief John Micklethwait said the global news organization would ""temporarily suspend our newsgathering inside Russia,"" arguing that the changed criminal code ""makes it impossible to continue any semblance of normal journalism inside the country."" He said that Bloomberg News ""will obviously continue to support our staff in the country, even if for now they can no longer do their jobs there."" (The news organization has 27 reporters, editors and translators based in Russia.) Major American television news networks have largely stopped broadcasting from the country, and CNN said on Friday that its programming would not be visible in the country, so as to protect the network and its employees - though the network did not announce plans to evacuate personnel from the country. A spokesperson for ABC News said on Friday that the network ""will continue to assess the situation and determine what this means for the safety of our teams on the ground,"" beyond deciding not to broadcast from the country. A Post spokeswoman, Shani George, said on Saturday that the newspaper is ""continuing to seek clarity about whether Russia's new restrictions will apply to international news organizations,"" although in the meantime it is removing bylines and datelines from specific stories as a means of protecting Russia-based contributors. ""We want to be sure that our Moscow-based correspondents are not held responsible for material that is produced from beyond Russia,"" she added. Independent media outlets in Russia have also been crushed by Russian President Vladimir Putin's crackdown, with many reporters fleeing the country. The Committee to Protect Journalists has implored Russian officials to allow local and international media outlets to operate freely. ""The Russian public cannot be deprived of information and news and be forced to rely on the Kremlin-approved interpretation of events at this very important time in Russian history,"" Gulnoza Said, the committee's Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, said in a statement late last week. ""The censorship must stop, and bans must be lifted."" The BBC issued a statement Tuesday saying that it would resume broadcasting from Russia again later in the day. ""We will tell this crucial part of the story independently and impartially, adhering to the BBC's strict editorial standards,"" the statement said. ""The safety of our staff in Russia remains our number one priority."""
931,1,Worldwide semiconductor revenue grew 26% in 2021: Report,311 words,Indo-Asian News Service,"""The events behind the current chip shortage continue to impact original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) around the world, but the 5G smartphone ramps up and a combination of strong demand and logistics/raw material price increases drove semiconductor average selling prices (ASPs) higher, contributing to significant revenue growth in 2021,"" Andrew Norwood, Vice President, Research, at Gartner, said in a statement.  Intel's revenue declined 0.3 per cent, garnering 12.2 per cent market share compared to a 12.3 per cent market share for Samsung. Within the top 10, AMD and Mediatek experienced the strongest growth in 2021 at 68.6 per cent and 60.2 per cent growth, respectively. The most significant shift among the semiconductor vendor ranking in 2021 was HiSilicon dropping out of the top 25. ""HiSilicon's revenue declined 81 per cent, from $8.2 billion in 2020 to $1.5 billion in 2021,"" said Norwood. ""This was a direct result of the US sanctions against the company and its parent company Huawei,"" Norwood added. According to Norwood, this also impacted China's share of the semiconductor market as it declined from 6.7 per cent market share in 2020 to 6.5 per cent in 2021. ""South Korea had the largest increase in market share in 2021 as strong growth in the memory market propelled South Korea to garner 19.3 per cent of the global semiconductor market,"" Norwood said. --IANS vc/vd"
233,0,"SOK closes Prismat and hotels in St. Petersburg, no plans to return to Russia*** TRANSLATED ***",385 words,STT,"According to Annala, business in St. Petersburg became challenging first with the corona pandemic and then with the war. The S Group emphasizes in its press release that it strongly condemns the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The company has already announced this week that it will remove products of Russian origin from the selections of its stores. SOK has 16 Prisma and three Sokos Hotels in St. Petersburg. There are a total of about a thousand employees. According to Annala, the exact schedule for the closure of both Prisms and the hotel is currently being determined, but the shutdown has already begun. - The aim is to sell Prisma's products on a fast schedule, Annala told STT by e-mail on Friday. According to Annala, the sanctions imposed on Russia by Western countries have, in practice, led to significant difficulties in payment transactions both within Russia and between Russia and Finland. The operation of shopping centers partly owned by SRV will continue Construction company SRV has acted as a sub-investor in three shopping centers in Russia. The company says in its press release that shopping center operations in Russia will continue for the time being. - Our goal has been to gradually reduce operations in the Russian market by selling our stake in shopping centers, the press release says. The company says it is exploring opportunities to accelerate secession from Russia. According to the company, recent sanctions are also expected to affect the shopping center business. SRV's net sales in Russia last year were almost EUR 7 million. It consisted mainly of revenue from the operation of shopping centers and revenue from the sale of one project. In total, SRV's turnover last year was more than EUR 930 million. The company says it has outlined that it will completely stop sourcing building materials from Russia. *** DISCLAIMER: THIS IS AN AUTOMATED TRANSLATION FROM FINNISH ***"
456,1,Excelerate raises $384M in IPO underscoring investors' confidence in LNG,701 words,SNL Daily Gas Report,"The company operates a fleet of floating storage regasification units, or FSRUs, which can be an attractive option for countries looking to ramp LNG imports in the near term. The offshore vessels typically can be developed faster than permanent import terminals, and FSRUs can be used temporarily before moving on to other markets. ""This war in Ukraine is certainly the most disruptive energy event in two generations,"" Steven Kobos, Excelerate's president and CEO, said in an interview. ""People are still working through that. Because of the desire for energy security, that pressure coming out of Europe is likely to force quicker decision-making even outside of Europe because everybody understands there is an asset class in the near term that can allow quick ability to flex up your LNG imports."" 'Investment deficit' in LNG Excelerate's 10 FSRUs represent more than a fifth of the world's global fleet. The import facilities can be sizeable; Kobos said Excelerate's FSRU in Karachi, Pakistan, delivers 4.5 million tonnes per year of LNG, or more than 1% of global production. The company's listing on the New York Stock Exchange marked the biggest IPO since January. It showed a significant shift in sentiment since Vine Energy Inc. in March 2021 became the first U.S. oil and gas company to pursue an IPO in years, only to get a chilly reception from Wall Street. Share prices of publicly traded U.S. LNG developers have also surged since the invasion, including the stock of Excelerate competitor New Fortress Energy Inc. On April 12, Excelerate sold 16 million shares for $24 each, at the high end of the company's target range. Shares were at $27.36 in afternoon trading April 13, about 14% above the offering price. Excelerate planned to use the proceeds of its IPO, valuing the company at about $2.5 billion, to fund new projects that address what Kobos described as an ""investment deficit"" in downstream LNG infrastructure. ""This isn't a liquidity event,"" Kobos said. ""This is all about fueling capital for growth projects."" Selling gas into Europe The company, founded in 2003 by oil and gas billionaire George Kaiser, has focused on developing LNG infrastructure to serve emerging markets, where gas can replace dirtier burning coal and support economic growth. Besides the U.S. and Pakistan, Excelerate operates in Brazil, Argentina, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bangladesh. Kobos said Excelerate is also working on an LNG import project in Albania that could supply more gas to Europe and said the company would continue to look for ""opportunistic plays"" in other European countries. Europe has spare LNG import capacity but not where it is needed to offset Russian gas supplies. The majority of spare capacity, 42.5 billion cubic meters per year, is on the Iberian Peninsula, which can only export 8 Bcm per year eastward to the continent, according to analysts at S&P Global Commodity Insights. In recent weeks, EU member states such as Germany have announced plans to secure new LNG import infrastructure to help reduce European dependence on Russian gas supplies. ""We have been thinking about how to integrate floating terminals as a means of selling gas into Europe for some time,"" Kobos said.

Ms Haugen's evidence came just hours after the share price of Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, tumbled as much as 24 per cent after the number of new users stalled and it forecast slower growth in advertising revenue. Ms Haugen shot to global attention last year when, as a former company insider, she leaked documents and gave damning testimony to a US congressional committee. She said the company knew the algorithms underpinning products on Facebook and Instagram were sowing misinformation and harming children[https://www.afr.com/technology/facebook-s-disconnection-problem-20211005-p58xbd], but executives had put ""astronomical profits"" ahead of safety. She was invited by the Morrison government to give evidence to its inquiry into social media giants and the ""toxic material""[https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/pm-launches-fresh-assault-on-toxic-tech-giants-20211130-p59djp] they allow to be published and distributed online. âSelf-regulation does not work' Ms Haugen, a data scientist, commended Australia for taking on big tech, including introducing the news bargaining code to support public interest journalism. But she urged the government to go further, as British and European officials have done, and attempt to regulate ""the heart of the business model of the platforms"" - the algorithms and design features that allow disinformation and hate to be spread and exploitation of personal data. ""In every part of the world, what has become clear over the last few years is self-regulation does not work. Platforms cannot be trusted to act in the public interest,"" she said. ""Australia is due to have a federal election in only a few months. As we have seen in many recent elections around the world, particularly in the United States, threats to electoral integrity are unpredictable and can escalate rapidly. ""Australia with its unique geopolitical position is no exception. Social media is a major vector for co-ordinated disinformation campaigns. It adds fuel to the fire of confusion and fake news. It amplifies the most sensationalistic content to the detriment of balance and facts. ""China is a very, very sophisticated operator who has invested tremendously in weaponising social media platforms in open societies because they view our strengths as our weaknesses."" Ms Haugen said societies could no longer rely on platforms to moderate harmful and illegal content downstream given the sheer volume of material produced, and Facebook often ""blamed the victim"" when criticised. She said many things could be done to make platforms safer for children and reduce the spread of dangerous content and disinformation. She said social media companies should be made to do an assessment of the risks their products posed and make it public, while regulators, parents, doctors and others in the community should do likewise, so they could be held accountable. Academics also should be given safe harbour to analyse Facebook's data, she said, noting the company had threatened to sue US academics and suspended their accounts after they attempted to examine how Facebook advertisements manipulated US elections. One policy change that could be made was requiring the appointment of human moderators to approve the posting of content for groups that have more than 10,000 members."
259,1,CUNY Career Launch recruits students without paid internship experience,640 words,U-Wire,"News CUNY Career Launch recruits students without paid internship experience Jo Ramos Mia Gindis, 2024 April 15, 2022  CUNY launched a new program targeting undergraduate students who lack a substantial paid internship experience in their intended career field. This summer, 2,000 CUNY students will be selected to participate in CUNY Career Launch and intern in a field related to their major. The deadline to apply is April 29. âDid you know that 82% of CUNY graduates stay in NYC after graduation?ï¿½?the programâs webpage said. âBy working in one of the Cityâs key industries and networking with employers, you will get a jumpstart on your post-graduation career.ï¿½?CUNY Career Launch will reportedly cater to ambitious undergraduate students who are prepared to utilize the skills theyâve accumulated in the classroom for a job. The program was created in response to a growing demand from CUNY students for more paid work-based learning opportunities. On average, only about 12% of CUNY students reported completing a paid internship prior to graduation, according to the 2019-2020 Performance Management Process data book. One report from NYCâs Disconnected Youth Task Force reveals that low-income post-graduates âmay not have the benefit of connections to employersï¿½?and are âless likely to have regular exposure to careers they may want to pursue.ï¿½?The aim of CUNY Career Launch is to remedy this issue by democratizing entry into the postgraduation labor market through paid work-based learning opportunities, according to Arlys Tineo, an administrative assistant for the program. âWe know that a good portion of CUNY students are low income - 2 out of 3 students attend tuition-free - and according to the Mayorâs Management Report, over half report an annual income of less than $30,000,ï¿½?Tineo said in an email statement. âThe CUNY Career Launch model directly confronts this issue.ï¿½?Positions are available in a wide range of fields, including computer science, engineering, healthcare, education, public affairs, political science, environmental science, community or social services. âAs a CUNY Career Launch intern, you will have the opportunity to build skills, extend your professional network, add to your resume, and support employers throughout NYC in several key industries,ï¿½?the application page said. Participating students will be paid $20 an hour, just five dollars more than New Yorkâs minimum wage. They will have an earning potential of approximately $2,600 for the entire summer. The program plans to offer a mix of in-person, hybrid and work-from-home roles. However, the latter will be reserved for individuals with health issues that prevent them from working in person. Willingness to accept an in-person or hybrid position increases a studentâs chances of being matched with a Career Launch internship. Preference will be granted to students with no prior paid internship experience. Required practicums for healthcare, social work and education students will not count as internships, according to the Career Launch webpage. The program takes place for a duration of seven weeks between early July and mid-August for 19 hours a week. âYou can take a summer class, keep your part-time job, or take care of family while you intern with CUNY Career Launch,ï¿½?the page said. The program is being organized by the CUNY Office of Continuing Education and Workforce Programs. To qualify, students must be between the ages of 18 and 24 and enrolled in CUNY courses at the time of application. Students must also be eligible to work in the United States. There will be voluntary information sessions in April for students to ask questions about the program. For any inquiries, students should contact careerlaunch@cuny.edu.

996,0,Ex-TM Lewin staff win fight for payout over job losses,287 words,The Daily Telegraph,"A total of 101 former workers are now set to receive a combined payout after an employment tribunal ruled in their favour. Staff members will be able to access funds of up to Â£4,352 as part of a total of up to Â£439,000 via the Government's insolvency service. The retailer was bought by Torque Brands in May 2020 from Bain, the private equity firm. A month later it went into administration and the assets were bought back by Torque through a pre-pack deal - but not the high street shops, putting 600 jobs at risk. At the time some staff criticised the redundancy process after they were let go on two conference calls. Anita North at law firm Simpson Millar, who represented the staff, said: ""The initial collapse had a devastating impact on its employees, especially in the height of the pandemic in 2020. This judgment brings to a close a difficult period for those affected."" Representatives for Torque were contacted for comment. An employment tribunal can grant a so-called protective award of compensation worth up to 90 days' gross pay. The news comes after TM Lewin was rescued from administration by its lenders this month. It went bust for the second time in March. The new owners are expected to relaunch the online website over the coming weeks and are considering the possibility of opening new high street stores."

714,1,Elon Musk Offers to Buy Rest of Twitter for $54.20 a Share -- 5th Update,1231 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"Twitter confirmed it had received Mr. Musk's offer and said its board of directors would review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company and all its shareholders. The bid adds to a whirlwind 10 days for Twitter and increases the stakes for the company and Chief Executive Parag Agrawal. On Thursday, Mr. Musk reiterated Twitter's potential to be the platform for free speech, saying the company ""will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form."" ""Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company,"" Mr. Musk said in a filing Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it."" According to the filing, Mr. Musk texted Twitter Chairman Bret Taylor that he was sending an offer letter and would make it public in the morning. He ended the text stream with, ""Are you available to chat?"" Mr. Musk, with more than 80 million followers on Twitter, has long been one of the platform's most prominent users and, at times, one of its most vocal critics. A self-described ""free speech absolutist,"" Mr. Musk has publicly encouraged the platform to allow a wide range of opinions. ""I am not playing the back-and-forth game,"" Mr. Musk said in what was described in the filing as a voice script. ""I have moved straight to the end."" Mr. Musk said he would pay $54.20 a share in cash, representing what he said was a 54% premium over the day before he began investing in Twitter and a 38% premium over the day before his investment was announced. ""It's a high price, and your shareholders will love it,"" he said. Mr. Musk added that Twitter could call his family office with any questions about the offer. The filing said Mr. Musk had hired Morgan Stanley as a financial adviser.  Twitter shares closed Wednesday at $45.85. In morning trading Thursday, the stock rose 2.4% to $46.90. Over the past year, Twitter's shares have traded between $31.30 and $73.34. Given how the stock is trading, ""the market is pricing in a higher likelihood that the deal is rejected than accepted,"" said Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor. Mr. Musk said Thursday that he would consider selling his stake if the deal doesn't work out, ""given that I don't have confidence in management nor do I believe I can drive the necessary change in the public market."" Mr. Musk began buying Twitter shares on Jan. 31, when the stock traded at $36.83, according to a filing earlier this month. Those purchases continued through April 1. Mr. Musk's stake in the company was made public April 4, and plans for him to join the board were announced April 5. He then spent much of this past weekend tweeting criticisms, suggestions and apparent jokes about the company -- before deciding not to join the board earlier this week. The tweets, taken together, targeted the core of Twitter's business, seemingly suggesting the company shut down its headquarters and cut staff while shifting from an ad-based business to one that depends more upon subscriptions. ""The power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if Twitter depends on advertising money to survive,"" Mr. Musk said in a tweet that was later deleted. On Thursday, Mr. Musk added to those comments: ""As I indicated this weekend, I believe that the company should be private to go through the changes that need to be made,"" he said in the filing. Analysts have suggested that one of Mr. Musk's motivations could be to influence Twitter's moderation policies, which he has criticized as being too restrictive. The Tesla Inc. chief executive is scheduled to appear Thursday at a TED conference in Vancouver. Separately, he tweeted Thursday, ""I made an offer."" Mr. Musk's bid comes as Twitter seeks to add more users and boost revenue. The company said a little over a year ago that it would work to at least double its revenue to $7.5 billion by the end of 2023, and reach at least 315 million so-called monetizable daily active users at that time. The company recorded $5.08 billion in revenue in 2021, up 37% from the previous year. Daily users increased 13% to about 217 million. If the company maintains this pace through the end of 2023, it would exceed its revenue target, but miss the mark for enlarging its user base. Over the past two years, Twitter has experimented with new features and products intended to fuel user engagement and more revenue, with mixed results. The company -- less than a year after launching it -- shut down Fleets, a feature that allowed users to post full-screen photos and videos that disappeared after a day, similar to the stories features available on rival services Instagram and Snapchat.  Twitter had more success with a feature it began testing in December 2020 called Spaces, which let users congregate in audio-only rooms. The feature was successful enough in testing to be launched a few months later to Twitter users with more than 600 followers. The company followed that with Twitter Blue, a paid version that offers subscribers exclusive features. Among the features included in the $2.99 monthly service is the ability for subscribers to use nonfungible tokens they own as their Twitter profile pictures. In the weekend tweets, Mr. Musk said Twitter Blue should ban ads, lower its $2.99-a-month price and consider accepting the cryptocurrency dogecoin as payment for the subscription service. He also said subscribers should get an authentication check mark. Some analysts said Mr. Musk could influence Twitter to ease up on content moderation or reinstate banned users, such as Donald Trump. The company banned the account of the then-president in January 2021, citing what it said was a risk of incitement to violence. That move drew sharp criticism from Mr. Trump and some of his supporters. Such changes could spur user growth and engagement if more users come onto the service and more debates are sparked, but it could also scare away advertisers, analysts have said. In March, Mr. Musk polled his followers on Twitter for their thoughts on whether the social network adheres to free-speech principles. In the poll, 70% of the more than 2 million respondents voted no. Mr. Musk also said at that time that he would give serious thought to building a new platform. --Colin Kellaher contributed to this article.

Private placement still made up an outstanding proportion of over 80%, equivalent to some VND22.18 trillion, a surge of 51%. Meanwhile, public offerings amounted to nearly VND5.51 trillion, up 31% year-on-year, according to data from the Vietnam Bond Market Association. Realty firms replaced banks as leading debt issuers with a total of VND15.52 trillion, accounting for more than 56%, concentrated on the short terms of 1-3 years, worth around VND9.31 trillion. Since banks have not stepped up their bond sales yet in the year to date, the group of construction firms ranked second with VND7.93 trillion worth of corporate debt sold, making up 28.6%. The positive growth of the corporate debt market right in the first two months of the year partly reinforces the forecast of organizations, when the majority of them believe this investment channel will further develop this year with expansion in both the size and diversity of products. This is especially true as the economyâs long-term growth potential entails the need for capital within the corporate sector to give their business and investment activities a boost. Although the volume of corporate bonds registered an average growth rate of 46% per year in the period from 2017 to 2021, reaching approximately VND1,390 trillion by the end of last year, thereby sharply increasing the market size from 4.93% of GDP in 2017 to 16.6% in late 2021, this figure remains quite modest when compared to regional economies such as China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Singapore or Thailand. Therefore, the potential and room for future development are huge. The fact that bank deposits and government bonds are offering meagre interest rates may further stimulate the need to find alternative investment channels among both institutional and individual investors, with corporate bonds as one of their favorites in recent years. In addition, Circular 57/2021/TT-BTC came into force on July 20, 2021, with a roadmap to rearrange the market of securities, according to which operations and transactions in the secondary corporate bond market will be carried out in a centralized manner on the Hanoi Stock Exchange this year, helping improve the liquidity of this investment channel. According to Decree 155 on the sale of bonds to the public, from January 1, 2023, onward, the bonds specified in Clause 2, Article 19, must be rated by a credit rating agency with a business eligibility certificate granted by the Ministry of Finance. Currently, there are only two entities with such a certificate, namely Saigon Phat Thinh Credit Rating JSC and Fiin Rating (under Fiin Group). For this reason, businesses are more motivated to accelerate their bond issuance this year before they can be rated if they look to sell more from the beginning of next year. Challenges ahead However, in the context that the global economy, especially Vietnam, is forecast to remain uncertain this year, the corporate bond investment channel will face quite a few challenges. The first is that with growing inflationary pressure due to the effects of supply chain disruptions and soaring commodity prices worldwide, investment channels with a fixed income such as bonds will be badly hit as they become less attractive and limit investorsï¿½?choices. Persistently low interest rates make bank deposits less than attractive than corporate bonds, thus making it easy for businesses to sell debt. So far this year, the market has seen bank deposit rates and interbank rates rising steadily. Most organizations forecast that if deposit rates increase again this year, they will only inch up by no more than half a percentage point. However, as central banks around the globe are tightening their monetary policies faster, with the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), for example, expected to hike its interest rate seven times this year, plus inflation if it escalates out of control, the volatility of interest rates will be more unpredictable. Rising interest rates cause businesses to pay higher coupons for their debt issues, thereby increasing risks, and making buyers more cautious, especially after a series of warnings against this investment channel recently and concerning the regulations on tightening control over this market. Citing banks, the main buyers in the booming corporate bond market in recent years, as an example, Circular 16/2021/TT-NHNN on credit institutions and foreign bank branches trading in corporate bonds became effective mid-January 2022 with stricter regulations. Specifically, investors can only purchase bonds from issuers with no bad debts arising in the last 12 months (at any credit institution). They may not buy back unlisted corporate bonds already sold and/or bonds issued in the same batch/lot as the bonds sold within 12 months. They are also not allowed to sell corporate bonds to their subsidiaries. Banks tend to focus on short-term credit channels, and corporate bonds will be the channel for enterprises to arrange medium- and long-term loans. The credit banks extend to their corporate clients via investment in corporate bonds will become more limited, according to SSI Securities Corporation. Moreover, in early December 2021, the Ministry of Finance sent an official letter asking for opinions on the draft amendments to Decree 153 with more stringent requirements added for issuers. While the demand side suffers from the above impacts, suppliers have to not only withstand the pressure to accelerate their issuance before the regulation on credit rating takes effect from the beginning of next year, but also deal with a considerable amount of bonds to fall due starting this year. Statistics show that more than 40% of the outstanding corporate bonds will fall due in 2022-2023. This year, in particular, will see some VND266 trillion worth of corporate bonds due, the highest ever, up 39% from 2020 and accounting for about 19% of the volume in circulation. However, the peak of corporate bond maturity with a total value of VND302.9 trillion will fall in 2023, and then VND281.7 trillion in 2024. Therefore, the business community has to prepare new sources of capital for rotation right in 2022, particularly to take advantage of interest rates, which are still at a pleasant level despite signs of an upward trend. Many believe such a large amount of corporate bonds falling due is like having a ticking time bomb in the market, especially considering the current macroeconomic context and the changes in policies toward tougher control. Management agencies once emphasized that certain risky areas with unhealthy indications, such as corporate bonds, may not get accelerated in 2022. Issuers who fall short of the safety threshold may even become the subject of inspection. This will be a great hindrance for businesses looking to issue more bonds without meeting the criteria set by the new regulations.x"
695,0,"Clickbait, conspiracy theories and hate speech: Facebook has become a hellscape ï¿½?and thereâs no way out",1178 words,Independent Online,"My account hadnât been used for close to a year. Logging in required me to change my password, verify my identity through a defunct email address, and agree to three different sets of terms and conditions. Sending a birthday message should have been simple. After all, part of Facebookâs appeal when I first signed up for an account in 2008 was its cleanness, its uniformity, its ease of communication ï¿½?a far stretch from the clutter of Myspace and Bebo. Yet, for close to half an hour, I scoured a friendâs Facebook page ï¿½?which was covered in articles from fake news websites, gambling ads and scores from Facebook games heâd been playing ï¿½?to look for a place to send a public message. I also wasnât sure if he was still using his Facebook account, as neither the posts or pictures on his Facebook wall were listed chronologically, while some of the posts, shared from other accounts and groups, seemed uncharacteristic of him, implying that his account might have been hacked. This weird arrangement of posts, videos, shares and likes werenât just limited to his account either ï¿½?it had happened to my dormant account too. Browsing through my profile, I found that my Facebook feed had been filled with updates from Facebook groups I had no memory of joining: some of which had changed from meme pages and local community groups to pages advertising cryptocurrency scams, pyramid schemes aimed at stay-at-home mothers, deepfake gifs of celebrities, and strange viral videos (including a video of a woman making cocktails in a toilet bowl[http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=44681X1458326&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgloss%2Fposts%2Fwoman-uses-toilet-to-make-ice-cream-candy-and-soda-punch-drinks-for-party-guests%2F823691621578632%2F&sref=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/facebook-meta-instagram-millenials-b2016274.html]) that had received tens of thousands of views. The Facebook I had joined in my late teens and documented my early twenties in ï¿½?the one that was instrumental to forging my friendships and relationships ï¿½?was long gone. Instead, I found myself in a weird digital dystopia: one that contained fragments of my past but was enmeshed in an amalgamation of strange and bizarre content that bore no resemblance to my current life at all. It turns out that this problem is extremely common for Facebook users. News headlines often focus on Facebookâs political effects ï¿½?from misinformation and promoting extremism, to its scant regard for the protection of user data. But, on a superficial level, Facebook as a platformï¿½?sucks. As a recent Forbes article, in which the writer Paul Tassi struggles to figure out why heâs seeing and reading content that he was neither tagged in nor subscribed to, puts it: âItâs just a very, very exhausting and irritating platform to consume and utilise ï¿½?Itâs increasingly useless for what it was originally intended to be.ï¿½? Facebookâs mess is partly the result of its dependence on automation, and having a penchant for changing and altering its content recommendation algorithms. In 2015, Mark Zuckerberg announced that the platform would be concentrating its resources on video-based content, leading to news websites restructuring, laying off thousands of people to make way for a video revolution that never happened[https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/facebook-online-video-pivot-metrics-false.html]. A few years later, realising that the strategy to become a news publisher was doomed to fail, the platform attempted and failed to launch a cryptocurrency[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/facebooks-libra-cryptocurrency-project-ends-in-failure-cxvnnc3kx], before trying to once again restructure its news feed, focusing on âgroupsï¿½?and âsocial connectivityï¿½?rather than news and entertainment. Its restructuring meant that an automated algorithm would recommend content it believed a userâs close friends were engaging with[https://www-washingtonpost-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/technology/interactive/2021/how-facebook-algorithm-works/] ï¿½?perhaps a good idea in theory, but one that failed in practice, as the platformâs content creators realised they could easily manipulate views and shares by posting videos across an unlimited number of pages of their own[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-disinformation-idUSKBN1WB0ED]. It might be easy to dismiss Facebook ï¿½?to assume that, like Myspace, Bebo and Friendster before it, the platform will die a quiet death as we move on to different ones, or even get off social media entirely. But, while Facebookâs user experience might be disorientating, it still remains the biggest social media platform in the world, with close to 3 billion daily active users[https://www-statista-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/#:~:text=With%20roughly%202.89%20billion%20monthly,most%20popular%20social%20network%20worldwide.], most of whom use it as their primary means of social communication. That also means a large number of those users ï¿½?hundreds of millions ï¿½?will be instantly exposed to content that is specifically designed to trump Facebookâs recommendation algorithm, and have often been promoted to the top of the feed through artificially inflated social media metrics. Sometimes, this content might be weird, but overall it is made up of harmless viral videos and images.

To put it simply: Facebookâs relentless pursuit of scale, to enshrine itself as the worldâs largest social media platform, with the biggest number of users, has resulted in it creating a hellscape that it now depends on to survive. No matter how many rebrands, tweaks or virtual reality overhauls Facebook tries, it is unlikely to ever regain its reputation of being a progressive, forward-thinking social media network. In its desire to control the entirety of information flow on the internet, Facebook has instead created an alternative world: one that bears little resemblance to reality, and that can easily be gamed by deploying bots and outsourcing to click farms or by scammers and users who know how to manipulate its algorithms to get views and shares. While it may survive for longer than its predecessors, Facebook is incapable of being the digital representation of oneâs social life, as it once presented itself to be over a decade ago.

133,0,Maccaâs-mad protesterâs extreme move,490 words,Herald Sunï¿½?- âOnline,"âClosing down is an act of hostility against me and my fellow citizens!ï¿½?the angry protester reportedly shouted. Police were filmed dragging the man away as people watched on. The fast-food giant last week announced it was closing its 850 restaurants in Russia, joining a growing tide of companies pulling out of the country following the invasion of Ukraine. âWe cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine,ï¿½?the company said in a statement. âMcDonaldâs has decided to temporarily close all our restaurants in Russia and pause all operations in the market.ï¿½?Russian police detained more than 800 people for protesting Moscowâs âmilitary operationï¿½?in Ukraine on Sunday, as the conflict continues for a third week. OVD-Info, which monitors arrests during protests, said police had detained 817 people during demonstrations in 37 cities in Russia. An AFP journalist reporting from a protest in the capital Moscow witnessed at least a dozen arrests and said police were taking away anybody without press papers. A young woman was shouting âpeace to the worldï¿½?as she was taken away by two policemen, the journalist said. Some of the riot police had the letter âZï¿½?in the colours of the Russian flag on their helmets, the AFP reporter said. The letter, seen on Russian tanks and vehicles in Ukraine, has become a symbol of support for what Moscow calls its âspecial military operationï¿½? Law enforcement in Moscow said Sunday evening they had detained around 300 people in the capitalâs centre for breaches of public order. In Russiaâs second city Saint Petersburg, AFP saw multiple arrests, including a protester being dragged across the ground. The cityâs central Nevsky Avenue was closed off by police with a dozen police vans parked along the road. According to AFP, several journalists were detained. Dressed in a yellow hat and blue jacket, 20-year-old Kristina said she was âexpressing her protestï¿½?by wearing the colours of the Ukrainian flag. âItâs scary to go outside, of course. They are detaining everyone. Lots of my friends have been detained in the past few days, some were even expelled from university,ï¿½?she told AFP. Last weekend, police arrested more than 5000 protesters across Russia. Protesters risk fines and possible prison sentences by taking to the streets. OVD-Info says that 14,804 people have been detained at rallies across the country to protest Russian military incursion in Ukraine, which was launched on February 24."

977,0,UPDATE 1ST LEAD German shipbuilder MV Werften files for insolvency By dpa correspondents,383 words,dpa International Service in English,"The company's employees, numbering some 1,900 people, had been informed of the step, a spokesperson said earlier. Their future is now uncertain. The news marks the failure of negotiations between the German federal government and the regional authorities in Mecklenburg-Vorpormmern on the one hand and owner Genting Hong Kong on the other. The German government had reportedly been ready to step in with a rescue package and further state aid, but demanded a contribution from the owner, which was apparently not forthcoming. The president of Genting Hong Kong, Colin Au, recently said that his firm had made four offers for further financing for MVÂ Werften to the German government, but all of them had been rejected. MVÂ Werften is in the middle of building a 1.5-billion-euro (1.7-billion-dollar) cruiser named ""Global Dream,"" but has not been able to secure the financing to finish the project.  Genting Hong Kong acquired the shipyards in Rostock, Wismar and Stralsund in 2016 as a way to stock up its own fleet. At the time, the cruise industry was booming. The Asian tourism group operates cruise ships under the brands Star Cruises, Dream Cruises and Crystal Cruises as well as Resorts World Manila. The company is backed by the Genting Group - a conglomerate of Malaysian casino magnate and billionaire Lim Kok Thay.  Genting Hong Kong suffered a loss of 1.72 billion dollars in 2020 alone. In the first half of last year, the losses were reduced to 231 million US dollars. Trading in Genting Hong Kong shares was suspended on the Hong Stock stock exchange on Friday ""pending the release of an announcement."" # Notebook ## Update ## Note to editors - Releading with insolvency filing, adding Genting president, graf 6, Genting HK business context, grafs 8-9 - dpa photos ## Internet links - [Genting HK trading halt](http://dpaq.de/uM2Pq[http://dpaq.de/uM2Pq])"

340,1,Heard on the Street: You Spend More but Get Less as Inflation Outpaces Retail Sales -- WSJ,501 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"It would be stronger still if it wasn't for what has been going on with inflation. Indeed, the 1.2% increase in consumer prices in March from February that the Labor Department reported earlier this week handily outpaced the gain in retail sales. Some care needs to be taken here, since the broad spending categories covered in the inflation report significantly eclipse those sold by the stores and other sellers included in the retail sales report -- overall consumer spending in March might still have kept up with overall price increases. But looking at what went on with spending at different retailers -- and comparing them with what went on with the prices on the things they sell -- can be instructive. Take for example spending at bars and restaurants. Thursday's report showed that sales at food services and drinking places rose by 1% in March from a month earlier, as the inflation report showed that prices for food away from home rose 0.3% and prices for alcohol away from home rose 0.6%. Translation: People went out more, which is consistent with a shift in spending as pandemic worries ease. On the other hand, sales at grocery stores rose by 1.3%, but that was outpaced by a 1.5% increase in prices paid for food at home. Consistent with people eating out more, grocery carts were a little emptier. This raises the broader question of what will happen in the months ahead if pandemic strains continue to ease. Some of the biggest price gains over the past year have been for goods such as appliances, where demand has been strong since people have been sticking closer to home. But now, when people feel they have the alternative of spending their money on things like concerts and trips, getting a new refrigerator might not be so appealing. In the months ahead there might be a lot of high price tags that begin gathering dust.

The decision comes after the Supreme Court said Axa must pay Â£4.36m to the high end restauranter, after ruling the firm was covered under a business interruption policy for losses it suffered due to lockdown. The ruling came after Corbin & King, which owns eight restaurants across the UK including Colbert in Sloane Square and The Wolseley in Mayfair, was plunged into administration in February after suffering heavy losses during the pandemic. Following the ruling, Axa was granted permission to appeal certain aspects of the Supreme Courtâs decision last month. However, the insurer said it would not be filing an appeal, as it said it is currently working with Corbin & King to file the claim as quickly as possible.  Axaâs decision not to appeal the ruling could open it and other insurers to further claims from other hospitality businesses that suffered losses during the pandemic. The insurerâs decision came as hospitality giant Minor International last week launched a successful takeover of Corbin & King, through an auction organized by the firmâs administrators. The auction saw the Thai firm beat out company co-founder Jeremy King in buying up the restaurateur for Â£60m.

708,1,"Under which government did the price of asado increase the most, under Cristina Kirchner, Mauricio Macri or Alberto FernÃ¡ndez?",788 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"""When we evaluate the historical inflation of the Basket of Meat Cuts we find the following: the roast is the cut that rose the most in the period of Alberto Fernandez with 235%, followed by the buttock with 219.2%, minced meat with 218.4%, shoulder with 217.6% and rump with 203.2%, all increases in the same presidential period,"" the report highlighted. Paradoxically, the current president had made an advertising spot in 2019 and in the face of the electoral campaign in which he talked about the ""lost barbecue"" during the administration of former President Mauricio Macri as a result of the price increase. In the video, a man could be seen at home with a disused grill in the background, covered with tree leaves, while a voice-over lamented the impossibility of making this meal so popular among Argentines. He also promised: ""In a little while, all this will get better"". Meanwhile, if we consider the historical inflation of the farinaceous basket, the result is as follows: wheat flour was the product that increased the most during Cristina Kirchner's term with 233%. It is followed in the same presidential period by French bread with 144%, sweet cookies with 108% and dry noodles with 88%. In turn, white rice with a 121.47% increase, and table bread with 105.91% were the outstanding rises of Alberto Fernandez's term. ""Food inflation in Argentina is high in the last three presidential terms but despite the official price containment programs in basic categories in all cases have increased above the average inflation level of each period. This shows that inflation cannot be contained unless its causes of fiscal and monetary origin are addressed, which has been the only thing not addressed in the same period of time by any of the three governments"" expressed DamiÃ¡n Di Pace, director of the consulting firm Focus Market. The analyst added that these programs ""originated in the second presidency of Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner. However, the farinaceous industry products registered a higher increase at that time than in the accumulated of Alberto FernÃ¡ndez's administration, which has increases very similar to those of Macri's administration for the same period of administration. In all the governments, fiscal and monetary policies were disorderly and in all of them, the market structure and its implications were much more important than a concrete and firm plan to order macroeconomic imbalances"". Food inflation in Argentina has been high in the last three presidential terms, but in spite of official price containment programs in basic categories, in all cases it has increased above the average inflation level of each period (Di Pace). Likewise, the study showed that in the case of the historical inflation of the vegetable basket, potato was the product that increased the most during Cristina Kirchner's term with 1,057.9%. It was followed by lettuce with 880.3%, tomato with 807%, sweet potato with 651%, onion with 447.1% and pumpkin with 318.3 percent. The study concluded that both fruits and vegetables presented strong increases in the different government periods. However, both during the accumulated period of Cristina Kirchner's administration and Alberto FernÃ¡ndez's, the highest increases in these basic categories took place.

279,0,"As Olympic torch is lit in hope, I see light at end of the tunnel",790 words,The Herald,"When Ivy League universities in America are closing their doors and sending students home until August, donât rule out the first cancellation of an Olympic Games since World War II.? The IOC and host nation Japan are still confident that the Games will go ahead as planned, but no one has any real idea on how long this might go on for. Just from athletes I have spoken to, there is definitely real concern over the Games. The concern isnât just over whether the games get cancelled or not. For each individual athlete, it is also over their own preparations. As an athlete, getting sick is never great and if you got this virus bad you might face missing weeks of training. It could result on you missing the podium in Tokyo.? Or missing the Games altogether. Another friend of mine told me of his concerns that if they move the Games then he might not even get selected.? With markets crashing and supermarket shelves being cleared, these are definitely interesting times for everybody. But when you are living during this Covid-19 pandemic with a spinal-cord injury I guess it becomes even more daunting ï¿½?as such an injury can remove your cough and sneeze reflex. With very little core function, the thought of not being able to cough is a pretty scary proposition.? This might not sound too bad. But this virus hits elderly people hard ï¿½?and this also includes your biological age due to underlying medical conditions. So this is a scary time, and I completely feel for everyone in the same boat as me how scary this is.?I remember back to catching the flu in November last year ï¿½?I thought I was going to stop breathing. I couldnât cough to clear my lungs as the level of my injury is right at the nerves which go to the lungs.? It knocked me out for weeks, so I would be lying if I said I wasnât slightly scared of Covid-19 and its possible effects on my lungs.? I am a very optimistic person who always looks for solutions over problems. But I must admit this has got me a little bit shaken.? Watching whatâs happening in Italy has been hard to believe ï¿½?particularly as life seemed to be continuing almost as normal here.? I looked at the MRI of a 44-year-old manâs lungs and it was unbelievable, unfortunately he didnât survive.? So I am staying positive but also taking advice from Austrian neurologist Viktor Frankl.?He speaks of acceptance of your current situation. These are his own words ï¿½?which I have had on my wall for the last four years: âThe meaning of life lies in finding a purpose and taking responsibility for ourselves and other human beings.ï¿½? In other words, by having a clear âwhyï¿½?we can face all the âhowï¿½?questions of life. This has got me through all those hours in hospital and continues to serve me daily.? Thereâs a reason that in-flight safety presentations always instruct us to secure our own oxygen masks before assisting fellow passengers. We canât help others effectively unless we first protect ourselves. So I spoke with a medical oncologist friend and they advised me to self-isolate.? I am now on day four and thinking this could be a long road ahead; thankfully the weather is getting warmer and I got out on my bike for a few laps of Richmond Park. Along with indoor turbo sessions I am well prepared mentally for the process. I guess all my time in hospital equipped my mind to deal with self-isolating. It also probably helps being an introvert.? I canât help but think of the poor people undergoing their cancer treatment right now though, as I prepare for my own hospital appointment in a few weeks, but I am grateful that side of things is under control. My main goal is keeping my immune system strong because another issue I have from my spinal-cord injury is a compromised immune system, thus moving me into a vulnerable group.? Itâs hard to go from a strong athlete to now feeling so vulnerable, but thankfully I have a strong mind."
771,0,âChinese espionageï¿½?blamed as Rupert Murdochâs firm hacked,268 words,Sunday Herald,"The Journal reported that the hacking appeared to date back to February 2020 and that scores of employees had been affected. Hackers were said to have been able to access reportersï¿½?emails and Google Docs, including drafts of articles. News Corp, whose publications and businesses include the New York Post and Journal parent Dow Jones, said it discovered the breach on January 20. It said customer and financial data were so far not affected and company operations were not interrupted. But the potential impact on news reporting and sources is a serious concern. News organisations are prime targets for the worldâs intelligence agencies because their reporters are in constant contact with sources of sensitive information. Journalists and newsrooms from Mexico and El Salvador to Qatar, where Al Jazeera is based, have been hacked with powerful spyware. Mandiant, the cyber security firm investigating the hack, said in a statement that it âassesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit Chinaâs interestsï¿½? The timing of News Corpâs announcement, including in a regulatory filing on Friday, coincided with the opening of the Winter Olympics in Beijing."
607,0,Turn on the tap: $4b worth of pubs change hands in frothy market,805 words,The Sydney Morning Herald - Online,"Pubs' consistent food and liquor revenue, gaming machines, rental income, development profits from renovations and capital growth from underlying land values are making them an attractive investment proposition as COVID-related social distancing restrictions ease and the sector bounces back.  Real Capital Analytics estimates transaction volumes are on course to eclipse previous highs. Sales volumes for pubs dropped precipitously in 2020 after COVID-19 hit, slumping 22 per cent compared to the year before. ""Investors don't appear to have been completely put off by the numerous lockdowns Melbourne has undergone and the one in Sydney,"" RCA's Pacific head of analytics Benjamin Martin-Henry said. HTL Property managing director Andrew Jolliffe, who kicked off the latest transaction bonanza when he negotiated the sale of the Hotel Hollywood in Sydney's Surry Hills in April, says investor interest is at an all-time high. In late December, former Nine Entertainment boss David Gyngell and the widow of the late actor and writer John ""Strop"" Cornell, Delvene Cornell, sold the Hotel Brunswick near Byron Bay for $68 million to listed fund manager MA Financial. And in one of the last big sales of 2021, the Stanford family sold its Riverstone pub known as the Pub @Rivo, in Sydney's west to a private Sydney consortium, headed by PwC Australia legal partner Andrew Wheeler, for around $26.5 million. It was the last of the family's three pubs to find a new owner. Each pub in the portfolio provided extremely rare Western Sydney growth corridor real estate. ""The Stanford family's Sydney portfolio set new benchmarks both in terms of record pricing and yields,"" Jolliffe says. Bruce Solomon, a pub industry veteran, set the bar high with his purchase of the Carousal Inn, in Sydney's western suburb of Rooty Hill, from the Stanford family for an eye-watering $64 million. Solomon runs the Solotel Group with his family and celebrity chef Matt Moran and says pubs are attractive when they are part of a community where locals and visitors relax and enjoy being social after months of lockdowns. Solotel has owned the Darlo bar in Sydney's city fringe for decades and also runs the Opera Bar and Barangaroo House in the city, among other popular venues. ""The pub trade has been remarkably resilient,"" Solomon says. ""The big attraction of hotels is the consistency of revenue. As it used to be in the old days, people still have a drink when they're celebrating or have a drink when they commiserate."" Justin Hemmes's Merivale is setting its sights on building its Victorian portfolio where it splashed out a combined $80 million to purchase the coastal Lorne pub and Tomasetti House in Flinders Lane. The freehold interest in Melbourne's Boronia Hotel sold for $24 million ï¿½?48 hours before the official campaign closed. JLL director pub investment sales John Musca says the sale highlights the ""esteem investors hold in hotels as an asset class, delivering an internal rate of return exceeding any other form of retail property."" Musca says the weight of money looking for pub investments will continue to drive an ""extraordinary period of transactional activity."" Pub veteran Arthur Laundy last year swooped on the Bay View at Woy Woy, on the NSW Central Coast for $38 million. Laundy says community pubs are in ""high demand."" Long-time publican and hotel operator Fraser Short will take the reins of The Sir George from mother-daughter ownership duo Liz Prater and Kate Hufton this February after paying $14 million for the property. On the corporate side, listed property fund manager Charter Hall has become the country's biggest pub owner after investors in landlord ALE Property approved a $1.7 billion takeover. ALE Property was the country's biggest pub landlord with 78 high-profile pubs and bottle shops across the country that are majority-leased to the newly listed drinks and pub operator Endeavour Group. The ALE portfolio will add to the Hostplus and Charter Hall fund's existing portfolio of 62 Endeavour Group's leased assets. The ALE portfolio is attractive as the assets have long-term leases with lengthy options, a quality operator, and low site coverage, which provides redevelopment potential over time and are materially under-rented."

83,0,"Burger King parent company to pull out of Russia after franchisee refused request to close restaurants; Toronto-based Restaurant Brands International Inc . detailed its plans for the market, which included planning to sell its 15-per-cent stake in the business there",803 words,The Globe and Mail (Breaking News),"But those with franchise-operated businesses have discovered that shutting their doors there is not necessarily straightforward. In an interview with The Globe and Mail last week, David Bensadoun , chief executive officer of Montreal-based footwear retailer Aldo Group Inc ., said he was âfuriousï¿½?[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-as-aldo-has-found-shutting-down-russian-operations-is-far-from-simple/] that the companyâs franchisee in Russia was keeping its stores open.  RBI has said in recent weeks that it was pulling corporate support for its Russian operations and redirecting any profits from that business to the United Nationsï¿½?refugee agency . But on Thursday, the company said that it had not been successful in closing the restaurants. Even if RBI successfully sells its stake, under its current contract Burger King could continue to operate in Russia for the foreseeable future. âWe contacted the main operator of the business and demanded the suspension of Burger King restaurant operations in Russia. He has refused to do so,ï¿½?the president of RBI âs international business, David Shear , wrote in the open letter.  RBI operates more than 800 Burger Kings in Russia through three joint-venture partnerships ï¿½?a common business structure for the companyâs operations overseas ï¿½?in which RBI has a 15-per-cent stake. All three of those partnerships are controlled by Alexander Kolobov, who handles the operations; Ukrainian investment firm Investment Capital Ukraine; and VTB Capital , an affiliate of Russiaâs second-largest bank, VTB . According to RBI , VTB also partners with other Western companies in Russia, including other fast-food chains. VTB is among the firms on which Canada and other countries have imposed sanctions. In the letter, Mr. Shear wrote that RBI is in compliance with all sanctions. âWe started the process to dispose our ownership stake in the business. While we would like to do this immediately, it is clear that it will take some time to do so based on the terms of our existing joint venture agreement,ï¿½?Mr. Shear wrote. He added that the company has faced questions about why it is unable to force Burger King restaurants to close. Mr. Shear wrote that the contracts for master franchise agreements and joint ventures that RBI has signed in Russia do not include legal clauses allowing a partner to change or overturn the agreement. âNo serious investor in any industry in the world would agree to a long-term business relationship with flimsy termination clauses. This is exactly why we say itâs a complicated legal process when we are asked why we canât just unilaterally shut down the business,ï¿½?Mr. Shear wrote. âAny current attempt to enforce our contract would ultimately require the support of Russian authorities on the ground and we know that will not practically happen anytime soon.ï¿½?He added that this also explains why other Western brands may continue to operate in Russia. Last week, Yum! Brands Inc . said it would close its 70 corporate-owned KFC locations in Russia, but did not specify whether more than 900 other franchised locations would also close; the company said it was working toward an agreement with its Russian franchisee to close its 50 Pizza Hut locations in the country. This week, the franchise operator in Russia for pizza chain Papa Johnâs told The New York Times he would not close the 190 restaurants his company controls there.  RBI faces a similar issue, Mr. Shear wrote. âWould we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today? No,ï¿½?he wrote. âBut we want to be transparent with our actions and explain the steps we have taken to stand with the international business community in response to Russiaâs attack on Ukraine and its people.ï¿½?Your time is valuable.

662,0,Kremlin website is DOWN: Russian state websites including media watchdog crash and TV channels 'are hacked to broadcast Ukrainian songs',1976 words,Mail Online,"* Kyiv had been hit by a âmassiveï¿½?cyberattack targeting its government and banks before the invasion * The incident could be the first round of tit-for-tat cyberattacks after the West condemned Putin Russian government websites including the official Kremlin and media regulator pages are down, in what could be the first round of tit-for-tat cyberattacks after the West furiously condemned warmonger Vladimir Putinâs invasion of Ukraine. Ukraineâs telecoms agency also announced that Russian TV channels had been hacked to broadcast Ukrainian songs, the Kyiv Independent reported on Saturday afternoon. Just hours before Russiaâs tyrant launched his aggressive war to âdemilitariseï¿½?and âde-Nazifyï¿½?Ukraine, Kyiv was hit by a âmassiveï¿½?cyberattack targeting its government and banks. The websites of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Security Service, and Cabinet of Ministers were all out of action Wednesday afternoon. Bomb threats were also phoned in to several government buildings, thought to be part of a psychological pressure campaign by Moscow. The Russian presidentâs war appears not to be going to plan due to Kremlin âoverconfidenceï¿½? poor tactical planning, and âshockï¿½?at the fierce resistance put up by brave Ukrainians fighting for national survival, intelligence sources have claimed. How Russian hackers could aim to cripple Britain: Cyber attack from Moscow in retaliation for Ukraine sanctions would target UK Government and banking websites Millions of companies across Britain were today warned to prepare for a Russian cyber attack as the UK placed sanctions on three wealthy allies of Vladimir Putin and five banks in response to the 'renewed invasion' of Ukraine.  GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) urged UK organisations to 'bolster their online defences' and warned that there has been an 'historical pattern of cyber attacks on Ukraine with international consequences'. Ukrainian banking and government websites were last week briefly knocked offline by a spate of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks which the US and Britain said were carried out by Russian military hackers ï¿½?something the Russians denied. This will prompt concerns that the same sort of attack could now be attempted in the UK. DDoS attacks try to crash a website by bombarding it with superfluous requests at the same time - and this surge of simple requests overloads the servers, causing them to shut down. In order to leverage the number of requests necessary, hackers will often resort to botnets ï¿½?networks of computers brought under their control with malware. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace also said the UK will launch retaliatory cyber attacks on Russia if it targets Britain's computer networks, and that 'offensive cyber capability' was being developed from a base in North West England. It comes after Home Secretary Priti Patel warned over the weekend that the UK Government expects to see 'cyber attacks aimed at the West', while NCSC chief executive Lindy Cameron told of a 'heightened cyber threat'. And in recent weeks the Financial Conduct Authority watchdog has written to the chief executives of UK banks warning them to brace for Russian-sponsored cyber attacks and to ensure their security systems are updated. Dramatic video shows a destroyed Russian convoy with Z-markings near Kherson in the south of the country on the third day of fighting after Ukraineâs army held control of Kyiv and last night successfully repelled Russian advances on the capital. Kyivâs defence ministry has so far put Russiaâs losses at around 2,800 troops, 80 tanks, 516 armoured vehicles, and 10 airplanes and seven helicopters so far. A senior US defence official said Russia is facing more resistance than Moscow anticipated in its invasion of Ukraine, including in its advance on Kyiv, and appears to have lost some of its momentum. Estoniaâs former defence chief Riho Terras has now claimed that Putinâs war is not going to plan because Russia is fast running out of money and weapons, and will have to enter negotiations with Volodymyr Zelenskyâs government if Kyiv holds off the Russians for 10 days. Russiaâs tyrant has allegedly convened a meeting with the oligarchs in a bunker in the Ural Mountains, at which it is claimed that he furiously vented that he thought the war would be âeasyï¿½?and âeverything would be done in one to four daysï¿½? Citing Ukrainian intelligence sources, Terras claimed that the war is costing Russia around Â£15billion-per-day, and that they have rockets for three to four days at most, which they are using sparingly. He claimed that Putinâs plan has relied on panicking the country, firing missiles at residential buildings âat randomï¿½?to âintimidateï¿½?the Ukrainians, trigger mass army desertions, national surrender, and Zelenskyâs flight from the country. Terras also alleged that Russian special operations have been near Kyiv since February 18, and had planned to swiftly seize the capital and install a puppet regime. âThe Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered. The Ukrainians must avoid panic! ... Ukraine must stay strong and we must provide assistance!ï¿½? he wrote on Twitter. Russiaâs Interfax news agency claimed Moscow had captured the southeastern city of Melitopol. Ukrainian officials were not immediately available to comment on the fate of Melitopol. If the Interfax report about Melitopol, which cited Russiaâs defence ministry, is confirmed, it would be the first significant population centre that the Kremlin has seized. However, Britainâs armed forces minister James Heappey cast doubt on the report, saying the city of some 150,000 people was still in Ukrainian hands and that fighting in the capital was so far confined to âvery isolated pockets of Russian special forces and paratroopersï¿½?and that âthe main armoured columns approaching Kyiv are still some way offï¿½? The Ukrainian health minister said 198 people have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded in the Russian offensive. Viktor Lyashko said there were three children among those killed. His statement was unclear whether the casualties included military and civilians. He said another 1,115 people, including 33 children, were wounded in the Russian invasion.  Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov claimed Saturday that since the start of Moscowâs attack, its military had hit 821 Ukrainian military facilities, 87 tanks and other targets. Konashenkov didnât say how many Ukrainian troops were killed and didnât mention any casualties on the Russian side. Neither his claims nor Ukraineâs allegations that its forces killed thousands of Kremlin troops could be independently verified. Russian forces continued to pound Kyiv and other cities with artillery and cruise missiles in a campaign that has sent hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing westwards towards the European Union, clogging major highways and railway lines. Top Russian security official and ex-president Dmitry Medvedev said military operations would be waged relentlessly until Putinâs goals were achieved, ratcheting up Moscowâs rhetoric. Medvedev said new sanctions on Russia were a sign of the Westâs impotence in the conflict and he hinted at a severing of diplomatic ties, saying it was time to âpadlock the embassiesï¿½? The United States has observed more than 250 launches of Russian missiles, mostly short-range, at Ukrainian targets, the US defence official said. âWe know that (Russian forces) have not made the progress that they wanted to make, particularly in the north. They have been frustrated by what they have seen is a very determined resistance,ï¿½?the official said, without providing evidence. The Kremlin said Putin had ordered troops to stop advancing on Friday but they were moving forwards again on Saturday after Kyiv refused to negotiate. Hacking collective Anonymous declares 'cyber war' against Vladimir Putin's government before announcing they have 'taken down' website of Kremlin-backed TV channel RT Hacking group Anonymous has declared 'cyber war' against Vladimir Putin's government after he mounted a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The elusive computer experts issued the stark announcement on their Twitter account on Thursday evening. They said shortly before 10pm: 'The Anonymous collective is officially in cyber war against the Russian government.' Around 30 minutes later, they announced that they had taken down the website of the Kremlin-backed TV channel RT, which broadcasts in Britain and has been heavily criticised for its coverage. The cyber war declaration raises the prospect that Russia could be subjected to systematic hacking attempts in the coming days. An adviser to Zelensky denied that Kyiv had refused negotiations but said Russia had attached unacceptable conditions. He also said it was untrue that Russia had paused troop movements on Friday. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who has fostered good ties with Russia and Ukraine, told Zelensky by phone on Saturday that Ankara was making efforts for an immediate ceasefire. Kyivâs mayor Vitali Klitschko said there was currently no major Russian military presence in the capital, but that saboteur groups were active. The metro system serves now only as a shelter for citizens and trains have stopped running, he said. Klitschko said 35 people, including two children, had been wounded overnight and that he was extending an overnight curfew that kicked in at 5pm (1500 GMT). In an emotional speech to the besieged nation uploaded to Facebook on Friday, the Ukrainian President also accused Moscow of attempting to seize Kyiv, overthrow the government and install a âpuppetï¿½?regime âlike in Donetskï¿½? one of two separatist regions which warmonger Vladimir Putin officially recognised before launching an all-out invasion. Declaring âwe derailed their ideaï¿½? Zelensky added: âThe fights are going on in many cities and areas of our state. But we know that we are protecting the country, the land, the future of our children. Kyiv and key cities around the capital are controlled by our army. âThe [Russian] occupants wanted to block the centre of our state and put here their marionette, like in Donetsk. We derailed their idea.ï¿½?Zelensky pushed for Ukraineâs urgent ascension to the European Union, saying he discussed the issue with the EU leaders. He also urged cutting Russia from the SWIFT international electronic bank payment system, noting that Germany and Hungary should show âcourageï¿½?and agree to the move. Briefly switching to Russian, he claimed that thousands of Kremlin troops were killed and hundreds of those who were taken prisoner âcanât understand why they were sent into Ukraine to kill and get killedï¿½? Thanking Russians who spoke out against the war and asked them to keep up the pressure on the Kremlin, he said: âThe sooner you say to your government that this war should be immediately stopped, the more of your people will stay alive.ï¿½?After Ukrainian forces said they had fought off a Russian attack on their capital Saturday, Zelensky shot a selfie-style video outside his office to vow to stay and fight on. He also denounced as disinformation allegations that he had surrendered or fled. Wearing olive green military-style clothing and looking tired but determined, he added: âA lot of fake information has appeared on the internet saying that I allegedly called on our army to lay down its arms and that evacuation is underway. Our truth is that this is our land, our country, our children and we will protect all of this. This is what I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine!ï¿½? As the video hit social media platforms, the sounds of explosions and air raid sirens could still be heard around the capital, as the Russian military said it had fired cruise missiles at Ukrainian military targets."
251,0,New ï¿½?00m Travelodge hotel closes; Hotel hired exclusively by the State to accommodate people seeking asylum,527 words,The Irish Times,"It is believed that its owner, the Tifco hotel group, recently signed a deal with the International Protection Accommodation Service (Ipas) division of the Department of Children, which is responsible for housing people seeking refuge in Ireland. Tifco declined to comment on the deal last night, while the department had made no response prior to publication to a request for comment. Tifco was still publicly touting the impending opening of the Travelodge Plus shortly before Christmas. Not open However, potential customers who contact the hotel to inquire about bookings are being told by staff members that it is currently not open to the public as it has been booked out by a large customer. The new hotel is listed as unavailable on all major hospitality booking platforms such as Booking.com, although it does appear to be possible to book rooms at the hotel from June, which suggests that the deal to operate exclusively as a centre for asylum seekers may be of limited duration. The deal is the second major transaction in the Dublin hotel market in recent weeks by Ipas. The new 421-bedroom Holiday Inn at Dublin Airport, which opened its doors last July, has shut to the public and is operating as a centre for asylum seekers for the next year at least. Ipas is understood to have engaged agents to find new private sector sources of accommodation to relieve some of the strain on the direct provision system, following a spike of 3,300 new asylum seekers who have arrived in Ireland since October, when pandemic travel rules eased internationally. Ipas is said to be extremely active in the hotel market. It is believed to be offering some hoteliers deals of about ï¿½?00 per room per night to house asylum seekers. Sources have said that some hotels have signed deals guaranteeing 100 per cent occupancy at those rates. Tifco, which is owned by US private equity group Apollo, could expect to be paid close to ï¿½?.2 million per month by the State for the exclusive use of the new Travelodge Plus at those rates. The State has contracts to house asylum seekers with about 40 different hotels. It recently closed a tender for a panel of new accommodation providers, including hotels for single people and couples and ""own door"" facilities for families. It estimated that the value of the tender could be ï¿½?00 million over the next 34 months, when the system of direct provision is set to be overhauled. The Tifco hotel group owns or operates about 25 hotels in the Irish market, including 11 under the Travelodge franchise."
997,0,Insolvency plea filed over payment default: Bank of India moves NCLT against Future Retail,380 words,Financial Express,"According to banking sources, the Future Groupâs flagship Future Retail has already slipped into the non-performing asset (NPA) asset bucket in January and the 40% provisions taken against that account will show in banksï¿½?Q4FY22 financial results. Amid the legal battle between the Future Group, Amazon and Reliance Retail, bankers continue to bet on Reliance taking over the Future Groupâs assets with the offered amount of over Rs 24,000 crore.  Future Retailâs accounts had been restructured under the resolution framework for Covid-related stress proposed by the Kamath committee. It first failed to repay its dues worth Rs 3,494.56 crore in December 2021 and then to cure the default during the next one month, as required under the terms of restructuring. In March, lenders to the retailer Future Retail had issued a notice in order to secure their interest in the event of a transfer of assets owned by the company, raising speculation that they might move the debt recovery tribunal (DRT) to recover their dues. Bankers later characterised that action as more of a knee-jerk reaction against Reliance Retailâs move to take over 947 Future Group stores.

645,1,"Press Release: Livanta Launches New Publication, The Livanta Claims Review Advisor, for Healthcare Providers",629 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"In 2021, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) awarded Livanta a national contract to conduct claim reviews for Medicare. Claim review services represent an important activity of advancing Medicare's aims of better health, better care, and lower costs. Medicare's claim review program includes activities that evaluate the following two main types of Medicare Part A claims that have a high potential for errors: (1) Hospital inpatient admissions of short duration, and (2) Re-submitted claims for higher payments than initially billed under IPPS with a DRG, i.e., a higher-weighted DRG (HWDRG). Livanta's Chief Medical Officer, Ellen R. Evans, MD, a Board-certified Family Physician and Geriatrician, stated, ""The Livanta team of clinicians brings exemplary experience, knowledge, understanding, and skill to this workload. Through this work, Livanta recognizes the significance of claim reviews to ensure appropriate Medicare billing to protect the Medicare Trust Fund. This new publication is one more way that Livanta provides valuable education to the healthcare provider community."" Medicare uses DRG codes to determine reimbursement to hospitals of acute-care inpatient claims. DRG coding helps ensure equitable payments across various patient conditions and locations. Submitting adjustments to claims that result in higher-weighted DRG codes may trigger reviews of inpatient claims. Claim reviews for short hospital stays focus on the claims submitted by providers for patients admitted to the hospital but discharged less than two days later.

In addition, the Chloraka mayor said that residents of 25 different nationalities live and work in the area, noting that a large percentage of them own real estate. Finally, Liasides added that Chloraka also has 5,500 properties, 300 businesses and 3,200 privately owned residences, of which 2,000 are apartments for rent, as well as permanent and temporary residences.

196,0,"UPDATE 3-McDonald's , icon of post-Soviet era, to close all restaurants in Russia",709 words,Reuters News,"NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp said on Tuesday it would temporarily close all 847 of its restaurants in Russia including its iconic Pushkin Square location, increasing pressure on other global brands to pause operations in the country following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The closure of the McDonald's restaurants will also carry symbolic importance in Russia, where the first location to open, in central Moscow in 1990, became a symbol of flourishing American capitalism as the Soviet Union fell.  McDonald's said it would continue to pay salaries to its 62,000 employees in Russia. Because of its large size and global reach, the chain is often copied by other brands if it takes a stance on an issue or makes a major operational change. ""If they decide to do something, then probably others will follow,"" said international franchise consultant William Edwards of companies' conversations about whether to follow McDonald's by closing locations in Russia on moral grounds. Major global brands, including McDonald's and PepsiCo Inc , have been pressured to withdraw from Russia by consumers and investors including the New York state's pension fund. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""  McDonald's opened in Pushkin Square 32 years ago as the Soviet Union was collapsing. That new restaurant represented the thawing Cold War tensions at a time when some young Russians were desperate to get their hands on blue jeans and other Americana. ""It's impossible to predict when we might be able to reopen our restaurants in Russia,"" McDonald's CEO, Chris Kempczinski , said in a note emailed companywide on Tuesday and posted on the company's website. ""We are experiencing disruptions to our supply chain along with other operational impacts. We will also closely monitor the humanitarian situation."" Paul Musgrave, a University of Massachusetts political science professor, said the McDonald's closures show how the quick and broad imposition of Western sanctions on Russia will have a lasting economic impact. He also said the decision puts to rest the theory that business ties will inevitably lead to closer U.S.-Russian relations. ""It's the spiritual end to any hope that commercial ties by themselves would sustain political integration."" Added Jeffrey Sonnenfeld , a professor at the Yale School of Management who is tracking major companies' stances on Russia: ""I'm so glad that they realized it's a complicated situation, and I'm glad they came around and made the right decision ... It's a really important impact, and it's symbolic as much as it is substantive."" Of its nearly 850 Russian McDonald's locations, 84% are owned by the company. The remainder are mostly operated by Moscow-based franchisee Rosinter Restaurants Holding . COMPLEXITIES Because McDonald's owns many locations in Russia, it has more direct access to shutting operations. That may not be as easy for other fast-food chains in Russia - including Yum Brands Inc's KFC and Pizza Hut , Restaurant Brands International 's Burger King , Subway, Papa John's International Inc , Starbucks Corp and Domino's Pizza Inc . The companies' Russian locations are almost entirely run by independent operators and subject to complex international franchise agreements. For example, Burger King 's owner, Restaurant Brands, on Tuesday told Reuters that because Burger King ""is a stand-alone business owned and operated by franchisees in Russia,"" the company has ""long-standing legal agreements that are not easily changeable in the foreseeable future."" Some fast-food franchisees with locations in Russia are not even based in Russia, such as Netherlands-based DP Eurasia , which runs Domino's restaurants in Russia, as well as in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia. ""These are often long, complicated, heavily negotiated agreements. Every one of them can be different from everyone else,"" said Larry Weinberg, who chairs the franchise practice at the law firm Cassels Brock & Blackwell LLP .

960,1,"World Supply Chain Analytics Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report 2022-2030: Demand for Managing Vast Volumes of Company Data and Its Insights for Strategic Applications Grows - ResearchAndMarkets.com",957 words,Business Wire,"The global supply chain analytics market size is expected to reach USD 22.46 billion by 2030, registering a CAGR of 17.6% from 2022 to 2030. Supply chain analytics is becoming popular as the demand for managing vast volumes of company data and its insights for strategic applications grows. As the demand for automation technologies and investment from technology developers grows, so does the demand for cognitive computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The growing awareness among businesses about the advantages of Supply Chain Analytics (SCA) in terms of improved visibility across the whole supply chain is fueling the demand for analytics solutions. The increased availability of cloud-based SCA solutions has triggered their demand among small & medium enterprises owing to benefits such as easy deployment, shorter implementation window, effective use of IT resources, and flexibility & mobility offered by these solutions. Another notable trend in the market is the increased demand for risk analytics solutions across all industries. Risk analytics solutions address multiple issues associated with the supply chain by analyzing scenario and sensitivity, stochastic optimization, and risk mitigation. SCA solutions enable enterprises to achieve growth, enhance profitability, and increase market share by utilizing the derived insights in making strategic decisions. Improved visibility across the supply chain can help organizations enhance sustainability, reduce inventory cost, and accelerate the time-to-market for products in the long run. Factors such as shortening product life cycles, low visibility in traditional supply chains, ineffective supplier networks, elevated warehousing costs, redundant forecasts, and fluctuating customer demands necessitate supply chain optimization, thereby driving the growth of the market. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have an adverse short-term impact on the market. The pandemic has compelled several manufacturing companies to temporarily halt manufacturing operations to comply with the new government regulations. Revenue streams have been directly affected due to the pandemic, as supply chain and trade disruptions have adversely affected the overall operations. However, for supply chain management technology vendors, the crisis is expected to provide a significant opportunity to increase their revenue shares, by offering advanced technology-based supply chain solutions. Customer enterprises across the globe need to identify how supply chain analytics solutions can better prepare them for demand fluctuations, challenging conditions, and macroeconomic instability post the crisis. Improved effectiveness of business outcomes and cost-effectiveness of supply chain management resulting from the adoption of supply chain analytics is also expected to encourage the adoption of supply chain analytics solutions in several end-use applications. The demand is expected to remain robust in retail and consumer products, healthcare, and manufacturing industries. Furthermore, the capacity of the market to offer effective and efficient administration of end-to-end business processes is likely to drive its expansion over the forecast period. Supply Chain Analytics Market Report Highlights -- In terms of solution, the sales & operations analytics segment is anticipated to register considerable growth over the forecast period, attributed growing use of machine learning in SCA solutions is an emerging trend.

528,1,Increased tax revenue mop-up keeps India on track to becoming $5 trn economy: FinMin,481 words,Financial Express Online,"""The central governmentâs focus on making India a global economic powerhouse and the host of measures adopted towards this commitment has directly reflected in Indiaâs GDP growth in recent years. ""This has translated into increased revenue collection for the exchequer while keeping India well on the track towards achieving a USD 5 trillion economyï¿½?"" the ministry said in a statement. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019 envisioned making India a USD 5 trillion economy and a global economic powerhouse. The Indian GDP is estimated to be around USD 3 trillion in 2021-22. The ministry said apart from a brief setback owing to COVID-19, the government has maintained the nominal GDP growth above 10 per cent in recent years. GST, a simplified way of collecting indirect taxes, has been a revolutionary step propelling Indiaâs GDP. ""With a big push to capex in the Union Budget of 2022-23, the coming years are going to see a surge in domestic manufacturing as well as growth in employment. These in turn will directly boost tax contribution to the exchequer,"" the ministry said. The gross corporate taxes during 2021-22 was Rs 8.6 lakh crore against Rs 6.5 lakh crore in the previous year. This, the ministry said, shows that the new simplified tax regime with low rates and no exemptions has lived up to its promise, enhancing Ease of Doing Business for the corporate sector, stimulating Indiaâs economy and increasing tax revenues for the government. In the last fiscal year, direct tax collection rose by a record 49 per cent to Rs 14.10 lakh crore, while indirect taxes recorded a growth of 20 per cent to Rs 12.90 lakh croreï¿½?reflecting buoyancy in economy and the impact of anti-tax evasion measures. For the current fiscal year, capital expenditure (capex) is budgeted to rise by 35.4 per cent to Rs 7.5 lakh crore to continue the public investment-led recovery of the pandemic-battered economy. The capex last year was pegged at Rs 5.5 lakh crore.  Tax revenues in last fiscal year grew by a record 34 per cent to Rs 27.07 lakh crore, which the ministry said is ""a remarkable testimony to the rapid recovery"" of the economy following successive waves of COVID-19.[https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/1-394.jpg]"

61,0,Shanghai Disney Resort To Close Over Covid Wave,306 words,The Wall Street Journal,"China reported 1,656 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases on Saturday, health authorities said, compared with about 70 cases at the beginning of the month. Meanwhile, mainland China reported its first deaths from Covid-19 in more than a year on Saturday. Two patients died of Covid-19 in the northeastern province of Jilin, China's National Health Commission said. The deaths on Friday are the nation's first recorded fatalities since Jan. 26, 2021.  Walt Disney Co., a minority owner in the Chinese resort, said its theme parks and resorts generated record income in its fiscal first quarter, signaling that the worst of the damage the company suffered from the coronavirus pandemic may be behind it. Shanghai Disneyland, which first opened in 2016, was the first Disney park to close as the pandemic spread in early 2020. Disney later closed all of its parks, costing the company billions of dollars in revenue. Shanghai Disneyland reopened in May 2020. In late October, Shanghai Disneyland locked more than 30,000 visitors inside its theme park and forced them to take Covid-19 tests after one customer came back positive for the virus-- an example of the zero-tolerance policy imposed by the Chinese government. China is attempting to move on from its so-called Covid-Zero lockdown measures in favor of a more precise approach to containing the virus that is less damaging to its economy.

388,1,Swindon employment is still below pre-Covid levels,416 words,Swindon Advertiser,"Office for National Statistics data shows113,106 people in Swindon were in payrolled employment in March,which isup from 112,949 the month before, and from 110,634 in March 2021. At the start of the pandemic, 114,723 people were in payrolled jobs in the area. Different figures show that across the UK, the unemployment rate hit 3.8 per centin the three months to February ï¿½?it has not been lower than this since 1974. Andthere has been a fall in the number of people claiming unemployment benefits in the Swindon area over the last year, with around 5,465 peopleon out-of-work benefits as of March 10, which is down by 2,695 from 8,160 at the same point the year before. It meant 3.9 per centof the area's working population sought support in March. The figures include those aged 16 to 64 on Jobseekerâs Allowance and some Universal Credit claimantswho are unemployed and seeking work or employed but with low earnings. The ONS said real pay was now ""falling noticeably"", with regular wages excluding bonuses tumbling 1.8 per centafter inflation in the three months to February - the steepest decline in almost nine years.  Frances OâGrady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the Chancellor of the Exchequerhas done little to help families. ""By holding down pay in the public sector and cutting Universal Credit, he has made the crisis worse,"" said Ms O'Grady. ""Families need help now. Whoever is Chancellor tomorrow should go to Parliament with an emergency budget to help with surging energy bills and to get wages rising."" Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The sheer scale of this inflation-led squeeze of living standards makes it all the more remarkable how little support the Chancellor provided in his spring statement"". Mr Sunakhighlighted the Â£22 billion in support that the government is providing in 2022-23. Employment minister Mims Davies added the government is ""doing everything we can to help"", including supporting people in moving into better paid, higher skilled work and increasing the National Living and Minimum Wage."
195,0,McDonaldâs to temporarily close restaurants in Russia as Moscowâs isolation deepens,682 words,Cyprus Mail,"The fast-food chain said it would go on paying salaries to its 62,000 employees in Russia. Earlier on Tuesday, Shell SHEL.L stopped buying oil from Russia and said it would cut links to the country entirely while the United States stepped up its campaign to punish Moscow by banning Russian oil and energy imports. The Westâs moves to isolate Russia economically for attacking its neighbour have turbocharged global commodity and energy markets, sending prices soaring and threatening to derail the nascent recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Britain too said it would ban imports of Russian oil but only by gradually phasing them out during 2022 to give businesses time to find alternative sources of supply. The surge in metal prices since Russia attacked Ukraine is starting to hurt some players caught on the wrong side of the market, as well as end consumers such as carmakers.  The London Metal Exchange (LME ) halted trade in nickel on Tuesday after prices of the metal, a key component in electric vehicle batteries, doubled to more than $100,000 a tonne.  Shell âs decision to abandon Russia comes days after it faced a hail of criticism for buying Russian oil ï¿½?a transaction that two weeks ago would have been routine ï¿½?underlining how Moscowâs pariah status is growing even in a market it used to dominate. âWe are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil to be refined into products like petrol and diesel ï¿½?despite being made with security of supplies at the forefront of our thinking ï¿½?was not the right one, and we are sorry,ï¿½?Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said. Although no sanctions have yet forced such divestments, Shell and rivals BP BP.L and Exxon Mobil XOM.N have all announced plans to sell holdings in Russia and exit the country, leaving Franceâs TotalEnergies TTEF.PA relatively isolated in hanging onto its investments there. HYBRID DELAYS Dozens of companies have shut down activity in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow has termed a âspecial military operationï¿½?aimed not at occupying territory but at destroying Ukraineâs military capabilities. German sportswear maker Adidas ADSGn.DE, cosmetics firm Estee Lauder EL.N, and Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger owner PVH Corp PVH.N are among the latest brands to announce the suspension of activities there. The conflict has roiled global stock markets as investors have worried about its economic fallout, putting in doubt market listings, including that of Malaysiaâs Top Glove Corp Bhd . It has also driven a surge in commodity prices, which mining group BHP BHP.AX warned could spill over into already skyrocketing inflation and potentially affect global growth. Nickel prices soared when Chinaâs Tsingshan Holding Group, one of the worldâs top nickel and stainless steel producers, bought large amounts of nickel to reduce its bets that prices would fall, three sources familiar with the matter said. Tsingshan and the LME declined to comment As well as high-grade nickel, the price of other metals used in car production, from aluminium in bodywork to palladium in catalytic converters, has soared, and industry supply chains have been broken. Read full story  Volkswagen said it would stop taking orders for numerous plug-in hybrid models from Wednesday, as supply chain troubles exacerbated the production delays caused by chip shortages. The carmaker had already halted production in Russia and has also suspended production at several factories in Germany as it has struggled to obtain components. Orders for the plug-in hybrid versions of Volkswagen âs Golf, Tiguan, Passat, Arteon and Touareg models would be halted until further notice and delivery of already placed orders might not happen this year, the company said."

56,1,Worldwide semiconductor revenue grew 26.3% in 2021 to $595 billion: Gartner,556 words,BusinessLine Online,"âThe events behind the current chip shortage continue to impact original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) around the world, but the 5G smartphone ramp up and a combination of strong demand and logistics/raw material price increases drove semiconductor average selling prices (ASPs) higher, contributing to significant revenue growth in 2021,ï¿½?said Andrew Norwood, research vice president at Gartner. Top players  Samsung Electronics regained the top spot from Intel for the first time since 2018, though by less than a percentage point, with revenue growing 28 per cent in 2021.  Intelâs revenue declined 0.3 per cent, garnering 12.2 per cent market share compared to Samsungâs 12.3 per cent market share.  Intel was followed by SK Hynix, Micron Technology and Qualcomm with 6.1 per cent, 4.8 per cent and 4.6 per cent market share, respectively in 2021. Broadcom held a 3.2 per cent share. Within the top 10, AMD and Mediatek experienced the strongest growth in 2021 at 68.6 per cent and 60.2 per cent growth, respectively with a market share of 2.7 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively.  Texas Instruments took the seventh spot in the top 10 with a 2.9 per cent share while NVIDIA took the ninth spot with a 2.8 per cent market share. The most significant shift among the semiconductor vendor ranking in 2021 was HiSilicon dropping out of the top 25. HiSiliconâs revenue declined 81 per cent, from $8.2 billion in 2020 to $1.5 billion in 2021,ï¿½?said Norwood. âThis was a direct result of the US sanctions against the company and its parent company Huaweiï¿½?Norwood said. As per Norwood, this also impacted Chinaâs share of the semiconductor market as it declined from 6.7 per cent market share in 2020 to 6.5 per cent in 2021. South Korea witnessed the largest increase in market share in 2021 as strong growth in the memory market propelled South Korea to garner 19.3 per cent of the global semiconductor market. ï¿½?021 saw stronger demand return to the automotive and industrial markets compared to the weak, Covid-disrupted market in 2020,ï¿½?as per the report. The automotive semiconductor market grew 34.9 per cent in 2021 outperforming all other end markets. Wireless communications, which is dominated by smartphones, recorded a growth of 24.6 per cent. The number of 5G handsets produced reached 556 million in 2021, up from 251 million units in 2020, and enterprises upgraded their Wi-Fi infrastructure for employees heading back to the office. Driven by DRAM, memory accounted for 27.9 per cent of semiconductor sales in 2021 and experienced 33.2 per cent revenue growth, up $41.3 billion over the previous year. âMemory continued to benefit from the key demand trend in the last couple of years ï¿½?the shift to home/hybrid working and learning. This trend fueled increased server deployments by hyperscale cloud service providers to satisfy online working and entertainment, as well as a surge in end-market demand for PCs and ultramobiles,ï¿½?as per the report."

779,0,China Eyed In Hack of News Corp Journalists -- WSJ,2079 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"The attack, discovered on Jan. 20, affected a number of publications and business units including The Wall Street Journal and its parent Dow Jones; the New York Post; the company's U.K. news operation; and News Corp headquarters, according to an email the company sent to staff Friday.  News Corp said it notified law enforcement and hired cybersecurity firm Mandiant Inc. to support an investigation. A representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation said late Friday that it was aware of the incident. ""Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests,"" said David Wong, vice president of incident response at Mandiant.  News Corp disclosed the hack in a securities filing Friday, saying its preliminary analysis indicates that data was taken. A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said that China is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and ""firmly opposes and combats cyberattacks and cyber theft in all forms."" The spokesman, Liu Pengyu, said that identifying the source of cyberattacks is technically complex. ""We hope that there can be a professional, responsible and evidence-based approach to identifying cyber-related incidents, rather than making allegations based on speculations,"" Mr. Liu said.

""We are committed to protecting our journalists and sources. We will not be deterred from our purpose -- to provide uniquely trusted journalism and analysis.

The company's investigation indicates that systems housing financial and customer data, including subscriber information, weren't affected, according to the securities filing and a person familiar with the matter. The investigation detected that the intrusion appeared to date to at least February 2020, according to people briefed on the matter, and scores of employees were impacted. The hackers were able to access reporters' emails and Google Docs, including drafts of articles, the people said. News Corp was still trying to determine the full extent of emails and documents that were accessed, the people said. While the hackers accessed the Google system used by News Corp employees, there was no indication that they breached the system through a compromise at Google, said people briefed on the matter. Google's own systems weren't affected by the incident, a Google spokeswoman said. Reporters who were affected by the hack and were briefed on it expressed concerns to company officials about protecting their sources' identities. By Friday afternoon, many Journal reporters affected had been notified by company officials of specific documents that were believed to have been accessed. The attackers appeared to be interested in a range of topics, including issues of importance to Beijing such as Taiwan and China's Uyghur ethnic group, according to other people briefed on the matter and a review of some of the document target lists. Other areas of interest included draft Journal articles and notes about U.S. military troop activity, U.S. technology regulation related to China, and articles about President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and senior White House officials. The hackers also searched using keywords for emails related to traditional intelligence areas, including defense, one person familiar with the ongoing investigation said. Those searches in some cases appeared to be prompted by contemporary news developments. ""They would come back periodically,"" this person said. Law-enforcement officials and cybersecurity experts say that journalists are often high-priority targets for hackers seeking to gain intelligence on behalf of foreign governments, because they speak to sources who might have valuable or sensitive information. Powerful surveillance tools have been used against journalists and human-rights activists. U.S. authorities have accused China-based hackers for years of targeting a range of American businesses and government institutions. FBI Director Christopher Wray said this week that Beijing is running a ""massive, sophisticated hacking program that is bigger than those of every other major nation combined."" The FBI has more than 2,000 active investigations related to allegations of Chinese-government-directed theft of U.S. information or technology, Mr. Wray said. China has repeatedly denied allegations that it has carried out cyberattacks. In 2013, Chinese hackers trying to monitor news coverage of China hacked into the Journal's network, apparently aiming to spy on reporters covering China and other issues, the Journal reported. The New York Times had experienced a similar attack. At the time, a Chinese embassy spokesman condemned allegations of Chinese cyberspying and said Beijing prohibits cyberattacks. In February 2020, China revoked the press credentials of three Journal reporters based in Beijing. China's Foreign Ministry said the move was punishment for an opinion piece published by the Journal. The three journalists work for the Journal's news operation, which operates with a strict separation from the opinion staff. The following month, the Trump administration announced a personnel cap in the U.S. on four state-run Chinese media outlets. Later that March, China expelled from the country American journalists from multiple news organizations, including the Journal.

The attack, discovered on Jan. 20, affected a number of publications and business units including The Wall Street Journal and its parent Dow Jones; the New York Post; the company's U.K. news operation; and News Corp headquarters, according to an email the company sent to staff Friday.  News Corp said it notified law enforcement and hired cybersecurity firm Mandiant Inc. to support an investigation. A representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation said late Friday that it was aware of the incident. ""Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests,"" said David Wong, vice president of incident response at Mandiant.  News Corp disclosed the hack in a securities filing Friday, saying its preliminary analysis indicates that data was taken. A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said that China is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and ""firmly opposes and combats cyberattacks and cyber theft in all forms."" The spokesman, Liu Pengyu, said that identifying the source of cyberattacks is technically complex. ""We hope that there can be a professional, responsible and evidence-based approach to identifying cyber-related incidents, rather than making allegations based on speculations,"" Mr. Liu said. In the staff memo News Corp said it believes the threat activity is contained. The company has been offering guidance to affected employees.

Hit play on the player above to hear the podcast and follow along with the transcript below. This transcript was automatically generated, and then edited for clarity in its current form. There may be some differences between the audio and the text. Taylor Wilson: Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Wednesday the 9th of February, 2022. Today, the Supreme Court's shadow docket. Plus, a first gold medal for Team USA in Beijing, and more. Here are some of the top headlines: A New York couple has been arrested in an alleged scheme to launder billions of dollars in stolen Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin is related to the 2016 hack of a virtual currency exchange, though the couple are not currently linked to the hack itself. They're instead accused of laundering $3.6 billion in crypto. Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, criticized the Republican National Committee yesterday. He called out the RNC for censoring two Republicans on the majority Democrat committee that's investigating the 2021 Capitol attack. McConnell called it a violent insurrection. And the Academy Award nominations are here. Director, Jane Campion's The Power of the Dog leads with 12 nominations, including Best Picture. A Supreme Court ruling allowing Alabama's controversial congressional map to stand has exposed continued divisions among the justices. The issue, the practice of deciding major cases in a hurry on the court's so-called shadow docket. Producer, PJ Elliot sat down with Supreme Court Correspondent John Fritze to fill us in on what's going on. John Fritze: The Alabama Republican controlled legislature created congressional maps in which there was only one congressional district controlled by African Americans out of seven. And so, what advocates who are critical of that say is that, ""Look, it's a state that's 27% African American, and you're not representing that in the number of districts."" And that case has been litigated now for a while. And it came up to the Supreme Court over the past couple of weeks on the emergency docket, and the Supreme Court handed down a five-four ruling that basically said that those maps could remain in place. A lower court had said that the maps were problematic, that they probably violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act, that they probably diluted the Black vote in the State of Alabama. But the Supreme Court said, at least on a temporary basis, for now, that the maps could go forward, in part, because the election's right around the corner, the primary is coming up in May in that state, candidates have to announce and get qualified and get on the ballot. And the Supreme Court said, ""Look, there's not a lot of time. So, there really isn't time to redraw these maps."" And so, the Supreme Court allowed the maps to stay in place for at least the primary election. Practically, it's probably going to be in place for longer than that. PJ Elliot: So, can you explain what exactly a shadow docket is and how this applies to the Alabama ruling? John Fritze: So, usually, when the Supreme Court takes a case, it hears oral arguments, the parties file briefs, written arguments. That's a process that goes on for months and the justices look at it. The clerks look at it. There's sort of a full briefing that goes on where both sides have an opportunity to make their best case. And what's called the shadow docket by critics, or the emergency docket, none of that happens. There are briefs. They tend to be shorter. The timeline is much, much faster, its days as opposed to months. And there is no oral argument, usually. And the other thing that happens is that when we get the decision, it tends to be an unsigned opinion. So, we don't really know how the justices voted and it tends to be a lot less detailed about how they got to the position they got to. Now, supporters of this idea or people who defend it, including Justice Kavanaugh and his opinion in this case, says, ""Look, they're not deciding on the merits here. What they're deciding is whether to temporarily block the law or not. They're not striking down the law or upholding it. They are basically deciding whether it can stay in the short-term."" And so because of that, they need a way to do this quickly. Taylor Wilson: You can follow along with all of John Fritze's work with a link in today's episode description. Cyberattacks against the machinery that runs America are on the rise. Local governments are more vulnerable than ever before. And national cybersecurity officials are calling on America's mayors to form a frontline of defense. Domestic Security Correspondent, Josh Meyer, reports. Josh Meyer: Well, I think one of the reasons that local governments are more vulnerable is because they have some of the same targets that the federal government does. They both share a significant role in overseeing the critical infrastructure of the United States, which is roads, bridges, hospitals, anything that if it was taken down might threaten the security of the United States. But they don't have the resources, or the personnel, or the experience, to deal with the issues like the federal government does or the private sector. What's new here is that Jen Easterly, who's the head of CISA, which is the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Protection Agency, she's trying to get the mayors on board with a proactive response to this. CISA is an advisory agency only, even though it's the nation's newest security agency, they can't force governments to do anything. So, she's trying to convince them that they will, in the long run, save money and protect their citizens better if they do such things as require multifactor authentication, the same thing that most companies do, private companies do. When they give you a company laptop or a phone, you have to basically say that it's you and give them a text or some other code in order to guarantee that you're not some hacker in Russia who's trying to access their system. CISA also wants the mayors to take a lead role in ensuring that their municipalities back up their data and just take other basic steps that you and I might take for granted, or people that are fairly adept at cybersecurity. It's a long-term issue. It could take years or decades in order for this to happen. One of the things that's important and that's new is that the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA and other government agencies have been given a billion dollars in the most recent infrastructure bill, to spend. And so, CISA and the Department of Homeland Security, the director, Jen Easterly, they want to try to roll out as much as 200 million of that money this year, and then a total of a billion over the total four or five years, to help governments ramp up when it comes to this stuff. But it's going to take a long time. I mean, you have some municipalities that are forward thinking, so-called smart cities, where they're really trying to get a lot of technology infused into their systems, but you also have a lot of real mom-and-pop towns and cities around the country that have very antiquated systems in which they couldn't even really do much if they tried. They're going to have to replace a whole lot of equipment. They're going to have to really take a look at their whole systems. And one of the most important issues I keep hearing from cybersecurity officials and experts on the outside is the workforce issue, which means training people to have basically a clue as to what to do when it comes to cybersecurity. Don't click on that link that says, ""Free money, if you click this or download this app."" Or something like that. So, it's going to be a tough road to hoe, but they're trying to make a dent it. Taylor Wilson: You can follow along with Josh's work on Twitter @JoshMeyerDC, and check out some of his other recent work, like on the future of ISIS after the death of its leader. Well, we've all probably seen contactless payments at some point, in some form. You just tap your card or your phone at the register. And there's another payment method on the way. Apple yesterday announced a feature to pay by tapping your card or iPhone to another iPhone. Tech Reporter Brett Molina has more on the Talking Tech podcast. Brett Molina: We have seen this, you can pop out your credit card or your debit card, you have those three curvy lines that signify that you can tap to pay, or you have Apple Pay or Samsung Pay, or whatever payment app you have on your phone. And you just tap a terminal and you pay for what you need to. Soon, some merchants will support another way to pay, which is, instead of a terminal, you tap an iPhone. On Tuesday, Apple announced a new Tap to Pay feature that's coming soon to iPhones, where merchants can accept payments. And the way this works is, instead of needing equipment to support this tap to pay feature, the iPhone becomes the terminal. I write about this in a story that you can read on tech.usatoday.com. The way it's going to work is merchants that use Tap to Pay, are going to have an app specific to their iPhone. And then when a customer checks out, they can either hold their phone, Apple Watch, or their credit or debit card to the other iPhone to pay. So, it's really like a phone-to-phone type contact. It's really cool. It's going to support other third-party apps as well. So, there's a lot of different options here. It's going to roll out in Apple stores later this year, they're going to work with all the payment networks like Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express. Again, it's another really interesting, cool way to pay for stuff. Imagine you are at an outdoor market, I've seen this a lot at outdoor markets or places where it's primarily outdoors. And a lot of times they'll use maybe Square or another company's app, where you pay on the phone, right? They have a little swiper that's attached to the phone. You can just swipe on the little card reader, and then you pay that way. This sounds way more interesting, where it's literally just you're ready to pay. They hold their phone out. You put your phone on top, or you put your card on top, and you're paid and you're done. It sounds super useful. It sounds super helpful. And it's part of a much larger trend that we're seeing, of companies really pushing their way into contactless payment. Obviously, we've seen Samsung and Google with their own digital wallets and their own payment services that they offer, where you can pay with an app. And then of course, there's Amazon. They have a whole group of stores that is devoted to this cashier-less check, cashier-less tech, excuse me. And you never have to go to a cashier. Everything is just, you pay with an app and you're ready to go. Most recently, we saw Amazon unveil these new Go Stores. They're going to be focused in the suburbs. So again, you go to the store, there's nobody, a cashier there, there's no cashier present, and you go get your stuff and you're out the door. And especially now with the pandemic and everything going on there, it really feels like this way to pay has really taken off. And I think we're going to see a lot more of this. But again, this Tap to Pay option sounds like a really convenient, interesting way to pay, makes it a lot simpler. And I'm really curious how quickly we start seeing more of this in the different businesses we frequent. Taylor Wilson: You can find episodes of Talking Tech wherever you're listening right now. Gas prices continue to surge around the country. The national average for gas was 3.46 a gallon yesterday. That's up nearly a dollar from 2.47 last year. That means the average person is spending about $12 more to fill up a tank of gas in a medium sized car. According to the American Automobile Association, the reasons for higher prices are a mixed bag. There's increased demand for heating oil during the winter months. And there are recently worries that Russia could invade Ukraine. Any sanctions against Russia, based on their actions toward Ukraine, may cause it to withhold crude oil from the global market. Analysts also expect prices to continue to rise this year. Several price watchers have independently predicted $4 a gallon prices nationally by Memorial Day. Well, Team USA finally has a gold medal at these Beijing Winter Olympics. Lindsey Jacobellis won the women's snowboard cross. The 36-year-old is one of the most successful athletes in her sport, but many Americans remember her 2006 Olympic race in Torino, Italy, when she led the race late before falling on the last jump. In men's figure skating, Nathan Chen could add a gold for Team USA later today, after a record setting performance in the short program. And Chloe Kim has a chance to win gold in the women's snowboarding half-pipe final. She would be the first woman ever to win Olympic gold twice in the half-pipe.

508,0,G-20 meetings a ray of hope for Bali's beleaguered resort and conference centres,865 words,The Straits Times,"The meetings represent the biggest and best chance since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic for the island's resort and conference centres to steal a march on competition emerging in places like Thailand where quarantine standards have been relaxed in a bid to woo visitors. The wild card, though, remains the pandemic. The kick-off event in early December comprising senior officials from the finance ministries and central banks of G-20 members coincided with the onset of the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus. Only half of the 300 or so officials in attendance were foreign delegates. ""Flexibility will be crucial for us when it comes to the nation's success in being host of the G-20,"" said Mr Oriol Montal, general manager of Westin Resort Nusa Dua, which along with venues including the Bali Nusa Dua Convention Centre (BNDCC) will be where conferences and meetings will be held. Until the onset of the pandemic, the income from conventions and conference business was ballast for hotels and resorts, helping to steady income between the seasonal ups and downs of leisure traffic. Mr Montal said the Westin typically earned 30 per cent of its revenue from conferences and events. The G-20 meetings this year would help generate 33,000 jobs in Bali, the government has said. Also, establishing Bali as a trusted site for international conferences is a source of soft power for Indonesia. A decade ago, the government spent roughly 3.5 trillion rupiah to build the BNDCC - capable of hosting 10,000 people a stone's throw from the Westin - and a tollway linking the site with the island's international airport. Since then, the site in Nusa Dua has hosted climate, political and financial events including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund summit in 2018. This year marks the first time Indonesia has hosted the G-20. But the pandemic has sent some of those properties scrambling. Data is tough to come by but global spending on conferences by international associations, for example, shrunk last year to US$1.7 billion (S$2.3 billion) from nearly US$11 billion the year earlier as clients cancelled meetings or shifted them online, bypassing hotel stays, according to data from the International Congress and Convention Association. Mr Yoga Angga Muda, director of sales for BNDCC, said the convention centre was relying more on government contracts as it recovered from the sharp slowdown in business. ""During the recovery phase in 2022, we are focusing on the government sector with a slight pickup in business from the corporate sector,"" Mr Yoga told ST, adding that he foresaw a turnaround next year. ""In 2023, we already have business on hand from international association meetings."" More On This Topic Indonesia wants a more just world order as it kicks off year-long G-20 presidency Time for President Jokowi to show his global leadership as Indonesia hosts G-20 To be sure, containing the Omicron variant will not be easy. Expect smaller meetings overlaid with more safety protocols. In November, the Westin said it hosted 500 athletes, officials and referees attending the International Badminton Festival in something approaching a bubble. The event was sealed off from the wider public. For the G-20, the resort will make use of a premium hotel on its property that can also be sealed off from the public. Delegates arrive on charter flights and are whisked to the resort, hotel officials said, adding that their operating procedures will change with Covid-19 conditions. Still, Mr Montal is confident that despite the headaches that Covid-19 has caused, demand from clients to host in-person meetings is set to recover. ""I'm very optimistic about the second half of 2022,"" he said. ""Face-to-face meetings are coming back.""

President Joko Widodo said in Rome last November upon assuming the presidency of the grouping from Italy: ""We will host your excellencies in the open air, on the beautiful stretch of Bali beaches, which inspires innovative ideas for the productivity of G-20 in the future.

936,1,Important Amendments To The Encouragement Of Capital Investments Law,1302 words,Mondaq Business Briefing,"As we shall see in this article, the main goal of the said amendments was to encourage manufacturers and industrialists, both local and foreign, to set up factories in Israel instead of abroad, a global trend of many countries that is becoming more prevalent lately around the world, particularly since the beginning of the presidency of Donald Trump, who seeks to encourage many American companies to return and re-open production factories in the United States. Introduction: As stated above, the purpose of the law is a dual purpose; both to promote Israel in the âtax competitionï¿½?with other countries and to encourage businesses in the peripheral areas of Israel. The law and the regulations installed by virtue of it, effectively determine two kinds of incentives1: Incentives whose main purpose is to increase economic growth, which aim at increasing investments in the economy as a whole. Incentives whose main purpose is the development of the periphery, in such way that these are intended to influence the spreading of the industry throughout Israel and increase activity and investments in the periphery. The benefits included in the Law are granted when there is an establishment or expansion of an industrial factory or a tourist enterprise in two tracks - the grants track and the tax benefits track. Important amendments to the law in recent years: Two major amendments to the law have been approved in recent years, dramatically affecting it. The first and major one is Amendment 68 of 2012, which we will elaborate on below. The second, which will not be discussed in this article, is Amendment 73 of 2017, which relates mainly to income from intangible assets. In parenthesis, we shall add that in the past few days, the Israli tax authority has updated its policy to include the stipulations of the Law also on startup companies. Until Amendment 68, the law placed an emphasis on attracting capital to Israel and encouraging economic initiatives and foreign capital and local capital investment, inter alia, in order to develop the production capacity of the country's economy, improve the country's balance of payments and absorption of immigrants. Within Amendment 68 to the Law, it was decided to provide a more comprehensive and appropriate answer to the economic challenges that the Israeli economy faces in general, and the industrial sector in particular. Therefore, the purpose of the law was changed so that the emphasis was placed on innovation and activity in development areas, to develop the economy's production capacity, improve the competitiveness of the business sector in international markets and create more work places. The Amendment changed both the tax benefits track and the grants track. For example, as part of the grants track, the mechanism regarding grants in the industry was extended also to investments in non-physical capital, with the purpose of expanding the mechanism to other areas that could develop the industry, such as the training and development of workers. As part of the tax benefits track, prior to the Amendment, the Law established a complex benefits mechanism, which often created uncertainty amongst investors with respect to the tax rates they had to pay in practice, and therefore, could significantly harm Israel's ability to attract investments to the industry. Under Amendment 68, an extensive change was made in Article 51 of the Law, by adding mark B1 and- B2 of Chapter VII of the Law, under which the tax benefits mechanisms for a âpreferred companyï¿½?that is the owner of a âpreferred factoryï¿½?were founded, as well as tax benefits mechanisms for a âpreferred companyï¿½?that is the owner of a âSpecial preferred factoryï¿½? More specifically, we shall note briefly that a âpreferred companyï¿½?(a company incorporated in Israel, which is not fully owned by the government and which meets a number of cumulative conditions provided by law), which owns a âpreferred factoryï¿½?(an industrial factory which meets the terms of âcompetitive factoryï¿½?that are listed in Article 81A of the Law) and has âpreferred incomeï¿½?(income that is derived from the Israeli activity of the preferred factory) will be entitled to a preferred tax rate on the total preferred income of the preferred factory. Therefore, as of 2015 onwards, preferred factories could benefit from a reduced tax rate of 6% in development areas A (as defined in the Second Addition to the Law) and 12% in areas which are not development areas A. These tax rates are much lower than those that prevailed prior to Amendment 68. In addition, Amendment 68 set out additional tax benefits, inter alia for âspecial preferred factoryï¿½?(as defined by law), in distributing dividends and by accelerated depreciation. As described below, the objectives of the new law are in line with the prevailing trend around the world in recent years, as can be seen in the American economy. The Amendments to the Law in Light of the Prevailing Global Trend: As noted above, the change in the purposes of the law was such that the emphasis was given to developing the economy's production capacity, improving the competitiveness of the business sector in international markets and creating more work places. The common denominator of these goals is actually strengthening local production rather than production in foreign countries that are considered cheaper for such activity (such as China, Turkey, etc.). This trend is not unique to the Israeli economy but is becoming increasingly common among other countries around the world. For example, in the United States, President Trump tries to create work places and strengthen local production by imposing taxes on imported goods from China. In contrast to the approach adopted in Israel, i.e. the granting of tax benefits and grants to encourage production and reduce costs, in the United States, in light of the difficulty to make production considerably cheaper and affordable, Trump chose to impose restrictions (in the form of taxes) which will make production in other countries more expensive. It may not be the same method, but the final goal is identical- encouraging the local production industry and creating new work places. Conclusion: Thus, in recent years, it is more beneficial for local industrialists and manufacturers to receive the benefits and grants granted by the Encouragement of Capital Investments Law, and to set up their factories in Israel. By exploiting the mechanisms that are established by Law, manufacturers have the potential to increase their profits while making a significant contribution to the Israeli economy's production capacity, improving the competitiveness of the business sector in international markets, and creating work places in the periphery. It is a win-win situation in every aspect. Footnote 1. Income Tax Notification no. 3/2012 of the ISA, dated 10.6.2012.

91,1,Growing challenges in food supply chains,2166 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"You may be interested in: #Data : Food inflation in Mexico, the fifth highest in the world. The CPI of the Minimum Consumption Basket that tracks price variations of 176 products and services contained in the Coneval Food Baskets also shows a significant growth of 7.86% in February 2022 versus one of 4.55% in 2021, i.e. almost double. As for prices paid to producers, according to Inegi, the National Producer Price Index (INPP) registered an inflation of 9.83% in February 2022 versus the same month in 2021. For Primary Activities it was 15.12%, for the Food Industry it was 13.34% and for the Beverage and Tobacco Industry it was 6.18%. In general, the inflation levels recorded are well above the Bank of Mexico's target of 3%, +/- 1%, and in the case of the agri-food sector, this behavior is even more notable. The inflationary phenomenon currently registered in the agrifood sector is linked to several external factors with which our country is linked because it is a free market economy, and which have a direct impact on local prices; these factors are detailed below, as well as some internal factors that have had an impact on our country's agrifood markets: Agricultural CommoditiesAccording to the FAO Price Index the average price of food in December 2021 was 23.1% higher than 2020, ranging from a 17.1% increase in meat products to a 36.1% increase in vegetable oils. Finance As of February this year, food prices recorded a monthly increase of 3.7% (versus January 2022), while compared to December 2021 the increase was 5.0%. In this same comparison, the 13% increase in the price of vegetable oils and 9.4% in dairy products stand out. Considering that Mexico is a major world importer of commodities (e.g. grains, oilseeds, meat and dairy products) and with a growing trend in the volumes purchased abroad, whatever happens with international commodity prices has a direct impact on food prices in our country. The increase in international prices of feed grains and oilseeds, as the main input in livestock production, is also having an impact on production costs, which in turn is affecting the prices of livestock products. Oil In 2021, according to the World Bank, the average price of Brent crude oil reached US$70.5/barrel, 66.6% higher than in 2020 (US$42.3/barrel), while the February price this year is 37.3% higher than the corresponding price in 2021. As for oil futures, they have been volatile since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24 and are trading as high as 113 (dollars/barrel) for May (as of March 30). Natural gasIn 2021, U.S. natural gas averaged a price of $3.85 per million British thermal units (mmbtu), up 91.5% compared to $2.01/mmbtu in 2020, while its February price this year represents a 21.04% increase compared to the average in 2021. Gas futures with delivery for the month of May 2022 stand at US$5.61/mmbtu (as of March 30), showing further upward pressure. FertilizersIn 2021, world fertilizer prices rose sharply due to issues related to the behavior of energy prices (e.g. natural gas, a basic input for the production of nitrogen-based fertilizers), as well as to logistics due to higher international freight costs and delays in shipments, while the conflict in Ukraine and Russia have led estimates to point to further increases in 2022. In 2021, world fertilizer prices increased by more than 100% to levels not recorded since the financial crisis of 2008-09, while as of February 2022, prices are still above the average recorded in 2021 by 24-54% and continue to be under upward pressure, after Russia, the world's leading fertilizer producer and the main supplier of this input to Mexico, has stopped its sea freight, causing a shortage in the market. Alterations in logisticsDisruptions in the transportation and distribution of goods is a problem that affects global supply chains alike, which continue to be severely affected by the events of the last two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Transportation costs, particularly maritime, have skyrocketed and, unlike the oil-based supply shock of the 1970s, supply shocks from the pandemic have been more diverse and uncertain. Among the impacts the pandemic had on logistics since its onset in 2019 was the high demand for containers and container ships. The Container Freight Index for the ports of China and Shanghai, two of the world's leading ports, increased by 89.2% and 186.3%, respectively, in January 2021 versus the same month in 2020, and although so far in 2022, there has been a decrease in cargo values, they are still very high, almost double, compared to the levels recorded at the beginning of 2021. The high demand for containers also caused freight rates to rise significantly, with increases of up to 886% for China, 567% for Europe, 567% for Southeast Asia and 507% for Latin America. In addition, the saturation of some ports and the prohibition of berthing ships in others led to a considerable increase in transit times. According to the Reliability Index of transit time in maritime transport for 34 companies, from levels in the order of 70-80%, this was reduced from mid-2020 to reach levels close to 30% in 2021, the lowest level recorded in the last ten years. War conflict Russia's invasion of Ukraine is putting pressure on global supply chains. A significant portion of the world's grains, especially wheat, corn and barley, are being held up in Russia and Ukraine because of the war, while an even larger portion of the world's fertilizer has not been shipped from the world's leading exporter, Russia. The result is that food prices are rising, as well as world fertilizer prices. Russia is a major producer and exporter of natural gas and fertilizer, providing 23% of the world's ammonia, 17% of potassium, 14% of urea and 10% of phosphates, so supply disruptions could cause prices to rise from levels that are already very high, affecting the world's food prices, This would affect countries that depend on imports of this input, such as our country, which only produces 40% of its fertilizer requirements, importing around five million tons, while Russia is its main supplier with around 30%. Climatological phenomenaIt is important not to overlook the effects of climate change, which are increasingly recurrent and evident: storms, cyclones, floods, fires, among others, which have a direct impact on the activities of the agrifood sector. The ""La NiÃ±a"" phenomenon, associated with below-normal rainfall, has been one of the phenomena that has most affected agricultural yields recently, mainly in the Southern Cone in Argentina and Brazil, both in spring and summer, as these countries are major producers and exporters of food in the world. Finances The presence of the ""La NiÃ±a"" phenomenon has also been a recurring event in recent years in the North American region, including Mexico and the United States, which has had an impact on crop productivity and therefore on production. The impact of the drought in the North American region as of 2019 also affected the availability of pasture, and consequently the livestock herd. In addition, this phenomenon has an impact on the markets, projecting higher prices due to expectations of lower production volumes for commodities. In 2020 there was a severe drought in Mexico, which still had a significant impact in the first half of 2021; as the rainy season normalized, this problem was attenuated; however, forecasts point to the occurrence of the ""La NiÃ±a"" phenomenon again this year, associated with a dry climate in the north of the country. This climatic context has had a major impact on the production of basic grains and livestock feed, such as alfalfa. Seasonality in productionIn addition to all of the above factors, the primary sector, which is the basic link in the food production chains, has a natural seasonality phenomenon in production, particularly in the case of fruits and vegetables, which has a direct impact on availability and prices in the domestic market. Thus, in Mexico, the upward behavior of fruit and vegetable prices is mainly due to seasonality, which is observed annually for most products, and which is sometimes also affected by adverse weather factors that reduce yields and therefore production. Therefore, the combination of a normal season, of low production, with the presence of weather problems is reflected in even lower availability of product. There are also times of the year when demand increases due to consumption and this also has an impact on prices. For example, in the case of lemons, although this fruit is produced practically all year round, according to the seasonality of the harvest, its production cycle concludes in the last quarter of the year, while its lowest production season is from January to May (28% of the total), which usually has an impact on prices. Other fruit, such as avocado, which is also produced throughout the year, is entering the period of lower harvest volumes corresponding to the second quarter of the year. In addition, horticultural products are currently at the time of the year with the highest export volumes for the autumn-winter harvest in the northwest region of the country, a factor that also generates upward pressure on prices. This, together with the fact that fruit and vegetable export volumes have been growing, generates less availability of product for the domestic market, which also puts upward pressure on prices. Insecurity, another factor In some areas of the country the issue of insecurity is also a factor that has an influence on production, logistics and prices of some products, it is noted in some cases that there are abandonment of crops for fear of actions that may threaten people or their property, there are issues of extortion, theft of goods that are affecting the normal flow and increases in production costs of some goods. Taking actionAt a time when inflation and war threaten food chains, the FAO has recommended that countries that depend on food imports should seek alternative suppliers to cushion shocks, in addition to taking advantage of existing food inventories and diversifying their domestic production to ensure access to food for the population. Finance Support for producers at this juncture is crucial; effective public policies are needed to support productivity, creating conditions that will enable supply chain actors to be resilient to these types of situations that undermine their productive capacity. It is necessary to implement productive development programs that encourage activities and reduce production costs, expand the provision of financing under better conditions for farmers, support and promote greater use of risk management tools and, in general, create the conditions that will enable them to respond quickly and effectively to any type of risk. It is essential to carry out a deep analysis between the Government and the productive sectors in order to implement the necessary actions, first to guarantee the food supply and supply in this case, and on the other hand, to alleviate the impacts of this international inflationary crisis that is also affecting our country and our population. Final reflectionAt a time when the food supply chains were beginning to recover from the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and we had boasted that its impact on food supply had been minor, a generalized increase in inflation at the world level occurred, as a result of increases in the prices of commodities and basic services at the international level, to which pressures have been added due to the conflict in Ukraine linked to disruptions in the availability of large volumes of basic grains and fertilizers, which is causing further increases in food prices. ??

This is affecting all links in the production chain, making it necessary to formulate policy responses to help overcome these challenges that put farmers' productivity and production at risk, while consumers face lower food availability and higher prices."

522,1,Call for youngsters in care jobs Career in care sector challenges,371 words,Kent Messenger,"It comes as the government unveils a 10-year vision for major reforms to adult social care across England. Chris McKenzie, KCCâs director of adult social care, said there is a shortfall in the take up of social care jobs in Kent. He said: âOne of the challenges we are facing is we are competing with sectors we have not traditionally had to compete with, like hospitality and retail. âIt canât just be about money and what we offer in terms of financial reward. âThis is about selling the positive benefits of working in the sector and what it gives people in terms of meaning in their chosen profession. It is an incredibly rewarding career. There are opportunities to progress in different routes.ï¿½?His comments were made during a public meeting yesterday in County Hall, Maidstone. Ministers are seeking to provide more opportunities for the care workforce to develop their careers. Personal care costs will be capped at Â£86,000 from October 2023.Â The aim is to reduce the amount anyone will need to spend on care over their lifetime. Councils, like KCC, will be expected to deliver the changes at a local level. Meanwhile, schools like Wilmington Academy are running education modulesÂ on health and social care through the English Baccalaureate. Dartford East county councillor Penny Cole (Con), who is KCCâs deputy cabinet member for adult social care, said: âIn Kent, we need to talk about this in a more positive way and promote it as a really good career option.ï¿½?Cllr Cole said: âI hope they feel it is really valuable and worth staying in. âThe pay is important, but the future options of their pathway is equally important.ï¿½?Mr McKenzie added: âWe have to be more innovative and imaginative with the sorts of approaches that we look to take forward.ï¿½?All county councillors will be briefedÂ on the proposed changes in due course."

662,1,NRF - March Retail Sales Grew Despite Higher Inflation,841 words,U.S. Political and Economic Organizations News via PUBT,"For immediate release April 14, 2022  press@nrf.com [mailto:press@nrf.com]  (855) NRF-PRESS  J. Craig Shearman  ""We believe the strength of the consumer can carry the economy through this considerable economic uncertainty.""  NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay  WASHINGTON - Retail sales grew in March even as inflation edged higher, the National Retail Federation said today. ""March retail sales show that consumers have maintained their ability to spend in the face of record-level inflation, supply chain issues and geopolitical unrest,"" NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said. ""Consumers are adapting and shopping smarter for themselves and their families. We believe the strength of the consumer can carry the economy through this considerable economic uncertainty if policymakers implement measured policies and do not overreact to current conditions."" ""While prices soared in March and eroded spending power, shoppers remained resilient and sales were healthy,"" NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said. ""Consumers have the willingness to spend and their ability to do so has been supported by rapid hiring, increased wages, larger-than-usual tax refunds and the use of credit. They are largely dealing with the shock of gas prices but will be facing higher interest rates as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy in the coming months. The challenge for the Fed is to cool off demand without pushing the economy into a dramatic slowdown."" The U.S. Census Bureau [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.nyu.edu/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf] today said overall retail sales in March were up 0.5 percent seasonally adjusted from February and up 6.9 percent year over year. That compared with increases of 0.8 percent month over month and 18.2 percent year over year in February. Despite occasional month-over-month declines, sales have grown year over year every month since May 2020, according to Census data.  NRF's calculation of retail sales - which excludes automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants to focus on core retail - showed March was unchanged seasonally adjusted from February but up 4 percent unadjusted year over year. In February, sales were down 0.7 percent month over month but up 13.2 percent year over year.  NRF's numbers were up 8.6 percent unadjusted year over year on a three-month moving average as of March.

240,0,MORE BUMS IN BEDS,796 words,The Financial Mail,"Anumber of new hotels are opening in SA this year ï¿½?which seems to defy logic, given that the hospitality industry has been crippled by lockdowns, international travel restrictions and lingering uncertainty of how the pandemic will play out. However, some industry players believe adding new room capacity in certain nodes is justified on the back of what they believe could be a faster recovery to pre-Covid trading levels than widely expected. The latest data from global hospitality analytics company STR supports the notion, with SA hotels recording a relatively robust set of trading metrics in January. Occupancy as well as revenue per available room (revpar) practically doubled year on year ï¿½?from 20.7% to 40.4% and R232.05 to R540.25 (see graph). Yes, thatâs still some way off the average SA occupancy of 56.5% and revpar of R823.21 reached in January 2020. But it points to an encouraging uptick in demand, especially as foreign tourists havenât yet returned to SA in large numbers. & February has been an even better month than January,& says Gary Koetser, joint CEO of Century City Conference Centre and Hotels, which opened its new 98-room Bridgewater Hotel at the mixed-use precinct near Milnerton, Cape Town, in December. The hotel overlooks a 6ha parkland of islands and waterways. It primarily targets business travellers and brings Century Cityâs hospitality offering to five hotels with a total room tally of 650. All this is within walking distance of Century Cityâs 800-seater conference centre. Koetser notes that Bridgewater reached an occupancy of 78% in February, mostly due to a strong recovery in the meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions market. He ascribes the & rapid rate& at which the precinctâs conferencing business has rebounded in recent weeks to pent-up demand among local companies that are desperate to get staff together again in person. Thatâs especially true for industries with a large component of sales representatives. & You canât network, build corporate culture or motivate salespeople on a PC screen,& he says. & So local corporates that put conferences on hold that were planned pre-Covid are now starting to pull the trigger.& He also expects international business and leisure tourism to pick up in the next few months, depending on how a potential fifth wave of Covid will disrupt the world. He refers to US carrier United Airlines recently announcing plans to resume direct flights between New York and Cape Town in June. In addition, Delta Airlines is looking to introduce direct flights between Atlanta and Cape Town in November. Other industry players seem equally bullish about the recovery of SAâs hospitality industry. Radisson Hotel Group, for example, will open two new hotels this year: Radisson Safari Hotel Hoedspruit near Kruger National Park, the groupâs first safari-inspired hotel in SA; and Radisson Blu Oceans Umhlanga Hotel, its first hotel in Durban. That will expand Radissonâs SA footprint to 15 properties. Tim Cordon, Radissonâs senior area vice-president for the Middle East & Africa, says the expansion of its SA operations underscores the groupâs positive growth expectations for 2022. The group plans to add 400 new hotels across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia this year to its portfolio, which spans more than 1,600 hotels in 120 countries. However, FNB property strategist John Loos says while thereâs no doubt that SAâs hotel sector is starting to claw its way out of the & deep hole& created by Covid lockdowns, hotel revenues are unlikely to return to 2019 levels just yet, especially not in real (inflation-adjusted) terms. He cites a number of reasons for this, among others that many people may not yet be willing to resume international travel this year. He adds that domestic leisure tourism may also remain constrained for now as South Africans are under pressure financially, due to the effect of the 2020 recession on employment and incomes. & With holiday tourism being nonessential in nature, this expenditure category may get put on the back burner for many households while they nurse their finances back to health,& he says. And while itâs picking up, local business travel is also unlikely to recover to pre-Covid levels this year, given how many companies have & zoomified& interaction with employees and clients. Loos says much of the costly physical business travel may never return. & Many hotels may have to be less dependent on domestic business travel on a more permanent basis.& Century City Hotel Bridgewater: Targets primarily business travellers"

Then, this week, an excellent feature article[https://www-science-org.proxy.library.nyu.edu/content/article/studying-fighting-misinformation-top-scientific-priority-biologist-argues] on the study of misinformation appeared in Science, by the reporter Kai Kupferschmidt[https://www-science-org.proxy.library.nyu.edu/content/author/kai-kupferschmidt]. Buried halfway through was an intriguing tidbit: The MIT study had failed to account for a bias in its selection of news stories, the article claimed. When different researchers reanalyzed the data last year, controlling for that bias, they found no effectââthe difference between the speed and reach of false news and true news disappeared.ï¿½?So the landmark paper had been ï¿½?completely wrong?

Written by Jonas Juul, of Cornell University, and Johan Ugander, of Stanford, and published in November 2021, it has accumulated just six citations in the research literature. Altmetrics suggests that it was covered by six news outlets, while not a single Wikipedia article or U.S. patent has referenced its findings. In other words, Vosoughi et al.âs fake news about fake news had traveled much further, deeper, and more quickly than the truth. This was just the sort of thing I love: The science of misinformation is rife with mind-bending anecdotes[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-will-debunk-the-debunkers/] in which a major theory of âpost-truthï¿½?gets struck down by better data[https://slate.com/health-and-science/2018/01/weve-been-told-were-living-in-a-post-truth-age-dont-believe-it.html], then draws a last, ironic breath. In 2016, when a pair of young political scientists wrote a paper that cast doubt on the âbackfire effect[https://papers-ssrn-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2819073],ï¿½?which claims that correcting falsehoods only makes them stronger, at first they couldnât get it published.

And here we were again. âI love this so much,ï¿½?I wrote on Twitter on Thursday morning, above a screenshot of the Science story. I love this so much: Remember the Science paper showing that misinformation travels farther and faster on social media than the truth? It was wrong!

I donât speak German or Italian, but I could tell Iâd struck a nerve. Retweets and likes gathered by the hundreds. But then, wait a secondâI was wrong. Within a few hours of my post, Kupferschmidt tweeted that heâd made a mistake[https://twitter.com/kakape/status/1507018418087600132]. Later in the afternoon, he wrote a careful mea culpa[https://twitter.com/kakape/status/1507101467563511808] and Science issued a correction. It seemed that Kupferschmidt had misinterpreted the work from Juul and Ugander: As a matter of fact, the MIT study hadnât been debunked at all. By the time I spoke to Juul on Thursday night, I knew I owed him an apology. Heâd only just logged onto Twitter and seen the pileup of lies about his work. âSomething similar happened when we first published the paper,ï¿½?he told me. Mistakes[https://www.newswise.com/articles/viral-true-tweets-spread-just-as-far-as-viral-untrue-tweets] were madeâeven by fellow scientists[https://twitter.com/GordPennycook/status/1458431976348717061]. Indeed, every time he gives a talk about it, he has to disabuse listeners of the same false inference. âIt happens almost every time that I present the results,ï¿½?he told me. Absolute classic. That study everyone cited with righteous glee, that misinformation spreads faster than true information, was in fact misinformation https://t.co/UqzzktIhJj[https://t.co/UqzzktIhJj]  ï¿½?Medlife Crisis (Rohin) (@MedCrisis) March 24, 2022[https://twitter.com/MedCrisis/status/1507096191540121610?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]He walked me through the paperâs findingsâwhat it really said. First off, when he reproduced the work from the team at MIT, using the same data set, heâd found the same result: Fake news did reach more people than the truth, on average, and it did so while spreading deeper, faster and more broadly through layers of connections. But Juul figured these four qualitiesâfurther, faster, deeper, broaderâmight not really be distinct: Maybe fake news is simply more âinfectiousï¿½?than the truth, meaning that each person who sees a fake-news story is more likely to share it. As a result, more infectious stories would tend to make their way to more people overall. That greater reachâthe further qualityâseemed fundamental, from Juulâs perspective. The other qualities that the MIT paper had attributed to fake newsâits faster, deeper, broader movement through Twitterâmight simply be an outgrowth of this more basic fact. So Juul and Ugander reanalyzed the data, this time controlling for each news storyâs total reachâand, voilÃ¡, they were right. So fake news does spread further than the truth, according to Juul and Uganderâs study; but the other ways in which it moves across the network look the same. What does that mean in practice? First and foremost, you canât identify a simple fingerprint for lies on social media and teach a computer to identify it. (Some researchers have tried[https://arxiv-org.proxy.library.nyu.edu/pdf/2002.00850.pdf] and failed to build these sorts of automated fact-checkers, based on the work from MIT.) But if Juulâs paper has been misunderstood, he told me, so, too, was the study that it reexamined. The Vosoughi et al. paper arrived in March 2018, at a moment when its dire warnings matched the public mood. Three weeks earlier, the Justice Department had indicted 13 Russians[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/us/politics/russians-indicted-mueller-election-interference.html] and three organizations for waging âinformation warfareâ[https://www-justice-gov.proxy.library.nyu.edu/file/1035477/download] against the U.S. Less than two weeks later, The Guardian and The New York Times published stories about the leak of more than 50 million Facebook usersâ[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html#click=https://t.co/UAg1Q5t1BG] private data to Cambridge Analytica. Fake news was a foreign plot. Fake news elected Donald Trump. Fake news infected all of our social networks. Fake news was now a superbug, and here, from MIT, was scientific proof. As this hyped-up coverage multiplied, Deb Roy, one of the studyâs co-authors, tweeted a warning that the scope of his research had been âover-interpreted[https://twitter.com/dkroy/status/974251282071474177].ï¿½?The findings applied most clearly to a very small subset of fake-news stories on Twitter, he said: Those that had been deemed worthy of a formal fact-check, and which had been adjudicated as false by six specific fact-checking organizations. Yet much of the coverage assumed that the same conclusions could reliably be drawn about all fake news. But Royâs message didnât do that much to stop the spread of that exaggeration. Hereâs a quote from The Guardian[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/audio/2018/mar/16/fake-news-is-twitters-flu-chips-with-everything-podcast] the very next day: âLies spread six times faster than the truth on Twitter.ï¿½?Now, with signs that Russia may be losing its latest information war[https://www-theatlantic-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/technology/archive/2022/03/russia-ukraine-war-propaganda/626975/?utm_source=feed], perhaps psychic needs have changed. Misinformation is still a mortal threat, but U.S. news consumers may be past the peak of fake-news panic. We may even have an appetite for scientific âproofï¿½?that all those fake-news fears were unfounded. When I told Juul that I was sorry for my tweet, he responded with a gracious scoff. âItâs completely human,ï¿½?he said. The science is the science, and the truth can only go so far. In just the time that weâd been talking, my false post about his work had been shared another 28 times."

About 80 per cent of the Japanese population have received two vaccine shots, but only 1 per cent the booster. The government has promised to speed up boosters, but most people wonât be getting them until after March or later, under the current schedule.The third dose is recommended particularly against omicron, which is causing more breakthrough infections than early forms of the virus. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is keen on avoiding public discontent of its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, widely seen as behind the ouster of the previous prime minister.Nationwide parliamentary elections will be held in a few months.Bars and eateries that abide by the government restrictions are eligible for aid. But some say that hasnât been enough. More than 20,000 new cases were reported Monday nationwide, showing cases are rising quickly because of omicron. Most experts think the case tally is an undercount because testing is not widespread. Some 134,000 people are now quarantining or hospitalised for COVID-19.About 18,400 people have died from COVID-19.

The letters were sent weeks after Frontier Software told Nine Entertainment Co, owner of this masthead, that about 500 current and former employees had their personal payroll details stolen. Frontier initially told Nine Radio, which runs 2GB, 3AW and 4BC, that no personal information of its employees had been released, but changed its view after further analysis. The data accessed included full names, home and email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, tax file numbers, salaries, payroll IDs and superannuation fund details. Sky News said the details could include full names and bank account numbers. Sky News no longer uses Frontier as its payroll provider. Research from McGrath Nicol late last year showed ransomware attacks are becoming a big problem for Australian executives, with 35 per cent of companies having suffered a ransomware attack and 83 per cent of those businesses paying a ransom. The use of ransomware on Australian business led to the creation of a new taskforce by the Australian Federal Police, which allows it to more effectively fight crime groups within Australia and overseas. The federal government last year announced a ransomware action plan with more funding for security officials to go after criminal gangs. It also introduced legislation that requires companies hit by ransomware to report to the Australian Cyber Security Centre."

245,0,"Starbucks Is Moving to Oust Workers in Buffalo, Union Supporters Say",1363 words,NYTimes.com Feed,"At least five of the cases have arisen at a store that unionized in December, though union supporters at other Buffalo-area stores report similar conversations with managers, frequently but not always involving pro-union employees. The company denies any connection between the scheduling issues and union activities and says the matter is strictly logistical. The tensions indicate how labor relations are playing out after initial successes in unionizing company stores. None of Starbucksâs roughly 9,000 corporate-owned stores in the United States were unionized before early December, but three have unionized since then, and workers at more than 100 stores across the country have filed for union elections. One of the Buffalo workers, Cassie Fleischer, said her manager told her on Feb. 20 that she would soon no longer be employed at the store where she had worked since 2020 because she had sought to reduce her hours from around 30 to 15, a change the manager said she could not accommodate. The store was recently unionized, and Ms. Fleischer is a prominent union supporter. Kellen Montanye, who works at the same store, said the manager told him in a meeting Sunday that he would have to decide this week if he could increase his availability to 15 or 20 hours or leave the company. Mr. Montanye was also outspoken in supporting the union. âThis new policy is a complete betrayal of the promise made by Starbucks to its partners, to schedule us around our other jobs or our school hours,ï¿½?Starbucks Workers United, the union representing the workers, said in a statement, using the companyâs term for its employees. âThis is a part of Starbucksâs broader strategy to bust our union.ï¿½?News that the company was asking some employees to be available to work more hours or leave was reported[https://perfectunion.us/starbucks-attempting-to-force-out-union-leaders-at-buffalo-stores/] earlier by the labor-oriented website More Perfect Union. Reggie Borges, a Starbucks spokesman, said that the company was not firing the workers and that there was no policy requiring minimum availability. The company generally tries to honor employeesï¿½?preferences on availability, he said, but it cannot guarantee that it will do so, especially when several employees request more limited availability around the same time. Mr. Borges said that 10 people at Ms. Fleischerâs and Mr. Montanyeâs store, on Elmwood Avenue in Buffalo, had made such requests recently, out of a total of about 27 workers there. Union supporters said they had not previously faced resistance when making such requests. Many union supporters were also skeptical that 10 workers at the Elmwood store had asked to scale back their hours in ways that posed an unusual challenge for management. A recording of a meeting between Ms. Fleischer and her manager, provided to a reporter by the union, seemed to indicate that the number was lower. âThereâs your shift and a couple other people that really, with the hours that I ï¿½?I just, I donât have the quite the availability,ï¿½?the manager told Ms. Fleischer. If fewer workers had sought significant reductions in availability, that would presumably be easier to accommodate. The manager appeared to acknowledge in the recording that the refusal to grant the reduction in hours was a break with her previous approach. âThereâs certain things that I have to take care of as well, that maybe I didnât do the right way before, but I have to get on board,ï¿½?the manager said. Mr. Montanye, a graduate student at the University at Buffalo, said that he had worked at Starbucks since 2018 and at the Elmwood store for roughly one year, and that he had frequently adjusted his hours. He said he typically worked nearly full time during winter and summer breaks and only one or two days a week while school was in session. His managers had never taken issue with these requests, he added. But at an initial meeting on Feb. 13, he said, his manager told him that his current schedule of one day a week no longer met the storeâs âneedsï¿½?and that he would have to provide 15 or 20 hours of weekly availability to stay on the schedule. At a follow-up meeting over the weekend, he said, the manager told him to decide this week whether he could provide the additional availability. He may seek a leave of absence instead. Ms. Fleischer had worked at Starbucks for over four years, and at the Elmwood store since the summer of 2020. She was typically scheduled for about 33 or 34 hours a week during the second half of last year. But she began looking for additional work elsewhere to cover expenses after her scheduled hours dropped somewhat in January. She asked to scale back to 15 hours a week upon finding a second job, at which point her manager told her in an initial meeting in early February that the more limited availability didnât meet the âneeds of the business,ï¿½?according to Ms. Fleischer. In her final meeting with her manager, which Ms. Fleischer recorded on Feb. 20, the manager said that she had not put Ms. Fleischer on the schedule for the next two weeks and that, after a certain number of weeks of being unscheduled, Ms. Fleischer would be âtermed outï¿½?ï¿½?that is, no longer employed by Starbucks. She is scheduled to meet with her district manager to discuss the issue on Mar. 7. Ms. Fleischer said she would have been unlikely to look for a second job had her hours not dropped in January. Hours at Starbucks tend to fall somewhat during the slow months of January and February, but Ms. Fleischer and Mr. Montanye said they believed the changes were also driven by the addition of several new workers to the store in the fall. The union has said the fall hiring was intended to dilute union support ahead of an election at the store; the company has said the hiring was intended to address understaffing. Mr. Borges said that a similar number of workers had left the store since then and that hours had been fairly consistent. An employee at another Starbucks in Buffalo, Roisin Doherty, said her store also cut back her hours. In late January she too took another job, then informed her manager that she would need to change her availability to weekends only. Screenshots provided by Ms. Doherty show that the manager congratulated her through a messaging app and did not indicate that the new constraints would be a problem. But in early February the manager wrote that she would need âat least four daysï¿½?of availability. Workers at her store filed for a union election in between the two exchanges, on Jan. 31, and Ms. Doherty has helped lead the union campaign, though she said another worker who is not identified with the union had also been told that his availability was insufficient. Ms. Doherty said that she remained on the schedule and that she had yet to have a second interaction with a manager forcing the issue. Mr. Borges, the Starbucks spokesman, said Ms. Dohertyâs hours were reduced after she was given a written warning about tardiness and attendance issues. He said managers would continue contacting employees when necessary to explain that narrow availability could lead them to go unscheduled for a few weeks, which could ultimately cause their separation from the company. âLeaders are trying to make sure partners understand that the lack of availability could lead to that,ï¿½?Mr. Borges said in an email."

McDonald's owns and operates 84% of its restaurants in Russia, with the rest run by franchisees, serving millions of customers daily, the chain said. The company said that both company and franchised restaurants will temporarily shut down in the country. The New York State Comptroller, who oversees the state's public pension fund investments that owns McDonald's shares, had called on the company to review its Russian business to assess the best interests of the company and its shareholders, including the New York State Common Retirement Fund . Online petitions have circulated on social media in recent days calling for McDonald's and other U.S. restaurant chains to pull out of Russia.  McDonald's also owns and operates 108 restaurants in Ukraine, along with corporate offices, employing nearly 10,000 people. Those locations are closed, and the company is working to maintain its payroll system in the country to keep paying employees there, McDonald's said in an internal message last week. Russia and Ukraine accounted for around 9% of McDonald's revenue last year given the high percentage of company owned restaurants, the company said in a filing. The countries accounted for 2% of sales across McDonald's , and less than 3% of operating income, the chain said. (END) Dow Jones Newswires March 08, 2022 14:03 ET (19:03 GMT)"
145,1,Poland - Energy Prices - Electricity,340 words,Global Energy Research,"In 2020, the Spot price of electricity on the TGE/POLPX exchange was ï¿½?1.6/MWh (-23%). In December 2021, the URE approved a 24% increase in household power tariffs from Enea, PGE, Tauron, and Energa in 2022 due to high wholesale energy prices and the costs of purchasing CO2 emission rights. The tariff increase amounts to about PLN21/month (ï¿½?.6/month) and will apply to 9.8 million households, i.e., 63% of residential customers. In October 2021, Poland allocated as much as PLN3-5bn (ï¿½?50m-1.1bn) in 2022 to help households to cope with rising energy prices. The government aims to support the country's poorest households with an aid of PLN700/year (ï¿½?50/year) for a household of four. More than 2.6 million households could benefit from the measure. In 2018, the government cut the excise tax paid by domestic power consumers from PLN20/MWh (ï¿½?.66/MWh) to PLN5/MWh (ï¿½?.17/MWh) to offset the increase in wholesale price. The price cap for mid-size and large companies was removed in mid-2019. Subsequently, the government adopted a text to help the industrial sector cope with soaring electricity prices caused by rising CO2 emissions costs. Under the programme, the country provides around PLN 900m (ï¿½?11 m) per year from 2020 to energy-intensive companies to help them remain competitive.

490,1,"Reactive Technologies Brings Accurate, Real-Time Resiliency Measurements Of Electrical Grids To North America",994 words,Contify Energy News,"New York, April 14 -- Reactive Technologies Ltd. issued the following news release: - Grid resilience technology company that simplifies integration of renewable energy into electrical grids is recognized as a 2022 Bloomberg New Energy Finance Pioneer for its potential to âaccelerate global decarbonizationï¿½?Reactive Technologies, a U.K.-based grid resilience technology company, announced today its expansion into North American markets in order to help U.S. and Canadian grid operators, electric utilities, and regulators accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon power grid. The announcement followed Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) naming Reactive a 2022 Pioneer for its contributions to âproviding round-the-clock zero-emissions power.ï¿½?âBloombergNEFâs recognition of Reactiveâs role in seamlessly providing zero-emissions power is a testament to our best-in-class grid resiliency measurement technologies, and the creativity and dedication of our amazing team,ï¿½?said Marc Borrett, Co-Founder and CEO of Reactive Technologies. âReactiveâs Grid-Sonarï¿½?technology enables utilities and grid operators around the world to accelerate decarbonization while maintaining grid resiliency. As the growth of renewable energy sources to North American grids accelerates, the need to accurately measure grid inertia in real time is becoming increasingly important. We look forward to working with our U.S. and Canadian partners to lay the groundwork for creating resilient renewable grids for the 21st century.ï¿½?Reactive was founded in the UK and Finland in 2010 and has deployed its technology in the U.K., Japan, Germany, Italy, Australia and New Zealand. Most recently, the company launched a six-year commercial service with National Grid ESO, the largest electric utility in the U.K, to achieve the highest level of visibility into real-time grid stability to date. Reactiveâs North America headquarters are in New York City, and its U.S. team is led by Regional Executive Director Jack Joyce, who previously worked for EPRI, General Electric, Siemens and the New York Power Authority (NYPA). Reactiveâs strategic partners Accenture and Eaton will support its market expansion and help disseminate its technology to utilities and grid operators across the U.S. and Canada. Reactiveâs unique measurement systems enable entirely new measurements, deep into the real-time operation of the power system, providing unprecedented transparency of grid operations and status and smoothing the transition to a zero-carbon grid. Grid inertia, the ability of a system to continue supplying electricity after a generator goes offline, can be negatively impacted by the addition of renewable generation sources like wind and solar. In recent months, regional transmission operator PJM and regional electric industry group WECC both identified inertia as a grid function operators need to effectively and accurately measure. Today, most grid operators rely on models and estimates of grid inertia, limiting visibility of grid operations and risking the transition to a lower-carbon grid. Reactiveâs flagship technology combines Grid-SonarTM, a micro-pulse of energy, with cloud computing to provide the worldâs first instantaneous direct measurement of grid inertia. Armed with real-time data on grid inertia and frequency, managers can add distributed, zero-carbon generators and other assets to the grid without sacrificing resilience. Reactive was announced as a BNEF Pioneers 2022 finalist in February 2022, and after an exhaustive review, declared a winner this week. For more than a decade, the BNEF Pioneers program has identified a group of game-changing technologies or innovations annually ï¿½?each with the potential to accelerate global decarbonization and halt climate change. BNEF Pioneers 2022 finalists were rated on specific challenges, among them, the capacity to provide round-the-clock zero-emissions power, and the ability to demonstrate technologies that can provide inertia and bolster system strength. About Reactive Technologies: Reactive Technologies is a grid resilience technology company helping grid operators, electric utilities, and regulators transition to Net Zero and ensure resilient renewables-based power grids. Reactiveâs products, including the first-of-its-kind Grid-Sonarï¿½?technology, bring unprecedented transparency to grid operations by replacing guesswork and modeling with real-time measurements of grid inertia and other functions. Reactive has worked with some of the most advanced electric utilities in the world and consistently delivers accurate grid data that informs better planning, full utilization of electricity supplies, and cost savings while enabling an accelerated transition to clean energy. Reactive is backed by several of the worldâs leading climate tech venture and management firms, including BGF, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Eaton, and Accenture Ventures.

110,0,"What to expect from New York's Blue Ribbon Restaurants, coming to the Hotel Commonwealth this spring",781 words,The Boston Globe,"Blue Ribbon owners Bruce and Eric Bromberg, brothers who grew up in New Jersey, acknowledge how much those businesses meant to the Kenmore and Fenway Park areas. âWe've always been really interested in being an anchor in neighborhoods and connecting to the community. And, you know, ultimately, for 30 years, Blue Ribbon has been a neighborhood restaurant, wherever we've gone,ï¿½?Bruce Bromberg says. âSo, because of that, I think the project just made sense to us from day one.ï¿½?The first Blue Ribbon, a brasserie not unlike Eastern Standard, opened in SoHo in 1992. Their first sushi restaurant opened in 1995, a little sliver of a space on Sullivan Street on the outskirts of SoHo that was once a stroller closet for a nearby apartment building. It was one of the first sushi restaurants designed to welcome novice sushi-samplers. âIf you have ever felt like a clumsy foreigner and worried about doing the wrong thing in a sushi bar, this is the place for you,ï¿½?wrote Ruth Reichl, then The New York Times restaurant critic. Today, there are Blue Ribbon sushi bars and brasseries scattered across the country. This sushi bar will replace the Hawthorne, the moody little cocktail den in between Eastern Standard and Island Creek. It will have about 110 seats, plus outdoor dining. âWe're kind of going back and revisiting our original restaurant, which really resonated with the community and everyone else in a way that made sushi accessible back in the day when there were only high-end Japanese places or all-you-can-eat sushi. There wasn't a lot anywhere in between,ï¿½?Bruce says. Eric Bromberg describes the menu as âtraditional homestyle cooking from Japan. What we've done with that, really, is to try to stay as true to traditional sushi and Japanese dishes as we can ï¿½?basically sushi in its cleanest form.ï¿½?Blue Ribbon began as a collaboration with longtime sushi chef and partner Toshi Ueki, who died in 2018. The restaurant has three rooms, âalmost like you're entering into a back street in Tokyo,ï¿½?Bruce says, with a cocktail bar, a sushi bar, and two side rooms with a connector that he calls an âamoeba,ï¿½?plus a raised mezzanine with plantings. âIt creates a bit of a voyeuristic view in and out for the customers and for the passersby,ï¿½?he says.

649,0,"UPDATE 1-Google, Facebook, Twitter must combat Ukraine fake news - Polish, Baltic leaders",379 words,Reuters News,"BRUSSELS, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Alphabet unit Google and its subsidiary YouTube, Facebook and Twitter must do more to tackle disinformation related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the premiers of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia said. In a joint letter to the chief executives of the four companies dated Feb. 27, the four prime ministers criticised the U.S. tech giants, saying what they have done so far is inadequate. ""Although the online platforms have undertaken significant efforts to address the Russian government's unprecedented assault on truth, they have not done enough,"" they said in the letter. ""Russia's disinformation has been tolerated on online platforms for years; they are now an accessory to the criminal war of aggression the Russian government is conducting against Ukraine and the free world."" They urged the companies to proactively suspend accounts denying, glorifying or justifying wars of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity. They also urged the tech giants to suspend the official accounts of Russian and Belarusian government institutions, state-controlled media and personal accounts of the countries' leadership and their associates that consistently disseminate disinformation about the situation in Ukraine. The countries called on the companies to prevent Russian state-controlled media from circumventing restrictions imposed by several national regulators against them. The online platforms should adjust their search and recommendation algorithms to inform users of disinformation and immediately demonetise all accounts controlled by the Russian and Belarusian governments, they said.  Facebook referred to a Sunday tweet by its vice-president Nick Clegg which said the company was reviewing other government requests to restrict Russian state-controlled media. It will continue to label and fact-check these outlets as well as prohibit ads and demonetise their accounts globally, the tweet added.  Google and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Russian state-controlled news service Sputnik said on Monday its Polish site was no longer available to users, and that Youtube had subsequently banned its account in Poland.

Today there are 52 external government loans totaling $112.2 billion, while the development was only 80 percent, the senator emphasized. ""Among the key factors in the increase in the country's external debt are inefficient use, lack of demand for borrowed money, cancellation of part of the loan, also attraction of money by quasi-state companies for non-productive purposes,"" Bekenov added. ""Subsidiary of KazMunayGas JSC (KMG) attracted a loan for a period of three years in the amount of $300 million for the purpose of further distribution to shareholders in the form of dividends in 2017, in the presence of own funds. This loan was attracted to pay dividends. These are just some examples of inefficient planning and use of international loans,"" the MP said. Nurlan Bekenov announced a number of systemic measures that were developed during a meeting of senators with representatives of state authorities and the quasi-state sector on the effectiveness of external state loans, to improve the current situation, among them, the implementation of constant monitoring of the procurement process and contract management, improving the quality of projects under development to eliminate their further irrelevance. ""It is important to attract external loans through the prism of a critical analysis of current areas of financing, clear regulation of the cost of design estimates and prioritization of costs in all sectors of the economy,"" Bekenov added."

640,0,"Facebook-owner Meta says Ukraine's military, politicians targeted in hacking campaign",760 words,Reuters News,"A Twitter spokesperson said the company had also suspended more than a dozen accounts and blocked the sharing of several links for violating its rules against platform manipulation and spam. It said its ongoing investigation indicated the accounts originated in Russia and sought to disrupt the public conversation around the conflict in Ukraine. A spokesperson for Alphabet Inc's YouTube said it had terminated several YouTube channels, which had fewer than 90 subscribers in total, as part of its investigation into coordinated influence operations linked to Russia. In a blog post on Monday, Meta attributed the hacking efforts to a group known as Ghostwriter, which it said successfully gained access to the targets' social media accounts. Meta said the hackers attempted to post YouTube videos from the accounts portraying Ukrainian troops as weakened, including one video which claimed to show Ukrainian soldiers coming out of a forest and flying a white flag of surrender. Ukrainian cybersecurity officials said on Friday that hackers from neighboring Belarus were targeting the private email addresses of Ukrainian military personnel ""and related individuals,"" blaming a group code-named UNC1151. The U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye has previously connected the group with Ghostwriter activities. Meta's security team said it had taken steps to secure targeted accounts and had blocked the hackers' phishing domains. It declined to give the targets' names but said it had alerted users where possible. MASQUERADING AS NEWS Meta said the separate influence campaign, which used a number of fictitious personas, claimed to be based in Kyiv and ran a small number of websites masquerading as independent news outlets. These outlets published claims about the West betraying Ukraine and Ukraine being a failed state. The company said it had found links between this influence network and an operation it removed in April 2020, which it had connected to individuals in Russia, the Donbass region in Ukraine and two media outlets based in Crimea: NewsFront and SouthFront, now sanctioned by the U.S. government. SouthFront said it had been banned by Facebook at least four times before, that its team is not in Crimea and that its coverage aims to be objective. NewsFront did not respond to a request for comment. In a news briefing, Meta declined to specific numbers give but said the influence campaign's content had seen a ""very low level"" of shares, posts or reactions. It said the campaign had fewer than 4,000 Facebook accounts following one or more of its pages and fewer than 500 accounts following its Instagram accounts. It did not say how long the campaigns had been active on its platforms. Meta said the campaign had also used Twitter, YouTube, Telegram and Russian social media sites Odnoklassniki and VK. Telegram and VK, which also owns Odnoklassniki, did not respond to requests for comment. The crisis in Ukraine has seen escalating clashes between Moscow and major tech companies. On Friday, Russia said it would partially restrict access to Facebook, a move Meta said came after it refused a government request to stop the independent fact-checking of several Russian state media outlets. On Saturday, Twitter also said its service was being restricted for some Russian users. Ukraine has been buffeted by digital intrusions and denial-of-service actions both in the run-up to and during the Russian invasion, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"". Several big tech companies have announced measures to bolster the security and privacy of their users in the country. Meta, which has in recent days made changes, such as disabling searches and viewing of the friends lists of Facebook accounts in Ukraine, said on Monday it was also making this change in Russia in response to public reports of civil society and protesters being targeted.

230,1,Uganda powers industry with lower energy tariff,525 words,The East African,"While announcing the new tariff for this quarter, ERA officials said the demand for electricity had jumped from 1,260.25 GWh between October and December 2021 to 1,353.1 GWh in the first three months of 2022. According to ERA, the growth is attributed to the full reopening of the economy and other initiatives such as the cooking tariff. âEarly indications show that domestic consumers have taken up this at a rate higher than usual,ï¿½?explained Patrick Tutembe, the Principal Economist ï¿½?Pricing, at ERA. The tariff reduction is mainly supported by exchange rate appreciation, as the Uganda shilling continues to hold strong against the dollar in recent months and throughout the pandemic period. For example, the Uganda shilling appreciated against the dollar by 0.71 percent from Ush3,564.09 to the dollar in quarter one of 2022 to Ush3,538.96 to the dollar in the second quarter.  Umeme bonanza The new tariff also considers the countryâs energy mix growth towards capacity plants and inflation, with the consumer price index increasing by 1.01 percent from 115.35 for November 2021, to 116.52 for February this year. Despite the lower tariff, the growth in demand for electricity is a boon for power distributor Umeme, which registered $524.6 million in revenues for 2021, up from $446 million in 2020. But the governmentâs push for industrialisation could dampen Umemeâs fortunes as President Yoweri Museveni has calls for a policy to bypass the distributor and supply power direct to large and extra-large industrial consumers. Already, the government has started a pilot to take power directly to two industrial parks ï¿½?Kapeka and MMP industrial park, a move that will starve the power distribution utility firms, if rolled out to cover the rest of the industrial parks. Policy shift Last month, the president promised Chinese investors, he would amend the law and fast track direct supply of power to industrial parks. âPower should go directly from generation to the consumer, especially the industrial consumer. We should amend the law. I will talk to the Speaker [of Parliament],ï¿½?he said, during the meeting. Economists say what will determine whether this policy shift can be fully rolled out or dropped, if whether the consumption capacity of industries will lead to increased demand for power. The experts cite the need to utilise the generation capacity from the solar plants, mini hydros, and mega dams like the 600MW Karuma hydropower project, expected to come on stream this year."

234,0,SOK closes Prismat and hotels in St. Petersburg - no plans to return to Russia*** TRANSLATED ***,614 words,STT,"- Withdrawal from the Russian business was the only possible solution for SOK, Annala answered STT's e-mail on Friday on whether the decision was influenced by the departure of other companies from Russia. Numerous Western companies and retail chains have withdrawn from Russia since the war in Ukraine. For example, the furniture chain Ikea's department stores are open on the last day on Friday. According to Annala, business in St. Petersburg became challenging first with the corona pandemic and then with the war. The S Group emphasizes in its press release that it strongly condemns the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The company has already announced this week that it will remove products of Russian origin from the selections of its stores. The products of the prisms are sold out SOK has 16 Prisma and three Sokos Hotels in St. Petersburg. There are a total of about a thousand employees. According to Annala, the exact schedule for the closure of both Prisms and the hotel is currently being determined, but the shutdown has already begun. - The aim is to sell Prisma's products on a fast schedule, Annala says in an e-mail. According to the S Group's press release, the shutdown of businesses will be carried out taking into account personnel and local legislation. According to Annala, the sanctions imposed on Russia by Western countries have, in practice, led to significant difficulties in payment transactions both within Russia and between Russia and Finland. The operation of shopping centers partly owned by SRV will continue Construction company SRV has acted as a sub-investor in three shopping centers in Russia. The company says in its press release that shopping center operations in Russia will continue for the time being. - Our goal has been to gradually reduce operations in the Russian market by selling our stake in shopping centers, the press release says. The company says it is exploring opportunities to accelerate secession from Russia. According to the company, recent sanctions are also expected to affect the shopping center business. SRV's net sales in Russia last year were almost EUR 7 million. Net sales consisted mainly of net sales from the operation of shopping centers and the recognition of sales revenue from one project. SRV no longer has a construction business in Russia. In total, SRV's turnover last year was more than EUR 930 million. The availability of building materials is expected to decline The company says it has outlined that it will completely stop sourcing building materials from Russia. The reason is Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In Finland, a small amount of the building materials used on SRV's construction sites have come from the Russian or Ukrainian markets. The company says so far its construction projects have progressed normally. - Due to the prevailing state of war, sanctions and counter-sanctions, the availability of materials is expected to become more challenging and material prices to rise, the release said. In February, SRV sold its 1.8 percent stake in the nuclear power company Fennovoima to the Russian nuclear power company Rosatom's subsidiary RAOS Voima and exited the project management agreements for the construction of the Hanhikivi 1 nuclear power project. *** DISCLAIMER: THIS IS AN AUTOMATED TRANSLATION FROM FINNISH ***"

647,1,Tariffs: Government calls for a hearing to increase electricity and gas rates,596 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"On the other hand, the 10% of residential users of Gas and Electricity Services, with the highest payment capacity of the society, will no longer receive the Energy subsidy benefit. On the other hand, the 10% of residential users of Gas and Electricity Services, with the highest payment capacity of the company, will no longer receive the benefit of the Energy subsidy. Thus, for most residential users of Edenor and Edesur, excluding those who are beneficiaries of the social tariff, electricity bills will have an average correction of 17%. On the other hand, the average correction for most of the Gas users in the country will be 21.5% with slight variations according to the regions. ""The Secretary of Energy with Respective Resolutions, established the call for Public Hearings, which will put these mechanisms and tariff updates to the consideration of the users, which will especially contemplate the situation of the vulnerable sectors and those with lower payment capacity, within the margins defined therein and which will be governed by the principle of gradualness"", expressed the official statement. Criteria for the update For residential users, an objective criterion will be considered as a tariff correction related to the evolution of their income, represented by the coefficient of salary variation (CVS), as established in Law No. 27,443, which was frustrated by the total veto imposed by the previous administration. For 90% of residential users, this mechanism guarantees that the tariff updates will always be lower than their salary increases, implying corrections in their bills lower than the increase in their income in real terms, with the purpose of protecting real income and improving the distributive aspect of the subsidy policy. In this way, the Government is considering a tariff scheme for the 2022-2023 biennium that contemplates three levels: Gas users who are beneficiaries of the social tariff, for whom there will not be another increase in their bill this year, and for the next calendar year, that correction will be equivalent to 40% of the CVS of the previous year. For Edenor and Edesur social tariff beneficiaries, the new tariff correction for 2022 will not exceed 6%. For the rest of the users, the total increase in the bill for each calendar year will be equivalent to 80% of the Salary Variation Coefficient (CVS) corresponding to the previous year. Based on this scheme, for the year 2022 and considering the tariff update carried out last March, the proposed increase for the month of June will be an average of 17% for Electricity tariffs for AMBA users, and an average of 21.5% over the current value of the bill for Gas users throughout the country. The exact variations will vary according to each residential rate category and also the region for Gas users. The 10% of users with the highest income and with full payment capacity will no longer benefit from the energy consumption subsidy."

Among the operations being targeted was News UK, the London-based division that publishes the Sun and the Times and owns TalkSport and Virgin Radio. The group contacted US authorities and cybersecurity consultants Mandiant after discovering ""attack activity"" on several of its businesses on January 20. In an email to staff seen by The Telegraph, David Kline, chief technology officer of News Corp, said: ""Our preliminary analysis indicates that foreign government involvement may be associated with this activity, and that some data was taken. ""Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus and believes they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests. ""We will not tolerate attacks on our journalism, nor will we be deterred from our reporting, which provides readers everywhere with the news that matters,"" he added. News Corp said the attack had affected the business email accounts and documents of a ""limited number of employees"" inside its headquarters and across news technology services, Dow Jones, News UK and the New York Post. Christopher Wray, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said on Thursday that America suffered more cyber-attacks by China than all other nations combined. ""The Chinese government steals staggering volumes of information and causes deep, job-destroying damage across a wide range of industries, so much so that, as you heard, we're constantly opening new cases to counter their intelligence operations, about every 12 hours or so,"" he said. The announcement came as News Corp reported third-quarter results, where it revealed an extension to a multi-year agreement with Apple that builds on a previous partnership under which the iPhone maker pays for stories that appear on its news app. News Corp said it expects the move to be ""an important source of subscription and advertising revenue"" for its news sites, as revenues climbed 13pc to a record $2.7bn (Â£1.9bn) for the last three months of 2021. Profits also rose 18pc over the period to $586m (Â£432m), buoyed by a sales bump across its news publishing arm from cash-for-content deals and an advertising rebound. Robert Thomson, the chief executive, said: ""Our businesses are thriving, particularly at the digital real estate services, Dow Jones and book publishing segments, and there was a pronounced surge in profitability at our news media segment.

The launch of TalkTV comes four years after Mr Murdoch sold Sky, the satellite TV provider he founded in 1989."
887,0,How Facebook became the opium of the masses,906 words,EJ Insight,"Since its launch in 2004, Facebook has grown from a studentsï¿½?social networking site into a surveillance monster that destroys social cohesion and democracy worldwide. Facebook collects troves of user data ï¿½?including intimate facts, like body weight and pregnancy status ï¿½?to map the social DNA of its users. The company then sells this information to anyone ï¿½?from shampoo manufacturers to Russian and Chinese intelligence services ï¿½?who wants to âmicro-targetï¿½?its 2.9 billion users. In this way, Facebook allows third parties to manipulate minds and trade in âhuman futuresï¿½? predictive models of the choices individualsï¿½?likely will make. Around the world, Facebook has been used to sow distrust in democratic institutions. Its algorithms have facilitated real-world violence, from genocide in Myanmar to the recruitment of terrorists in South America, West Africa, and the Middle East. Lies about election fraud in the United States, promoted by former President Donald Trump, inundated Facebook in the lead-up to the January 6 riots. Meanwhile in Europe, Facebook enabled Belarusian strongman Aleksandr Lukashenkoâs perverse efforts to use migrants as weapons against the European Union. In the Czech Republic, disinformation originating from Russia and shared on the site has swamped Czech cyberspace, thanks to Facebookâs malicious code. One analysis done by my company found that the average Czech citizen is exposed to 25 times more COVID-19 vaccine disinformation than the average American. The situation is so dire, and government action so inept, that Czechs rely on civil society ï¿½?including volunteers known as the Czech Elves ï¿½?to monitor and counter this influence. Efforts to mitigate Facebookâs threat to democracy so far have failed miserably. In the Czech Republic, Facebook entered into a partnership with Agence France-Presse (AFP) to identify harmful content. But with just one part-time employee and a monthly quota of only ten dubious posts, these efforts are a drop in the disinformation ocean. The âFacebook files,ï¿½?published by The Wall Street Journal, confirm that Facebook takes action on âas little as 3-5% of hate speech.ï¿½? Facebook has given users the ability to opt out of custom and political ads, but this is a token gesture. Some organizations, like Ranking Digital Rights, have called for the platform to disable ad targeting by default. That is not enough. The micro-targeting at the root of Facebookâs business model relies on artificial intelligence to attract usersï¿½?attention, maximize engagement, and disable critical thinking. In many ways, micro-targeting is the digital equivalent of the opioid crisis. But the US Congress has moved aggressively to protect people from opioids through legislation designed to increase access to treatment, education, and alternative medications. To stop the worldâs addiction to fake news and lies, lawmakers must recognize the disinformation crisis for what it is and take similar action, starting with appropriate regulation of micro-targeting. The problem is that no one outside Facebook knows how the companyâs complex algorithms work ï¿½?and it could take months, if not years, to decode them. This means that regulators will have no choice but to depend on Facebookâs own people to guide them through the factory. To encourage this cooperation, Congress must offer blanket civil and criminal immunity and financial indemnification. Regulating social media algorithms seems complicated, but it is low hanging fruit compared to even greater digital hazards on the horizon. âDeepfakesï¿½?ï¿½?the AI-based large-scale manipulation of videos and images to sway opinion ï¿½?is barely a topic of conversation in Congress. While lawmakers fret over the threats posed by traditional content, deepfakes pose an even greater challenge to individual privacy, democracy, and national security. Meanwhile, Facebook is becoming more dangerous. A recent investigation by MIT Technology Review found that Facebook funds misinformation by âpaying millions of ad dollars to bankroll clickbait actorsï¿½?through its advertising platform. And CEO Mark Zuckerbergâs plans to build a metaverse, âa convergence of physical, augmented, and virtual reality,ï¿½?should frighten regulators everywhere. Just imagine the potential damage those unregulated AI algorithms could cause if they are permitted to create a new immersive reality for billions of people. In a statement after recent hearings in Washington, DC, Zuckerberg repeated an offer he has made before: regulate us. âI donât believe private companies should make all of the decisions on their own,ï¿½?he wrote on Facebook. âWeâre committed to doing the best work we can, but at some level the right body to assess tradeoffs between social equities is our democratically elected Congress.ï¿½?Zuckerberg is correct: Congress does have a responsibility to act. But Facebook has a responsibility to act as well. It can show Congress what social inequities it continues to create and how it creates them. Until Facebook opens its algorithms to scrutiny ï¿½?guided by the know-how of its own experts ï¿½?the war on disinformation will remain unwinnable, and democracies around the world will continue to be at the mercy of an unscrupulous, renegade industry.

907,0,Licence fee squeeze and staff unrest to challenge incoming BBC News boss,1165 words,The Telegraph Online,"""[Audiences] are relying on big brand newsrooms for information they could trust to protect their families,"" she added. ""There really is no higher purpose than that. It is like being at war. Where did audiences turn to then-they turned to our newsrooms."" Turness was setting out her stall to The Telegraph in July[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/07/03/itn-chief-deborah-turness-fights-corner-gb-news-muscles/] as the new chief executive of ITN, the company behind the news programming for ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5. Fast-forward just six months and she is jumping ship to their biggest rival[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/01/06/bbc-replace-director-news-fran-unsworth-ex-nbc-executive-deborah/], taking on the toughest fight of her career. After a chaotic search, the 54-year-old has been confirmed as the BBC's head of news at a time of cultural tumult within its walls[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/12/15/bbcs-younger-journalists-do-not-understand-impartiality-former/]. The help cannot come soon enough for Tim Davie. Auntie's director general is trying to protect and reinforce the BBCâs reputation amid a barrage of criticism from ministers linked to accusations of left-wing bias, a failure to confront its short-comings and concerns its corporate governance is being weakened by ""group-think"". Rancour is also building among BBC staff over Â£408m of cuts hollowing out the newsroom as an incoming financial settlement on the Â£159 licence fee is expected to bring greater budgetary pressure. And, as autocratic regimes including Russia and China dial up investment in state-funded broadcasters, Turness must wage an international battle to secure the BBC's future as an impartial global news provider. In a statement on Thursday, Turness burnished the BBC's international profile, saying it was a ""great privilege"" to lead and grow the broadcaster when ""its content is reaching more global consumers on more platforms than ever before"". It underscored Auntieâs value as one of Britain's biggest global soft powers, with the BBC hoping to become a panacea for tech giants as pressure mounts on them to stem disinformation. Yet it is far from the only organisation making a pitch for global dominance of trusted journalism. The New York Times' $550m (Â£450m) acquisition of subscription sports site The Athletic creates a global challenger for the BBC website, which makes money from advertising overseas. Competition for talent is also likely to become more fierce. Supporters are backing Turness to succeed. ITV News business and economics editor Joel Hills tweeted: ""The BBC has just signed Messi. The bad news is itâs from us."" Others believe she needs to sharpen her approach. An ITN insider says: âShe had ten ideas a day, some brilliant, some frankly embarrassing. At ITN the horrible ones mostly never got noticed, but she wonât have that leeway at the BBC.ï¿½?Those knowledgeable of Turness' management approach say she is ""collegiate but decisive"" with a ""gentle but firm"" style. In her notable broadcasting career she became the first, and youngest, female editor of ITV News before moving stateside as president of NBC News International. Before rejoining ITN last year, she spearheaded the launch of NBC Sky World News-a global brand designed to challenge the BBC and CNN-before the idea was abandoned by parent Comcast when ad sales plunged during the pandemic. ""She ticks a lot of boxes,"" a BBC source says, referring to her global broadcasting experience. Davie certainly seemed determined to land her as the successor to Fran Unsworth, who oversaw a turbulent four years marred by intense scrutiny of management following Lord Dyson's damning report of Martin Bashir's 1995 interview with Princess Diana[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/06/19/battle-tame-bbc-hots-wake-bashir-cover-up/]. Confirmation of Turness in the Â£400,000-a-year position brought a close to a seemingly scatter-gun process after she initially turned it down. Today programme presenter Nick Robinson was linked to the position last month, according to the Mail on Sunday. He joined a string of media heavyweights such as John McAndrew, former head of news programming at GB News, and Kevin Backhurst, Ofcom's group director of content and media policy. Turness also beat internal favourite Jonathan Munro, deputy director of BBC News and head of news content, who became drawn into the Bashir scandal after praising the journalist when he was reappointed in 2016. Among Turnessï¿½?early challenges will be choosing a new political editor to replace Laura Kuenssberg, a decision that will be closely monitored by Downing Street[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/10/22/laura-kuenssbergs-replacement-bbc-political-editor-should-brexiteer/]. Culture secretary Nadine Dorries inflamed the Government's impartiality row with the BBC in November when she criticised Kuenssberg's reporting as ridiculous after the journalist quoted an anonymous Tory MP, who claimed Boris Johnson's authority was ""evaporating"". It won't take long before her mettle is tested. BBC managers are renowned for facing public criticism. In November, for instance, an internal backlash ensued after the BBC decided to pull out of the workplace equality scheme led by LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall. Concerns the BBC is no longer impartial has caused eight trans staff to leave, according to a report by Vice News. The broadcaster responded that it was ""full-committed to be an industry-leading employer on LGBTQ+ inclusion"". Lord Grade of Yarmouth, who is part of a panel reviewing public service broadcasters, believes Turness must tackle the BBC's propensity to defend mistakes. ""When they have got something wrong, they need to own up immediately,"" he says. ""It's a shocking habit and it is a sign of weakness, not strength and it drives me crazy. They are not very good at admitting to mistakes quickly.ï¿½?The most immediate test will come at the end of this month when the BBC is expected to finalise a five-year deal with ministers to freeze or increase the licence fee at just below inflation. The latter could prove costly as the broadcasterâs budget comes under pressure from American streaming giants[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/01/01/netflix-plays-squid-game-global-streaming-battle-escalates/], whose appetite for making shows in Britain is pushing production costs higher. Roger Mosey, former head of BBC Television News, says Auntie was pleased to have the chance to negotiate with the Government after previous settlements were ""sprungï¿½?on it. But he fears the outcome could demand more cost-cutting when there is no more fat on the bone to trim. ""The savings they have now made in BBC News are pretty serious and draconian,ï¿½?he says. âIf the BBC is squeezed financially still more, then you will really notice the results-it is not crying wolf anymore."" For Turness, there has never been a ""greater need for the BBC's powerful brand of impartial and trusted journalism"". But leading the charge as the purse strings tighten will be a battle few leaders want to face."
896,1,Wellbeing Digital Sciencesï¿½?New CEO Unveils Evolved Competitive Strategy,990 words,The Canadian Press,"With expertise spanning several areas of mental health treatments as well as contract research, Wellbeing will facilitate the development and clinical adoption of novel mental health treatments. The comprehensive plan is expected to bolster Wellbeingâs goal of becoming the healthcare model of choice in North America for the treatment of mental illnesses. The Companyâs pursuits are to be centred around the following values and mission: * To enrich lives through mental healthcare services; * To transform lives, improve patient experience, through a contemporary, global and comprehensive mental healthcare model of service; * To equip clinicians with new tools to complement existing pharmacotherapeutic approaches; * To re-conceptualize the way mental health services are delivered to the community; and * To make a positive impact on the lives of patients, create an active network of collaborating mental heath experts, foster future innovation, and re-engineer the way present-day mental healthcare services are delivered to create change and improve patient outcomes. By the age of 40, approximately 50% of the population will suffer or have suffered from a mental health illness.1 Accordingly, the Companyâs management team deems it to be more important now than ever to find innovative and effective solutions to address mental illness issues.

Both the psychedelic medicine and digital therapeutics sectors are moving at lightspeed to address this, but they face two major obstacles; clinical development to gain regulatory approvals, and clinical adoption by the medical establishment. Wellbeing provides a solution to both of these problems faced by industry which more importantly allows us to provide our patients with early access to life-saving treatments,ï¿½?said Najla Guthrie, CEO of Wellbeing. âWe are passionate about being part of the evolution to foster initial change in the current mental health system and re-evaluate future change through our Wellbeing expert network.

526,0,Restaurants are struggling. Here's another bid to help them out.,746 words,The Boston Globe,"âWhen I received the e-mail, I felt seen,"" said Katerina Iliades, owner of Greek International Food Market in West Roxbury. âIt felt like a glimmer of hope."" When COVID hit, Greek International lost all of its staff, leaving just Iliades and her chef to run the restaurant. She said she hopes to use the $5,000 to purchase a new grill and uniforms for employees. A nonprofit dedicated to magnifying the voices of women in the workplace, the Massachusetts Conference for Women awarded $330,000 in grant money last year, which founding board member Marian Heard said was crucial to keeping businesses afloat. The grant money is a fraction of the nearly $1 billion the federal government sent to Massachusetts restaurants in April as part of the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. But thousands of applicants were shut out from these payments ï¿½?and advocates are pushing for more federal and state funds to help the struggling industry. Some recipients of the Conference for Women grants missed the deadline to apply for federal assistance or did not know how to do so, making the recent financial aid that much more essential. âWe feel it's critical for women to support women, and we know quite honestly that last year we made a big difference in their business and their lives,"" said Heard, who is also vice chair of the board. The board voted to increase grant funding to $400,000 this year, and the selection process took months. In partnership with the Massachusetts Restaurant Â­Association, the Conference for Women encouraged female-owned restaurants around the state to apply, with a small form explaining how the grant money would impact them. The responses, Heard said, were âquite poignant."" âPeople are suffering, they need money just to keep the doors open,"" she said. âSo the money this year and last year was critical to the survival of some of these businesses."" An Nguyen, one of three female owners of grant recipient Sugidama Soba & Izakaya in Somerville, said business is down 50 percent since last summer and fall thanks to the Omicron-fueled surge in COVID cases. A majority of Sugidama's employees are women, Nguyen said, and the restaurant will likely use the grant money to support them. âEveryone is talking about labor shortages, but we've never had that problem,"" said Nguyen. âI think if you treated your employees well before the pandemic, they will be loyal to you."" Sandrine Rossi of Frenchie Wine Bistro in Boston has a similar vision of how she plans to use the grant money, and will put the funds toward supporting a manager's maternity leave. âI think one of the lessons of the pandemic is we need to take better care of ourselves and each other,"" said Rossi. â[The grant money] gives us room to have conversations about leave and vacation time, so we can plan better and it's easier on employees."" Kelly Fernandes, a co-owner of Ula Cafe in Jamaica Plain, called the grant a âblessing."" She said one of the biggest challenges has been the rising cost of supplies. âDealing with higher food costs has been really tough, because that forces us to raise our prices,"" said Fernandes. âWe're trying Â­really hard to not make it expensive to have a cup of coffee or to get a salad or sandwich."" Outside of the immediate impacts the grant money will have on the recipients, the $400,000 also reflects the importance of women-owned restaurants to the broader community, said Iliades. âI just feel very fortunate to be offered this opportunity,"" she said. âAs a mother of two young girls, it's often difficult to juggle work and home. And I feel that with this movement of women supporting one another, that it gives women and our daughters hope and pride to do what we're really passionate about.""

935,1,Press Release: FanDuel and Blue Apron Alum Lainie Cooney Joins Bambee as Chief People Officer,929 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 14, 2022-- Bambee, the company that makes Human Resources affordable for every small to medium-sized business, is announcing today that HR veteran Lainie Cooney has joined Bambee as the company's Chief People Officer. ""Part of my affection for building companies is driven by a genuine motivation to identify the often-overlooked gifts in people,"" said Allan Jones, founder and CEO of Bambee. ""My belief is that seemingly ordinary people are actually innately extraordinary. Lainie shares this inherent belief in people and for that and many other reasons, I'm thrilled she has come on board. As a founder, my job is to build a culture that isn't just lip service, but one that has texture and is unique in its ability to activate each person's potential. To date, we've done this by hiring the best people possible across as many diverse backgrounds as we can reach. I am confident Lainie will carry the torch here."" Bambee is a first-of-its kind HR technology company that helps nearly 10,000 of America's small businesses put their HR on autopilot while also pairing each company with a dedicated HR Manager. Bambee's mission and its unique place in the market helped lure Cooney away from the top people role at FanDuel, an American gambling company that offers sportsbook, daily fantasy sports, online casino, poker, and horse race betting products that has recently been valued at $30B+. Cooney now joins Bambee's stellar executive team, comprised of former Headspace alum, Steven Gross, chief financial officer, former Bird Head of Government, Tommy Tate, chief product officer, and former ADP VP of Product Development, Mike Ruangutai, chief technology officer. Beyond her last role at FanDuel, Cooney joins Bambee with a wealth of people leadership experience she's built over the last 25 years at brands such as Home Depot, State Street, DPI Foods, and Blue Apron. ""I am both honored and incredibly excited to join Bambee. Bambee is an amazing company with great people and visionary leaders. I am looking forward to helping us realize our vision for our employees, and for the workers of small businesses across this country,"" said Cooney. ""I had the honor of leading Blue Apron's people strategy as their workforce grew by almost 3x in my tenure. I had a similar honor at FanDuel as their workforce grew by 5x. So I'll be well suited at Bambee as we expect to grow from a diverse group of 120 employees, to 300 within 2022 alone."" As a leading HR company for America's small businesses, Bambee puts extra emphasis on its people strategy. One of its three core objectives in 2022 is to create the space for Bambee employees to do the most fulfilling work of their careers. ""Bambee views its internal people strategy as key to our external customers trusting us with their HR,"" Jones said. ""We hire for traits like high aptitude, kindness, introspection, self-accountability, broad levels of creativity, and thoughtful optimism. These traits are rarely present on a resume. We don't care if you have a technology background or a Harvard MBA. This philosophy has helped us create a workforce as deeply diverse as the nation. We are well above average in representation of women, Asian Americans, African Americans, and members of the Latinx and LGBTQ communities. We lead this way not to hit a diversity quota, but because we know that the best talent comes packaged in a variety of personas. Now we need the people infrastructure and people leadership to continue building our intellectually unique team at scale. Lainie Cooney is undeniably the leader to help us do this."" The company also recently announced its $30M Series C investment. In this latest round, SoftBank joined QED, leader of both Series B and C rounds, and AlphaEdison, who led the Series A round. Key investments were also made by Mucker Capital, Ken Chenault (chairman and managing director, General Catalyst; and former CEO and chairman of American Express), Damian Maldonado (CEO and founder at American Financing and American Home Agent), and Gaingels (the LGBTQIA+/Allies investment syndicate). About Bambee Allan Jones founded Bambee in 2016. Bambee has been at the forefront of solving HR problems for small businesses since its inception. Bambee puts their customers' HR on autopilot, starting with a dedicated HR Manager and smart automation. Bambee helps each company navigate the complex regulatory world of compliance, HR policy, employee relations, and HR strategy -- including internal investigations, hires, furloughs, and return to work procedures. The combination of a real HR Manager coupled with an intelligent software platform gets Bambee customers to HR compliance, and helps keep them HR compliant year-round. In October 2021, Goldman Sachs celebrated Jones as one of the 100 most intriguing entrepreneurs, at their Builders + Innovators Summit. For three years running, Forbes has named Bambee a top startup employer in the U.S., and in 2022 listed Bambee as top 5 in Los Angeles. Learn more at www.bambee.com [http://www.bambee.com].

624,0,How to protect yourself from possible cyberattacks: Talking Tech podcast,1203 words,USA Today Online,"Hey there, listeners. It's Brett Molina. Welcome back to Talking Tech. Security professionals are urging Americans to take immediate steps to protect themselves from what they describe as a higher risk of Russian cyber attacks following the invasion of the Ukraine. Some of these experts are noting that, with sanctions setting in, set by the US against Russia, it's a matter of time until the US is targeted more directly. Now, the odds of cyber attackers targeting Americans individually is unlikely. It is important to stay ahead of things and to be prepared. My colleague, Jessica Guynn, writes about this in a story that you can read on tech.usa today.com. She offers eight tips that you can take to help protect yourself. These are a lot of things you should be doing anyway, but if it's something you've put off and you haven't had a chance to do yet, now is the best time to do it. Let's break them all down here. The first one is: turn on multifactor authentication. What this is and what it does is, let's say you log into your Gmail account. You log in on a computer, you put in your passcode. If you have the multifactor authentication on, it'll ask you to apply a code to verify. In the case of Gmail, for example, if you already have it on your phone, you'll go to your phone, and you'll verify, say, ""is this you logging in on this computer,"" for example. There are other ways you can get those extra codes too. You can get them sent through text message or email. : I personally use Authy, which is an authentication app. It works with a lot of different services. And I have several apps tied to that. And what it does is, anytime you log in, the website or service will ask for a code from your authentication app. I'll go there, get the code, and type it in. It never goes through text or anything, so it's right directly on your phone. Super safe, super secure way to protect your account. Also good too if, say, someone finds your password; you still have that extra layer of defense there. The next step: update everything. Anything and everything: your phone, your computer. Check for updates, get it all up to speed. You want to have the latest update. A lot of hackers like to exploit those loopholes that then get patched. But it's up to the user to make sure everything's up to date and patched, so always double, triple check that. Anytime an alert for an update, make sure you're updating. Think before you click. This is an important one. Phishing emails, other stuff like that, they're trying to appeal to your emotions or fear, whatever. Take your time. Don't feel like you have to rush to click something. Take your time. Read it. One thing I do is if I get an email from a service, and I'm not sure why I'm getting it, I will go to the actual website and verify and see if this is something that is legitimate or not. Use strong, unique passwords. If you are using 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or typing in ""password,"" please stop. It puts you in danger. Use really strong passwords. Password managers are really good because you basically only have to think of one password, and it will create and store unique ones for every account you have, so you don't even have to think about it. You don't have worry about memorizing 50 different passwords. This manager takes care of it for you. This is something that I feel like in the early days of the internet, we really subscribe to, but not as much. And that's: don't believe everything online. Look at everything with a dose of skepticism. Just keep in mind, where's it coming from? What's the source of this information? A lot of times, again, there's that appeal to your emotion. And I have done this too. I share something just out of instinct because I feel emotionally invested in what it is that I'm reading, and I share it without thinking it through. And it happens to everybody. So, just try to try to keep an even keel as you see this stuff, whether it's popping up on social media, whether somebody emails it to you, whatever it is. Back up your most important files. That is always good, just in case. You want to have multiple places where you can find stuff. So that way, if something happens to your computer, you have a backup. Use a VPN if you're on public internet. VPN is a virtual private network. And it just protects you. If, say, you're somewhere like Starbucks, use a VPN, so that way, it encrypts your data first off. And also, people can't use that wifi to somehow get in and take a look at what you're doing on your computer. This one, security experts seem mixed on this. But stocking up on supplies: stuff like cash, having an emergency kit, making sure your car's filled up. Things like that. Again, it's kind of mixed reviews on this. I think it's reasonable anyway, if say, maybe you live somewhere where there's natural disasters. And one expert, Jessica talked to for a story, notes that ""worry about cybersecurity, the way you do mother nature."" So, if you already are thinking about that anyway, with stuff like natural disasters, things like that, it never hurts just to have cash on hand and an emergency kit and just have that ready in case, no matter what it. In this case, it might apply to something related to cybersecurity; you never know. So, I think that's good to have no matter what. But in this case, again, another reason to keep that handy.

924,0,Alberta unions call for circuit-breaker COVID-19 lockdown but Premier Kenney says no,661 words,The Canadian Press,"They say it's a difficult call but necessary to prevent the rapidly spreading variant from flooding hospitals and overwhelming an exhausted, depleted staff of frontline health workers. But a spokesman for Premier Jason Kenney says the United Conservative government is following and acting on the scientific data for the Omicron wave and that a lockdown is not being considered.  Alberta Health reports 708 people are in hospital with COVID-19 ï¿½?a rise of 73 from a day earlier ï¿½?with 80 of them in intensive care. There are now well over 58,000 active COVID-19 cases in Alberta but Dr. Deena Hinshaw, the chief medical officer of health, has said the case numbers are low and the actual infections are likely 10 times higher. The unions made the call for a lockdown in an open letter Tuesday. The letter is signed by the United Nurses of Alberta, the Alberta Teachersï¿½?Association and the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, which is the largest public sector union in the province. They say the latest wave of COVID-19 could have been avoided last month if Kenney's government had implemented stricter health restrictions and initiatives, such as supplying workers with higher grade N95 masks and installing high-efficiency air filtration systems. ""Because of the government's dangerous political pandering and its wilful policy negligence, we now have only two options to choose from: temporary circuit-breaker measures, on one hand, or a health-care system collapse and rising disease, disability and death, on the other,"" write the union leaders. ""We, along with what we expect would be a clear majority of Albertans, choose temporary circuit-breaker measures as the lesser of two evils."" The unions are also calling for a ban on concerts and sports events, and for religious services to move online. They add that the government has to renew income supports to keep affected businesses solvent. Justin Brattinga, a spokesman for Kenney, responded to the letter in a short statement: ""As we have done throughout the pandemic, we will follow the science and the advice of our public health officials. ""A circuit-breaker is not on the table and not being considered."" Kenney's government implemented new restrictions on public gatherings in late December, including half capacity at major venues and events. Most universities have already moved online this month for an indeterminate time. Kindergarten and grade-school students returned to class this week after an extra week off so that staff could prepare for Omicron. The province is delivering more masks and rapid tests to schools and has said students and staff will be the priority as millions more masks arrive this month. The Opposition NDP says Kenney has failed yet again to deal seriously with another wave of COVID-19 and is calling on the province to release its projections of the Omicron wave so that parents, students, employers and employees can see what is coming. Hinshaw said Monday that health officials are bracing for what she termed ""significant impact"" to the health system with a provincial positivity rate around 40 per cent. Both Hinshaw and Kenney say that vaccines are the best protection against the Omicron wave. Close to eight million COVID-19 vaccinations have been delivered in the province. Almost 90 per cent of those eligible ï¿½?age 12 and older ï¿½?have had at least one dose and more than 85 per cent are fully vaccinated. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 11, 2022."
617,0,Government demands tech giants pull Russian state media,933 words,The Sydney Morning Herald - Online,"Apple and Snapchat were also told to remove RT, formerly known as Russia Today, and Sputnik, the successor to Voice of Russia. ""I am writing to ask that [your company] takes action as a priority to suspend the dissemination on your platform[s] in Australia of content generated by Russian state media organisations, given that there has been a significant volume of such content promoting violence, extremism and disinformation in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" Mr Fletcher said in a letter sent on Thursday afternoon. The minister wrote that he wanted confirmation from the platforms as soon as possible that they had complied with his request. The move comes days after Australian TV networks Foxtel and SBS voluntarily pulled Russian state-owned news services, RT and Sputnik, from their services. Russian services have also been blocked or restricted by Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube in Europe, following a request from the European Commission. ""Given the current actions of the Russian government, and the lack of genuinely independent Russian media, these actions are responsible and appropriate,"" Mr Fletcher wrote. ""In light of the exceptional circumstances that are unfolding in Ukraine, and in the interests of protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Australian government asks that [your company] takes such action in respect of content disseminated on your platform[s] in Australia."" Earlier this week, Mr Fletcher urged the technology platforms to act responsibly and reminded them to adhere to the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation. A government source said at the time that more action would be taken if the platforms did not remove the content voluntarily. Media experts including Macquarie professor Peter Greste have previously warned a ban such as this would be counterproductive because it could lead to retaliation against Western reporters in Russia. Bermet Talant, journalist and researcher at the Alliance for Journalists' Freedom, who spent more than four years working in Ukraine, said banning state-based media was not the answer. ""Blanket censorship isn't a good approach,"" she said. ""What social media should do in this case is enforce their policies ï¿½?and those outlets should be vetted for disinformation, threats and other violations of social media policies. Russian propaganda is not limited to RT [and] Sputnik."" A Meta spokesperson said: ""We're reviewing the request from the Australian government. In the meantime, we will continue to label and fact check these outlets as well as prohibit ads and demonetise their accounts globally, including in Australia."" Meta wrote to Mr Fletcher on Thursday, offering him time to discuss the measures in detail or any specific concerns. Mr Fletcher did not request a meet with Meta.  Google, TikTok and Twitter. In a blog post from Snap on Tuesday, the company said it had never allowed Russian state media to distribute content on its âDiscover' page. ""We are vigilantly monitoring our platform for any evidence of disinformation or misuse while we focus on providing accurate news coverage and information to our global community through our partnerships with media publishers on our Discover content platform,"" the blog post said. ""On Discover, we only feature content from verified media partners and creators, and we have never allowed Russian state media to distribute content.""  Google said in a separate post earlier this week that it had blocked YouTube channels connected to RT and Sputnik across Europe and indefinitely paused monetisation of Russian state-funded media across its platforms in addition to removing hundreds of channels and thousands of videos for violating its guidelines. In a statement, Apple said it was deeply concerned about the invasion and stood with all people suffering. It would communicate with governments about its responses. ""RT News and Sputnik News are no longer available for download from the App Store outside Russia,"" the statement reads. At least one other app linked to the outlets, Sputnik Trending, remains on the store. The major technology companies have fact-checking processes, label content from state media, remove content that breaches their policies on misinformation and have diminished the reach of Russian media. RT says on its website that it is an autonomous, non-profit organisation that covers stories overlooked by the mainstream media and provides an alternative perspective on current affairs. Sputnik says it is a ""modern news agency"" that delivers global political and economic news. In its coverage of the restrictions placed on its social media presence, Sputnik quoted from Russia's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzya, who said the state faced an ""information war"". Opposition communications spokeswoman Michelle Rowland said she supported the government's consultation with media and social media companies.""It is appropriate that the Minister correspond formally with digital platforms on matters of such grave import,"" Ms Rowland said. ""Labor has sought a briefing from government."" The Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day's trading. Get it each weekday afternoon."

96,1,"Auto, industry demand lift chip sales 26.3%",462 words,Taipei Times,"The events behind the current chip shortage continue to impact [automotive and industrial] original equipment manufacturers [OEMs] around the world, Gartner research vice president Andrew Norwood wrote in the release. But the 5G smartphone ramp up and a combination of strong demand and logistics/raw material price increases drove semiconductor average selling prices higher, contributing to significant revenue growth in 2021, Norwood wrote. Semiconductors have become even more important across all industries, given higher chip content in everything from vehicles to home appliances and industrial automation facilities, and from smartphones to computers and data centers.  Gartner said the automotive market last year outperformed all other end markets amid recovering auto sales worldwide, with semiconductor sales from auto OEMs growing 34.9 percent from the previous year. Sales of memory chips last year rose US$41.3 billion, or 33.2 percent annually, as the sector benefited from strong demand for DRAM chips amid a shift to home or hybrid working and learning, Gartner said. This trend fueled increased server deployments by hyperscale cloud service providers to satisfy online working and entertainment, as well as a surge in end-market demand for PCs and ultramobiles, the researcher said. The wireless communications segment, smartphones in particular, represented another strong end market for chips last year, as robust demand for 5G smartphones and office Wi-Fi infrastructure upgrades by enterprises helped semiconductor sales grow 24.6 percent year-on-year, Gartner said. According to figures provided by Gartner, 556 million 5G smartphones were manufactured last year, a surge of 121.5 percent from 251 million in 2020.  Gartner did not provide a forecast for semiconductor sales this year. However, World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), a San Jose, California-based trade organization, predicted on March 18 that global semiconductor sales would increase 10.4 percent this year, following a 26.2 percent rise last year. Total sales would exceed US$600 billion for the first time ever this year, hitting US$613.52 billion, up from US$555.89 billion last year, WSTS said in a report. While all major product categories, including memory, analog, logic and discrete semiconductors, saw significant sales growth last year, sales of memory chips are expected to grow only 1.1 percent this year, compared with double-digit percentage growth across other semiconductor categories, WSTS said."
338,0,"UPDATE 3-Shake Shack fails to shake off Omicron impact, forecasts dour sales",363 words,Reuters News,"Benefits from easing COVID-19 Delta infections were short-lived for Shake Shack as the Omicron wave that soon followed dissuaded customers from venturing out, infected staff and set back the recovery of urban-centric restaurants. ""Drivers of our business such as office returns, events, travelers and the general gathering of people that contribute to Shake Shack's best results (turned) downward,"" Chief Executive Officer Randy Garutti said during an earnings call.  Shake Shack forecast first-quarter revenue of $196 million to $201.4 million, compared with analysts' average estimate of $210.9 million, according to Refinitiv IBES. ""We saw a more acute impact on SHAK sales from Omicron than its more geographically diversified peers ... expectations were just too optimistic and underestimated the Omicron impact,"" M Science analyst Matthew Goodman said. Rising paper and food expenses as well as labor costs have also put a squeeze on Shake Shack's margins. Credit Suisse analysts noted the company's margin forecast was also below consensus estimates. To protect its margins, Shake Shack will jack up prices in March and increase its third-party delivery menu prices, Garutti said. The company in October raised prices by 3% to 3.5%. Nearly every U.S. restaurant, including Chipotle Mexican Grill and McDonald's, has also raised prices. In the fourth quarter ended Dec. 29, same-store sales in Shake Shack's urban restaurants, which account for over half of its topline, declined 4% as many city dwellers moved to suburbs during the pandemic. However, that helped comparable sales at suburban restaurants gain 9%.  Shake Shack also pointed to a sales improvement in recent days, with monthly comparable sales through Feb. 15 jumping 13%, versus a 2% rise last month.

RMR's dividend rates are set and reset from time to time by RMR's Board of Directors. The RMR Board of Directors considers many factors when setting dividend rates including RMR's current and expected earnings, commitments to fund its investments and the availability of cash to fund dividends as compared to alternative uses of such cash. Accordingly, future dividend rates may be increased or decreased and there is no assurance as to the rate at which future dividends will be declared and paid. For these reasons, among others, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward looking statements in this press release. Except as required by law, RMR does not intend to update or change any forward looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

482,0,Wolseley owner Corbin & King forced into bankruptcy,648 words,Financial Times (FT.Com),"Minor, the Thai hotel operator, said on Tuesday that it had appointed administrators to oversee a recapitalisation of Corbin & King, owner of iconic haunts including the Delaunay and Brasserie Zedel as well as the Wolseley, a former car showroom next door to the Ritz on Piccadilly. The move marks the latest clash in an ongoing spat between the restaurant company and its biggest financial backer that started early in the pandemic over site openings and staffing levels. Minor said that Corbin & King had been âunable to meet its financial obligationsï¿½?and that despite Minorâs ârepeated proposals to recapitalise the companyï¿½? its chief executive Jeremy King and other shareholders had declined. Minor had âno other viable option than to appoint administratorsï¿½? King, who founded Corbin & King with the purchase of the Wolseley in 2003 with his partner Chris Corbin, quoted Romantic poet William Blake when speaking to the Financial Times in response to the news: âA truth that is told with bad intent beats all the lies you can invent.ï¿½?âThere is absolutely no need to go into administration, we are trading extremely well,ï¿½?he added. Corbin and King are renowned restaurateurs having made their name at the high-end London venues The Ivy and Le Caprice. Corbin & King restaurants have counted the pop star Victoria Beckham and actor Robert Downey Jr among their guests, while the artist Lucian Freud dined at the Wolseley most nights before his death in 2011. A source close to the restaurateurâs management said, however, that Minor had offered cash to the company only in return for King relinquishing his board position and shareholding. Minor said that it could not comment on Kingâs position but that it had offered âa number of commercially attractive expansion proposalsï¿½?that King had blocked. In a bid to oust Minor, Corbin & King has been holding talks overÂ financing with US-based investment fund Knighthead Capital Management. The negotiations were first reported by Sky News. FRP Advisory, the administrators appointed by Minor, were aware of Knightheadâs interest in the business, the person close to Corbin & King said. It is the second time the group has discussed financial backing with the little-known Knighthead, which recently reaped the rewards of the car rental firm Hertzâs emergence from bankruptcy. It initially held talks with the investment firm in 2017 before Minor bought the majority shareholding from the private equity group Graphite Capital. The appointment of administrators comes on the same day that Corbin & King was in court suing the insurer Axa to cover losses it incurred during repeated pandemic lockdowns. The two-day case is being closely watched by other companies considering their own legal action against insurers on business interruption policies after lockdowns from March 2020 forced pubs and restaurants to close and unable to access their premises. The High Court is being asked to examine the scope of Corbin & Kingâs so-called denial of access insurance cover ï¿½?which compensates companies if their venues are shut by a statutory body because of a local âdangerï¿½?ï¿½?and whether Corbin & Kingâs claims are limited to just Â£250,000 payable by Axa in respect of all premises ï¿½?or whether there is a limit of Â£250,000 for each set of premises, as Corbin & King contends. Stonegate, owner of the Slug and Lettuce and Walkabout chains, is suing three insurers MS Amlin, Liberty Mutual and Zurich ï¿½?for a total of Â£845m in a dispute over the extent of its insurance coverage for pandemic-linked losses."
278,1,Tech giant GoTo faces tough tests after strong debut on share market,870 words,South China Morning Post,"GoTo Group was formed by a merger of two home-grown Indonesian firms ï¿½?GoJek, which provided on-demand services from rides to payments, and e-commerce leader Tokopedia. Li, the son of Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing, has a US$900 million stake in GoTo Group. He invested in Tokopedia in 2017, one of his first major bets to grow his empire in Southeast Asia. GoTo, which mainly focuses on serving the Indonesian market, raised US$1.1 billion with shares priced at 338 rupiah (18 HK cents), making it Asia's largest and the world's fifth-largest IPO this year. GoTo's debut was stronger than those of its competitors, namely Singapore-based ride-hailing app Grab, which was listed on the Nasdaq exchange in December last year. The stock price of another competitor, New York-listed gaming and e-commerce giant Sea, also headquartered in Singapore, has also languished. Both Grab and Sea, which focus on Southeast Asia, have lost around US$71 billion combined on the markets so far this year. ""Listing locally, in the home market, has a benefit because the investors here understand. They walk on the street, they look out of their window, and they see a Gojek helmet. On Wall Street, [the investors'] only taste of the company is through an analytical report that somebody gives them,"" said Vinnie Lauria, founding partner at Southeast Asia focused-venture capital firm Golden Gate Ventures in Singapore, which is a small shareholder at GoTo. ""But I do think it'd be too soon to say this is hands down a better job for GoTo,"" said Lauria, though he added that for a local listing, GoTo's debut clearly came out ahead of Grab and Sea. He now expects GoTo to pursue a dual listing in the United States. Local retail investors ï¿½?who count themselves among the legion of GoTo's fans ï¿½?have voiced their sense of pride at buying into the future of two household names. GoTo's constituent companies started out small ï¿½?Gojek was originally a 20-fleet motorcycle taxi-booking operation in 2010. Tokopedia, which started in 2009, was co-founded by William Tanuwijaya, an Indonesian-Chinese entrepreneur with a rural background who used to work night shifts at an internet cafe to pay for his college tuition. The 40-year-old drew inspiration from the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Alibaba's Jack Ma to get his business off the ground. More than a decade on, both firms boast more than 2.5 million registered driver partners and more than 14 million merchants on their platforms, whose combined ecosystem contributed 2 per cent of Indonesia's US$1.1 trillion economy, according to the company's claims. While the e-commerce sector is led by several unicorns ï¿½?or companies valued at above US$1 billion ï¿½?Southeast Asia's largest digital economy still offers plenty of room for growth as online spending is expected to rise to US$146 billion in 2025, a jump from US$70 billion last year. Still, GoTo's fortunes cannot be determined by its first week. E-commerce firm Bukalapak, Indonesia's largest listing when it debuted last year and raised US$1.5 billion, has seen its stock fall by 60 per cent since last August. Geopolitical dynamics and global economic developments were also likely to have an impact on the stocks' movement in the near future, Li said. ""Bukalapak had a challenge that it was only the fourth-largest player in a highly competitive market. Grab and Sea for the last four months have been under the perfect storm of inflation, interest-rate hike and macro geopolitical uncertainties,"" Li said. GoTo is also not profitable yet and reported a net loss equivalent to US$806 million for the first nine months last year. Analysts predict that GoTo's main challenge following its IPO is to overcome investors' scepticism about its business model. Singapore-based fintech-focused consulting firm Kapronasia said in a note last week that the ""struggles"" of super-app firms could not simply be put down to poor sentiment around the Russian invasion or high inflation. ""The problem lies in their business models, which seek to create one-size-fits-all solutions that users do not necessarily want, and that are built upon questionable foundations,"" it wrote. ""How much time do people spend in a ride-hailing and food-delivery app? Where is the link from those services to banking?"" The consultancy firm noted that Gojek's acquisition of a small Indonesian bank, Bank Jago, in 2020 could help it become ""a stronger digibanking player"" than Grab and Sea."

837,0,US radio sets out to break Russian 'propaganda wall',644 words,Agence France Presse,"These days, it still broadcasts in 27 languages -- including Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian -- to 23 countries, many where media freedoms face severe restrictions. It has more than 200 journalists in Ukraine and plays a major role in covering the looming conflict on the Ukrainian border, according to Kiryl Sukhotski, regional director for Europe and TV production. ""Our role is to provide objective and impartial information from both sides of the conflict to our audiences. We're a surrogate broadcaster and we don't take sides,"" Sukhotski said in an interview. ""We are penetrating the wall of Russian propaganda."" The West has repeatedly accused Russia of spreading disinformation to justify its cause, while Russia says the Western view of the crisis is distorted. Most recently, the Russian foreign ministry slammed as ""nonsense"" and ""provocative"" reports from Britain about Moscow planning to install a pro-Russian leader in Kyiv. RFE/RL, which has a target audience of 37 million people, stepped up activities in the region following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the occupation of eastern Ukraine by pro-Moscow rebel forces. It launched the Current Time TV channel in Russian, as well as programmes targeting audiences in the Donbass and Crimea regions. The radio station's journalists -- staff and freelancers alike -- face constant threats from Russian and rebel authorities. Some have already ended up in prison, such as Vladyslav Yesypenko, who is facing 15 years in jail on espionage charges. Their coverage methods vary, from on-the-ground reporting to journalism based on open sources. Last week, an RFE/RL journalist gave an account of how Russian troops are gathering on the Ukrainian border by following scores of TikTok accounts. ""Soldiers were sharing TikTok videos of how they go towards the border, and then there were hundreds of comments saying, 'Oh, my son is going there', or 'My son is on that train', or 'My boyfriend is there',"" said Sukhotski. ""And we started talking to their families posting those comments and suddenly this whole picture of dozens of thousands of troops moving to Belarus, towards the Ukrainian border, we were able to do it just by looking at TikTok accounts,"" he added. Funded by the US Congress, RFE/RL is also setting out to battle what it says is Russian disinformation. ""We are creating a new unit in Kyiv that will do same-day rapid reactions to fake news, disinfo, propaganda -- just saying OK, this is true, this is not true,"" Sukhotski said. ""Russia very quickly understood that it is not necessary to lie to make successful propaganda. All you need is to withhold context and create white noise. ""Our task is to present the context and for our audiences to make their own decisions, and this is what the Russian authorities perceive as a threat,"" he added. Recalling Moscow's attempts to jam RFE/RL broadcasts during the Cold War, Sukhotski said variety was key. The radio is present on Facebook, Twitter, and also on Russian social media including VKontakte and Odnoklassniki. ""The whole digital landscape is changing fast and if we are not changing with it, we will be left behind,"" he said. ""You can block a website but it would be very difficult to block Facebook or YouTube. Russia is not yet there."" ""It is the beauty of social media that can get us there despite any attempts by the authorities to block us."" frj/dt/bp"

534,0,Credit card utilisation stays lower than pre-Covid levels,656 words,Financial Express Online,"âWe had cut limits, but that was a temporary thing and we went back to normal in a matter of months. But yes, consumption is still low and utilisation may be low for that reason,ï¿½?said a senior executive with a large private bank. In a call with investors after its Q3FY22 results, credit cards market leader HDFC Bank admitted that even as spends have been trending up, utilisation of limits remains a problem. Srinivasan Vaidyanathan, chief financial officer, said until recently, the bank was tight on the credit limits. âThe credit line utilisation is at a low. So, while the spend levels are up 24% and the interchange is quite robust and good with a good yield that we get on that, the credit line utilisation has got much more to do to get back to the pre-pandemic level.ï¿½?As a result of poor utilisation and a tighter policy on credit limits, HDFC Bankâs fee income from payments products and credit cards declined on a year-on-year basis in the December quarter. In addition, the tendency to revolve card balances also waned, with HDFC Bank still at about 70-80% of the pre-Covid levels in terms of revolving balances on cards. In a recent report, analysts at KIE wrote utilisation rates have dropped in nearly all the segments of credit cards across limit ticket sizes. Growth has been slow in all the top states where credit cards have been issued and was stronger outside of metropolitan markets. âThe sharp drop in spending as well as repayment by card holders could explain the drop in utilisation rate,ï¿½?the report said, adding, âWhile the urban markets were less impacted by Covid, it does appear that bankers were cautious, especially as the high credit penetrated market saw the slowest growth in cards issued, growth in limits and outstanding.ï¿½?Worsening consumer confidence is also taking a toll on spending preferences. A recent report by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said the pandemic severely dented consumer confidence which reached historic lows as the repercussions of Covid-19 unfolded. A majority of the respondents in all rounds of the RBIâs consumer confidence survey reported higher prices and inflation compared with a year ago. âA general perception of high prices and rising inflation further aggravated the situation for consumers already worried by the employment scenario and general economy,ï¿½?the report said, adding that consumers aggressively cut down on non-essential spending after the pandemic broke out. KIE expects credit card spends to pick up as conditions normalise and lenders on-board customers at a quicker pace. âAs more spend categories come back on track like international travel or foreign exchange, we should see this book contributing quite well to all leading credit card players,ï¿½?it said.  âThe sharp drop in spending as well as repayment by card holders could explain the drop in utilisation rate,ï¿½?the report said, adding, âWhile the urban markets were less impacted by Covid, it does appear that bankers were cautious, especially as the high credit penetrated market saw the slowest growth in cards issued, growth in limits and outstanding.â[https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-422.jpg]"

854,1,Madison Core Laboratories Announces Huntsville Laboratory Expansion,655 words,Business Wire,"Phase 1 of the Huntsville Lab expansion will be the integration of core laboratory services currently being performed in the Madison facility. These services include chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis testing. By integrating these laboratory services into the Huntsville location, MCL will be able to achieve greater efficiencies and provide its clients and patients with expanded high-quality testing with faster turnaround times. The expanded laboratory footprint allowed for the immediate addition of several new instrumentation systems. Further automated instrumentation platforms will be added in the coming months. This phase will also provide a new and larger area for specimen receipt, accessioning and processing, and more space to support growth of the Company's onsite phlebotomy services. Current facility development also underway is the addition of administrative offices and a new streamlined laboratory storage system. ""Having our core laboratory team under the same roof as our molecular, microbiology, and toxicology teams will also provide a better work environment for our employees that supports greater communication, increased team collaboration, and opportunities for cross training, and sharing collective intelligence. An added benefit is that our mobile phlebotomy team and courier services will now have a single specimen drop off site instead of multiple locations. ""Increasing the capacities of our laboratory not only supports our geographic market expansion and testing services growth but with the expanded laboratory facility, MCL is positioned to participate in additional research and development opportunities as we will have research space and are near the Cummings Research Park,"" Crespo stated. Phase 1 of the Huntsville Lab expansion and Madison integration will be completed by the end of April. Phase II, the addition of administrative offices, is to be finalized by mid-to-late summer 2022. MCL started patient testing in January 2016 in its Madison, Alabama location with a focus on meeting the laboratory needs dedicated to the elderly and long-term care patients. The Company acquired a pharmacogenomics lab in Huntsville in 2018 to expand its lab test menu, and quickly pivoted to comprehensive pathogen detection using state-of-the-art molecular technologies. Over the past three years, MCL has rapidly become a major local/regional laboratory through diverse test offering. Madison Core Laboratories would like to thank the City of Madison for supporting a small business during its growth and looks forward to continuing to serve its community from the Huntsville Lab location at 2705 Artie Street SW in Huntsville, Alabama. Construction and move activities are planned to ensure no disruption in testing services will occur. About Madison Core Laboratories Madison Core Laboratories is one of the leading independent laboratories in Alabama. We provide extensive laboratory services using state-of-the art testing equipment to provide our clients with the latest innovations in the laboratory spectrum.

676,0,KREMLIN-BACKED RT BRANDS CALL FOR OFCOM REVIEW 'HYPOCRITICAL' IN SWIPE AT BBC,1015 words,Press Association National Newswire,"But RT has responded, accusing the Government of a ""hypocritical"" stance after ministers criticised China's decision to ban the BBC World Service last year. It comes after Tory MP for High Peak Robert Largan warned that he would be ""cautious"" about banning RT due to potential reprisals against the BBC. He said on Twitter: ""Putin would respond by banning the BBC in Russia, which actually cuts through his propaganda to millions."" He suggested RT was mostly ignored by those in the UK. In her letter to Ofcom, Nadine Dorries said certain states sought to ""exploit and undermine"" the UK's media landscape. She said RT's editor-in-chief had ""made clear in the past"" that the station supported the Kremlin's aims, by calling the broadcaster an ""information weapon"" of the Russian state. Ms Dorries said: ""It is essential that the UK looks to limit Russia's ability to spread their propaganda at home. ""I have concerns that broadcasters such as RT, whom Ofcom have found to have repeatedly breached the Broadcasting Code in the past, will also look to spread harmful disinformation about the ongoing crisis in Ukraine here in the UK."" She said this was ""something RT has previously done in its biased reporting of the Salisbury poisonings and the conflict in Syria"". Ms Dorries said that although it was a matter for Ofcom to rule on, due to the regulator's independence, she welcomed comments suggesting complaints were being taken seriously, and said: ""I call on you to ensure your actions are timely and transparent to reassure the British public."" In a response, Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told Ms Dorries the regulator had ""already stepped up our oversight of coverage of these events by broadcasters in the UK"". She said while broadcasters can cover issues from a ""particular perspective"" as long as balance is achieved, that ""it would not be acceptable for any of our licensees to broadcast one-sided propaganda"". The move was branded ""hypocritical"" by RT reporter Shadia Edwards-Dashti. Speaking on the news channel, she said it was ""simply not good enough for the Government"" that Ofcom was keeping an eye on RT and instead ""the Government wants to see this channel taken off air"". She said it was a ""slippery slope, specifically about freedom of speech"", and added: ""Is this an issue of state sponsorship? Because if it is an issue of state sponsorship, then we have to look at the BBC - that too is sponsored by the state."" She said: ""Just to mention, last year when China banned the BBC World Service, that was early last year in 2021, the UK Government slammed that move as an unacceptable curtailing of media freedom. ""They were the headlines at the time, so it does seem somewhat hypocritical at this point."" The BBC is a public service broadcaster and it has editorial independence. Anna Belkina, RT's deputy editor-in-chief, said in a statement: ""RT's operational and editorial independence from all governments is legally protected and always has been. ""Ofcom recognises this and has long-endorsed RT as a licence holder. Even in the face of undue political pressure it has continuously found RT to be in line with other UK broadcasters, without a single breach of Broadcasting Code to be found in the last four years - not something that can be said about many other channels in the country. ""Yet UK politicians are now openly and brazenly interfering in institutions they have long touted as supposedly independent and wholly free from political pressure, exposing their self-proclaimed commitment to such values as free speech and regulatory independence as nothing but a sham."" Downing Street said Ofcom had been asked to keep a ""watchful eye"" on RT. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said it was Ofcom's role to regulate the media and ""that's not something we would want to see politicians decide"". Asked whether Boris Johnson would advise his father not to appear again on the channel, the spokesman said: ""Obviously that's a matter for individuals who appear to make that decision."" In the Commons, in response to a call from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer for RT to be taken to task, Mr Johnson said: ""We live in a democracy, Mr Speaker, and we live in a country that believes in free speech and I think it's important that we should leave it up to Ofcom rather than to politicians to decide which media organisations to ban. ""That's what Russia does."" Sir Keir said RT was President Vladimir Putin's ""personal propaganda tool"" which spread ""lies and disinformation"", and added: ""I can see no reason why it should be allowed to continue to broadcast in this country."" Sir Keir said he was ""very glad to hear that that review is now happening"". A Labour spokesperson later said it had been the party's policy ""for a number of years"" that their MPs did not appear on the channel, and any that did ""certainly have never done so supported by the Labour Party or facilitated by the Labour press office or anything like that"". Asked if a ""quiet word"" was had with any Labour MPs who did appear, he said: ""I think it depends on the individual."" He added: ""I think there's a pretty clear view on the position towards Russia Today and you've seen other countries like Germany take action on it."" Earlier, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told Sky News: ""I think it is certainly true that (RT) is spouting propaganda on behalf of the Kremlin."""
659,0,Sky News employees caught in cyber breach,425 words,The Sydney Morning Herald - Online,"A letter, seen by this masthead, apologised for the breach, but it is unclear how many employees were affected. ""While we have received no reports from Frontier that any of this information has been published online or any other unwanted or harmful behaviour, we think it is important to let you know about this so that you can take steps to protect this information and we would like to apologise to you that this may have happened,"" the letter said. Sky News was approached for comment but did not respond before deadline. The letters were sent weeks after Frontier Software informed Nine Entertainment Co, owner of this masthead, that about 500 current and former employees had their personal payroll details stolen. Frontier initially told Nine Radio, which runs 2GB, 3AW and 4BC, that no personal information of its employees had been released, but changed its view after further analysis. The data accessed included full names, home and email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, tax file numbers, salaries, payroll IDs and superannuation fund details. Sky News said the details could include full names and bank account numbers. Sky News no longer uses Frontier as its payroll provider. Research from McGrath Nicol late last year showed that ransomware attacks are becoming a big problem for Australian executives, with 35 per cent of companies having suffered a ransomware attack and 83 per cent of those businesses paying a ransom. The use of ransomware on Australian business led to the creation of a new taskforce by the Australian Federal Police, which allows it to fight more effectively again crime groups operating within Australia and overseas. The federal government last year announced a ransomware action plan with more funding for security officials to go after criminal gangs. It also introduced legislation that requires companies hit by ransomware to report to the Australian Cyber Security Centre, part of the Australian Signals Directorate. Nine, the owner of this masthead, was hit by a ransomware attack last March.

811,0,Brazil's Bolsonaro tweets support for podcaster Rogan,296 words,Agence France Presse,"""I'm not sure what @joerogan thinks about me or about my government, but it doesn't matter. If freedom of speech means anything, it means that people should be free to say what they think, no matter if they agree or disagree with us,"" Bolsonaro wrote. ""Stand your ground! Hugs from Brazil."" Rogan is at the center of an entertainment-world storm after several music superstars, including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, ditched Spotify over its handling of Rogan's controversial statements on Covid-19 vaccines. Rogan, an ex-martial arts champ turned hugely popular talk show host, has discouraged Covid-19 vaccination in young people and promoted the off-label use of the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin to treat the disease. Facing a spreading backlash, Spotify announced Sunday it would start guiding podcast listeners toward factual information on the pandemic. But it has not cut ties with Rogan, whose show, ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" has been broadcast exclusively on the platform since 2020, under a deal worth an estimated $100 million. The podcast draws 11 million listeners per episode on average. Bolsonaro has himself questioned Covid-19 vaccines, joking they could ""turn you into an alligator,"" and touted treatments such as anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine despite research showing they are ineffective against the disease. mel/jhb/dw"
973,1,ABP Publishing Increased Sales by 30 % in 2021 Thereby Continuing the 7 Years Growth Trend Line,433 words,Business Wire,"""Almost all our calculations for 2021 turned out to be exact. We had counted on Turkish and Italian markets and got it right. In the latter one we sold twice more audiobooks than the year before, - says Viktoria Salnikova, Chief Editor. -- It can be called solid growth. Sales in Germany rose 19,3 % which I think, too, is a quite impressive result considering the highly competitive book market in the country"". Strong performance in one of the biggest European book markets was achieved with the aid of fruitful cooperation with new distributors in German-speaking countries. ABP Publishing expands the net of its partners in distribution and sells audiobooks not only in pay-per-download but also in a streaming model. The management of the company is sure of the wisdom of the decision as more and more users take interest in subscriptions for different services including listening to audiobooks. As for France, the prognosis and results were not congruent as the target growth records were not achieved there. Nevertheless, French users continue consuming audiobooks on the same level as in 2020. The company has set ambitious plans for 2022. The retention and growth are planned to be executed thanks to vast marketing activity. Particularly, the company is going to pay more attention to advertising campaigns on social networks and cooperate with influencers in different fields. Also, some joint activities with authors are planned. ""We consider audiobooks to be an underestimated product on a market, - says Andrey Mishenev, CEO. -- Printed versions are massively discussed and presented before publishing whereas an audiobook is seen as just a by-product. Nevertheless, I believe an audiobook can be promoted as a standalone product. We involve highly professional voice-overs in production who can create not just a book but a genuine object of art. And I hold it good to carry to our listeners"". About ABP Publishing ABP Publishing is a publisher of non-fiction digital-only audiobooks in different languages.

6,0,Palmer launches lofty pitch for share of nation's disaffected voters,720 words,The Age - Online,"""The message for Australians is, if you're happy with everything that's been done now, if you think it's sufficient, if it's enough for you and your family, then vote again for Scott Morrison,"" Palmer told the crowd of about 1100 packed into one of the compound's conference spaces. ""But if you really care about our country ï¿½?you must vote for the United Australia Party."" The UAP is again going big in its attempt to carve out a share of the nation's disaffected voters from the likes of fellow Queenslander Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, both of which are running candidates in almost all lower and upper house contests. After being ferried from the car park in golf carts, supporters and candidates sat in darkness - illuminated by a big-screen replay of Palmer's recent National Press Club speech - while they awaited the duo's arrival. Songs from a cover band, including Tracy Chapman's Talkin' bout a Revolution, and a video reel of policy sound bites laced with calls to ""save Australia"" and ""save your life"" followed. The party chairman, one-term federal MP and billionaire mining magnate - undeterred by a fall during Friday's rehearsals - entered to a raucous welcome before kicking off with the party's major populist policies, several of which have had questions raised over their effectiveness, or even feasibility. Kelly, who is trying to retain his NSW seat of Hughes after switching party allegiances, was then introduced as ""Australia's next prime minister"", in an echo of ubiquitous newspaper ads. He took the podium and touched further on the party's proposed bill of rights, ban on lockdowns, and abolition of national cabinet. ""We must save Australians from what is coming after the election,"" he said. ""They will lock us down again."" Kelly then railed against the ""Labor and Liberal coalition"" to boos and jeers. A few shouts of ""sack them"" and ""jail them"" also rose from the crowd. At a later press conference, Palmer and Kelly brushed off questions about plans to seemingly repeat the party's 2019 advertising spend - dubbed ""dangerous"" by a former Appeal Court judge - and failure to win a single seat with about 3.4 per cent of the national vote. ""I don't think you can compare this election campaign with the last one,"" Kelly said. Palmer suggested it was ""not about how much money you spend ... it's irrelevant. The election is about what you can do for the Australian people"". Palmer is vying with Hanson and former Liberal National Party premier turned-Liberal Democrat Campbell Newman for what is expected to be, at most, two of the six Senate seats in a race that also includes the third-placed LNP candidate, Assistant Minister to the Attorney-General Amanda Stoker. The latest Resolve Political Monitor, conducted for this masthead in early April, found combined support for UAP and One Nation totalled just 5 per cent nationwide. Despite the tens of millions of dollars already poured into his campaign, Palmer's party managed just 2 per cent of the surveyed primary vote intention in Queensland, compared to the 5 per cent share of Hanson's 25-year-old populist right-wing political vehicle. The Greens sat at 14 per cent. Beyond their broad anti-major party sentiment, neither Kelly nor Palmer would be drawn on where they might suggest voters park preferences. ""We are in this with a good chance,"" Kelly said. Jacqueline Maley cuts through the noise of the federal election campaign with news, views and expert analysis.

25,0,Toronto restaurant Soufi's closes its doors permanently,557 words,The Toronto Star,"âOur mom has been sick for a year and a half. We tried to make it through the pandemic but with the no-mask rule, itâs too risky,ï¿½?said Alaa Alsoufi on Sunday. âPlus, weâre tired, we need to breathe a bit.ï¿½?Mask mandates were dropped in most circumstances provincewide in late March, relieving some pressure on small businesses. But for the Alsoufi family, it made for a well-ordered exit. âWe were actually trying to reach this point, we wanted this to happen in the turning point, not when things were less certain. We were just trying to at least reach this point, itâs been hard,ï¿½?Alaa said. Founded by the Alsoufi family, the Toronto eatery has been praised as a refugee resettlement program success story. After arriving in Canada, the Alsoufis noticed there wasnât much in terms of Syrian food throughout the city, prompting them to start their own restaurant. Missing from Torontoâs kaleidoscopic cuisine were knafeh and manaeesh. So the family decided to fill that gap, much to their customersï¿½?delight. âThis was a wonderful place, the food is delicious, the owners are lovely people,ï¿½?said Akash Swar, a customer whoâs patronized Soufiâs since it first opened. âIt was really nice to have this community here and have the city get introduced to Syrian food. This is something I grew up eating back in Dubai, so its close to my heart.ï¿½?âIâm happy that they had that opportunity to share their culture and food with people here because I feel like Toronto is such a diverse city and it gives you that opportunity to explore your options and put something new out there.ï¿½?Another customer, Josh Chernofsky, lamented the changing nature of Torontoâs streets as businesses like Soufiâs close. âIt seems Queen Street and a lot of streets in general are losing their character and it includes the loss of this,ï¿½?Chernofsky said. âNothing seems to be changing for the better in the city.ï¿½?Although Soufiâs is closing, Alaa points out there are other Syrian restaurants sprouting up in and around the GTA. âThereâs a bunch of different places, mostly in Mississauga,and there is one on Yonge and Eglinton.ï¿½?The restaurant has made headlines in the past. In 2019, Soufiâs closed temporarily after their son was a target for death threats following a political protest. Now that Soufiâs is closing on its own terms, Jala Alsoufi considers it a bittersweet moment. âThis is a project me and my family worked on really hard for five years, but now we want to focus a bit more on our family,ï¿½?Jala said. âTo take care of each other and weâre really happy with what weâve done.ï¿½?âWeâre proud of this. Weâre proud of this space and we love our customers. Itâs just time for us to close.ï¿½?Demar Grant is a Toronto-based staff reporter for the Star. Reach Demar via email: dgrant@torstar.ca"
202,0,"McDonald's , Starbucks to Close Russian Locations -- Update",932 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"McDonald's and Starbucks 's chief executives told employees in separate messages Tuesday that the moves were motivated by the invasion of Ukraine. U.S. companies have been reassessing their operations in Russia after Western governments have sanctioned Russia in response to its military action, and financial firms acted to sever Russia from global markets. The restaurant companies' moves halt operations that have generated years of sales, serving millions of customers daily in a food-service market estimated to be worth billions of dollars. They are also a symbolic gesture by global brands that have in recent decades represented the opening of the Russian economy to Western-style business and products. Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month has built pressure on restaurant operators to follow steps by other major companies, including Apple Inc ., Boeing Co . and BP PLC , to reconsider their Russian ties. Since the invasion began, more than 250 U.S. technology firms, manufacturers and other companies have announced their withdrawal from Russia, according to the Yale School of Management. New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli , who oversees the state's public pension fund investments including McDonald's shares, had called on the company to review its Russian business to serve the best interests of the company and its shareholders, among them the New York State Common Retirement Fund . Online petitions have circulated on social media in recent days, calling for McDonald's and other U.S. restaurant chains to pull out of Russia.  McDonald's owns and operates 84% of its restaurants in Russia, with the rest run by franchisees, the chain said. The company said that both company and franchised restaurants will temporarily shut down in the country. McDonald's said it couldn't yet tell when it might reopen the restaurants in Russia, and would consider whether any additional steps might be required. Russia and Ukraine accounted for around 9% of McDonald's revenue last year, the company said, given the high percentage of company-owned restaurants in those markets. The countries accounted for 2% of overall sales, and less than 3% of operating income, the chain said.  McDonald's also owns and operates 108 restaurants in Ukraine, along with corporate offices, employing nearly 10,000 people. Those locations are closed, and the company is working to maintain its payroll system in the country to keep paying employees, McDonald's said in an internal message last week.  Starbucks didn't specify when its Russia operations may restart. Other American restaurant chains are continuing to operate in Russia. A Yum Brands Inc. spokeswoman said Tuesday that the company had suspended all investment and restaurant development in Russia, but that its KFC and Pizza Hut locations there continue to operate. The company has nearly 1,000 KFC restaurants and 50 Pizza Hut locations in Russia, nearly all of which are operated by independent owners under license or franchise agreements, Yum said. A Restaurant Brands International Inc . spokeswoman said the company's more than 800 Burger King restaurants remain open in Russia, as they are stand-alone businesses owned and operated by local franchisees. ""We have longstanding legal agreements that are not easily changeable in the foreseeable future,"" she said. In recent days, calls to boycott McDonald's , Starbucks and other chains still operating in Russia have grown on social media. Oksana Yakushko, a Santa Barbara, Calif.-based psychologist who is Ukrainian, said she started Change.org petitions calling for Starbucks and McDonald's to close their Russian locations because they struck her as more tangible than sanctions. ""Russia and Russians should not stay unaware or afraid to take responsibility for this war,"" said Ms. Yakushko, who said her immediate family had just escaped Ukraine, though other relatives remain. Some past efforts to pull back in response to geopolitical tensions have drawn rebukes from the Russian government. In 2014, amid rising tension over Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region, McDonald's closed a handful of restaurants operating there. In subsequent days, Russia's consumer regulator began shutting down or inspecting McDonald's restaurant locations, including the country's iconic first McDonald's restaurant that opened in Pushkin Square in 1990. The closures were temporary.  McDonald's first began eyeing the Russian market in the late 1970s, and it took repeated discussions with government officials to provide food for the 1980 Moscow Olympics and, later, open restaurants in the country. Running restaurants there involved extensive approvals from the Russian government. Some of McDonald's Russian locations eventually became among the chain's top-performing stores.  Pizza Hut , then owned by PepsiCo. Inc ., entered Russia soon after the first McDonald's opened.

681,0,NY Times tones down claims in its hit Trojan Horse podcast,619 words,The Daily Telegraph,"The series, which is one of the most downloaded podcasts on Apple iTunes and Spotify, promises to tell the true story of how an alleged plot by hardline Islamists to take over state schools in Birmingham in 2014 prompted a national inquiry. But the podcast's creators have been accused of presenting a ""misleading picture"" of events and exonerating Tahir Alam, the alleged ringleader of the plot who was accused of orchestrating a plan to promote conservative religious teaching in schools. The government ordered an investigation after an anonymous letter, widely accepted at the time as a hoax, was sent to Birmingham council containing claims about an attempt to impose ultra-conservative Islamist views on children in state schools. Mr Alam, the former chairman of governors at Park View, is now banned by the Government from holding any leadership positions in British education after he was found to have undermined ""fundamental British values"". Peter Clarke, an ex-counter-terrorism chief who headed the independent investigation into Trojan Horse, found that under Mr Alam's leadership, Park View ""sought to export its Islamising blueprint"" to other schools. Mr Alam, who alleges that the various inquiries were driven by Islamophobia, was also found by an independent tribunal to be responsible for a number of serious failings across several schools including the failure to keep children safe from extremist views. Several individuals have submitted complaints to The New York Times about their reporting of events, including Richy Thompson of Humanists UK, an organisation that worked closely with whistleblowers to raise concerns at the time. ""We believe the podcast presents a misleading account of our own involvement in these events,"" a spokesman for Humanists UK said. The podcast originally described Mr Thompson as ""dodging"" and ""equivocating"", with the main presenter Brian Reed adding: ""He said at some point, he was in touch with some other people from Park View, but wouldn't tell us how many, what they said."" But following a complaint from Mr Thompson, this section has now been edited to say: ""He said he was in touch with two or three other people from Park View, who shared similar concerns ? who alleged there'd been instances of gender discrimination and homophobia at the school. And he said as time went on he felt the allegations were corroborated by other reporting."" A note with the correction appears on The New York Times's webpage about the series although it is not highlighted in the audio itself nor is it featured on the various podcast apps. Colin Diamond, a professor of educational leadership at Birmingham University who was parachuted into Birmingham Council to turn schools around in wake of the Trojan Horse scandal, claimed that the podcast is ""unethical"" and ""one-sided"". A spokesman for The New York Times said: ""Brian Reed and Hamza Syed spent more than three years rigorously reporting on the Trojan Horse affair to expose the truth. Their reporting is fair and accurate and the leadership of The New York Times stands behind it. ""We hope listeners will take time to engage with the reporting and the facts the series has revealed."" A government spokesman said: ""We make no apology for working to protect young people from all forms of harm. All children, from whatever background and no matter what challenges they face, deserve a safe environment in which they can learn."""
41,0,Award-winning Brisbane restaurant in shock closure,329 words,Courier Mailï¿½?- âOnline,"Though loved by critics, Gauge had been struggling financially for the past two years during Covid, initially closing its doors when the pandemic hit and then running gourmet takeaway on and off between sporadic trading. Owner Jerome Batten, who is also behind acclaimed bar Maker around the corner in Fish Lane, had been trying to find a buyer for the business and was in talks with landlord Aria Property Group to try to exit his lease early. After lengthy negotiations, the property group agreed to terminate the lease last month. âIt was obvious it (the lease) was going to come to an end, so we just ruled a line under it at that juncture and brought it forward,ï¿½?Ariaâs Michael Zaicek said. A new tenant has already been secured for the 78sq m site, which Mr Zaicek revealed would be a high calibre lunch and dinner restaurant due to open around September. Mr Batten did not return The Courier-Mailâs calls for comment. Meanwhile, at Woolloongabba, hugely popular American-style eatery Mac From Way Back also announced it has closed permanently. The venue, which blossomed from a beloved food truck business, had been struggling to find staff at the beginning of the year making it impossible to keep regular trading hours and operate with any type of normalcy. Owner Dane Coote opened the burger restaurant in the âGabbaâs Logan Rd food precinct in 2020 and it quickly became a hit with foodies and Instagrammers across the city.

688,0,"This took a few hours to make': Instagram scam offers users gift, then steals their account via linked website",424 words,The Straits Times,"In cases seen by The Straits Times, users first receive a message from a follower with a compromised account claiming he has a gift for them. The message usually says: ""This took a few hours to make. I hope you love it."" The contents of these gifts are never specified. The message comes with a personalised link directing them to a separate website that includes the receivers' username, tricking them into believing the link was crafted especially for them. Shortly after, swindlers gain access to the user's account and use it to broadcast a similar scam message to other followers, who in turn may be deceived into thinking their friends are offering them a gift. A similar line of Instagram scams was reported in overseas media, including British newspaper The Independent, which warned that the login page is a sham that allows hackers to enter users' accounts. It reported: ""There (are) no gifts - and instead, that page will simply steal a user's password, with affected people reporting that they are simply thrown onto an online gambling page at the end."" Hackers will then have access to a user's password, allowing them to send the same message to other users, The Independent wrote. It urged users to take caution before entering passwords on any website. Responding to queries from The Straits Times, a spokesman for Meta, which runs Instagram, urged users to pick strong, unique passwords and never share them with people they do not trust. The spokesman added that users should turn on two-factor authentication in their settings for added security, but did not provide further details on the scam. She pointed to an advisory under Meta that warns users not to trust messages that offer gifts, demand for money or threaten to delete their account, and to promptly report such cases to Instagram or Facebook, which Meta also operates.

618,0,"Russia backs jail time for 'fake' army news, restricts media",650 words,Agence France Presse,"""If the fakes led to serious consequences, (the legislation) threatens imprisonment of up to 15 years,"" Russia's lower house of parliament said. Amendments were also passed to fine or jail anybody calling for sanctions against Russia. Opening the parliament's session, chairman Vyacheslav Volodin railed against foreign social media, after Facebook was briefly inaccessible in Russia on Friday. ""All these IT companies beginning with Instagram, and ending with the others, are based in the United States of America. It is clear they are used as weapons. They carry hatred and lies. We need to oppose this,"" he said. The past year has seen an unprecedented crackdown on independent and critical voices in Russia that has intensified since the invasion. Russia's media watchdog said Friday it had restricted access to the BBC and other independent media websites, further tightening controls over the internet. Access to the BBC, the independent news website Meduza, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, and the Russian-language website of the US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Svoboda, were ""limited"" by Roskomnadzor following a request from prosecutors.  Roskomnadzor said in each case, the request was filed on February 24, the day Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his attack on Ukraine. Valery Fadeyev, the head of the Kremlin's human rights council accused Western media of being behind ""a huge flow of false information that comes from Ukraine"" and said the council had set up a project to stop it. In another attack on critical voices, Russian police on Friday were carrying out searches at the office of the country's most prominent rights group, Memorial, which was ordered to close late last year, sparking international outcry. Russia's invasion has already claimed hundreds of lives, displaced more than a million people and spurred allegations of war crimes. Western-led sanctions levelled against Russia in retaliation have sent the ruble into free-fall forcing the central bank to impose a 30-percent tax on sales of hard currency after a run on lenders. Moscow has few economic tools with which to respond but the duma on Friday adopted a bill that would freeze any assets inside Russia of foreigners ""violating rights of Russians"". Russian media have been instructed to publish only information provided by official sources, which describe the invasion as a military operation. State-controlled broadcasters have meanwhile reinforced government narratives about nationalism in Ukraine and Moscow's claim that Ukrainian soldiers are using civilians as human shields. For the moment, it appears the invasion has marked the beginning of the end for what remains of Russia's independent media. Ekho Mosvky -- a liberal-leaning radio station majority-owned by Russia's energy giant Gazprom -- said Thursday it would shut down after being taken off air over its Ukraine war coverage. Authorities had on Monday blocked the Ekho website and took the station off air as punishment for spreading ""deliberately false information"" about the conflict. Another independent outlet, Znak, said Friday it was ceasing work ""due to the large number of restrictions that have recently appeared for the work of the media in Russia"". The BBC said this week that the audience of its Russian language news website had ""more than tripled...with a record reach of 10.7 million people in the last week"". In a Friday response to the blocking, a BBC spokesperson said the company will ""continue our efforts to make BBC News available in Russia, and across the rest of the world"" despite the restrictions. bur/bp"
474,0,Eateries' plea for more aid,186 words,New York Post,"""After two years of closures, COVID-19 variants, worker shortages, and inflationary pressure, a dangerous number of restaurants are at the end of the line,"" the National Restaurant Association wrote. ""The RRF was a critical lifeline to many, but far more remain on the sidelines, desperately looking for support amid continued economic uncertainty."" ""The decisions you make in the coming weeks will be critical to the future of the nation's restaurant industry,"" the letter added. A new wave of federal grants ""will save more than 1.6 million restaurant jobs,"" said the National Restaurant Association. The survey found 96 percent of restaurateurs who got initial-round grants felt the money increased their odds of staying in business."
638,0,"Facebook used by hackers to target Ukraineâs military and politicians, says Meta",577 words,Evening Standard Online,"Meta said in the last 48 hours it had also separately removed a network of about 40 fake accounts, groups and pages across Facebook and Instagram that operated from Russia and Ukraine targeting people in Ukraine, for violating its rules against coordinated inauthentic behaviour. A Twitter spokesperson said it had also suspended more than a dozen accounts and blocked the sharing of several links for violating its rules against platform manipulation and spam. It said its ongoing investigation indicated the accounts originated in Russia and were attempting to disrupt the public conversation around the conflict in Ukraine. In a blog post on Monday, Meta attributed the hacking efforts to a group known as Ghostwriter, which it said successfully gained access to the targetsï¿½?social media accounts. Meta said the hackers attempted to post YouTube videos from the accounts portraying Ukrainian troops as weakened, including one video which claimed to show Ukrainian soldiers coming out of a forest and flying a white flag of surrender. Ukrainian cybersecurity officials said on Friday that hackers from neighboring Belarus were targeting the private email addresses of Ukrainian military personnel âand related individuals,ï¿½?blaming a group code-named âUNC1151.ï¿½?The US cybersecurity firm FireEye has previously connected the group with Ghostwriter activities. Metaâs security team said it had taken steps to secure targeted accounts and had blocked the phishing domains used by the hackers. It declined to give the names of any of the targets but said it had alerted users where possible. Meta said the separate influence campaign, which used a number of fictitious personas, claimed to be based in Kyiv and ran a small number of websites masquerading as independent news outlets. The company said it had found links between this influence network and an operation it removed in April 2020, which it had connected to individuals in Russia, the Donbass region in Ukraine and two media outlets based in Crimea -NewsFront and SouthFront, which are now sanctioned by the US government. Neither NewsFront or SouthFront immediately responded to requests for comment. Meta declined to give a number of impressions or views for the influence campaignâs content but said it had seen a âvery low levelï¿½?of shares, posts or reactions. It said the campaign had fewer than 4,000 Facebook accounts following one of more of its pages and fewer than 500 accounts following one or more of its Instagram accounts. It did not say how long the campaigns had been active on its platforms. It said the campaign had also used Alphabet Incâs YouTube, Telegram and Russian social media sites Odnoklassniki and VK. YouTube, Telegram and VK, which also owns Odnoklassniki, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The crisis in Ukraine has seen escalating clashes between Moscow and major tech companies. On Friday, Russia said it would partially restrict access to Facebook, a move Meta said came after it refused a government request to stop the independent fact-checking of several Russian state media outlets. On Saturday, Twitter also said its service was being restricted for some Russian users."
529,1,Korean Airâs stock lags US peers' on slow demand recovery,532 words,The Korea Economic Daily Global Edition,"Deltaâs stock jumped 6.21%, extending its gains to 36.23% versus its lows last month. American Airlines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. also soared 10.62% and 7.54%, respectively, on the day. On the other hand, Korean Air rose 0.8% to end at 31,550 won ($25.7) in South Koreaâs main stock market on Thursday, up some 16% from its lows in March. NEED TO CONSULT WITH 170 COUNTRIES The disparity comes as US airlines generate much of their sales from domestic flights, while Korean Air heavily relies on international flights. As of 2019, sales of US airlinesï¿½?domestic flights accounted for about 60% of their total revenues on average. Therefore they can increase sales as long as the authorities don't impose regulations on movement within the country. But Korean Airâs domestic flights made up only 4% of its total sales in the same period. âIn order for international passenger flights to recover to pre-COVID-19 levels, it (Korean Air) needs to consult with about 170 countries that are restricting entries of Koreans,ï¿½?said Kim Young-ho, an analyst at Samsung Securities Co. âIt could take longer than expected to see a recovery in international passenger flight demand.ï¿½?South Korean airlinesï¿½?stocks have been supported since last year on hopes for recovery with countries worldwide opening their borders.[https://www.kedglobal.com/airlines/newsView/ked202203140022]  The combined market capitalization of South Koreaâs five carriers excluding Asiana Airlines that decided on capital reductions in 2020 more than tripled to 13.3 trillion won from 4.4 trillion won in 2019. âIt is hard to explain the increase only with hopes for improvement in their earnings based on the potential international passenger flight recovery,ï¿½?Kim said. CURRENCY, FUEL Surging fuel prices and the softer won are also expected to hurt Korean Air's earnings, analysts said. Meritz Securities predicted Korean Airâs earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) on a separate basis to fall 36.2% this year while forecasting that its operating profit may tumble 75%. Investors, however, continued to hope for an eventual recovery in international passenger flights. âThe recovery of international passenger flight demand for Korean Air will be slower than that for US carriers, but the trend of rising demand is not different,ï¿½?said Jung Yeon-seung, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities. âSo, (Korean Airâs) share price will follow the demand.ï¿½?By Sung-Mi Shim mshim@hankyung.com Jongwoo Cheon edited this article.

Many young Russians have already left or are thinking about escaping as the Russian economy heads for a deep recession, trashing their job prospects. Moscow is on the cusp of its first default on international debts since the Bolshevik revolution[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/03/10/russian-debt-default-would-mean-world/] after last week failing to pay $117m owed to creditors, triggering a 30-day grace period. Officials in Georgia ï¿½?which itself was invaded by Putin in 2008 ï¿½?say that 20,000 to 25,000 Russians have already crossed the border while others are reported to have flooded into Finland, Armenia and Kazakhstan. Armenia estimated last week that 6,000 from Russia and Ukraine are arriving every day. Many of those fleeing have caught wind of rumours the Kremlin will install strict martial law to contain unrest on Russian streets and close the borders to stop an exodus. Citizens are already banned from leaving with more than $10,000 (Â£7,626) in foreign currency. Young Russians speaking to The Telegraph reveal fears of an economy in freefall, a looming crackdown on civil liberties and a return to the darkest days of the Soviet Union. Igor*, a 30-year-old who works in software, says: âI donât think I have a single friend who is not planning to moveï¿½?there is a very noticeable feeling of impending doom in conversations and on social media. Itâs like all hope has been snuffed out.ï¿½?He adds: âThe economy is collapsing. I lived through the 90s as a child and I donât want to repeat that,ï¿½?he says, adding that he wants to move to London as it is a tech hub and a diverse city âwhere my family will not feel like total outsidersï¿½? Losing young workers, particularly your most talented and educated, typically lowers growth, reduces tax revenue, creates staff shortages and rids economies of wealth-creating entrepreneurs. An IMF study found that cumulative GDP growth in eastern Europe would have been seven percentage points higher in real terms between 1995 and 2012 if the region had not suffered high levels of emigration. Madina Khrustaleva, Russia analyst at TS Lombard, says the brain drain will likely reach levels hit in the 1990s when a floundering Russian economy suffered an exodus. She estimates that 500,000 âhighly qualified professionals have left since 2014ï¿½?when the economy struggled, including herself. âThe Government is trying to help IT companies and to prevent youngsters from leaving the country. But thatâs gonna be almost impossible, taking into account what the economy will be able to offer them in the next 10 yearsï¿½?If you are able to leave, you will leave.ï¿½?Russiaâs labour market is already battling high youth unemployment and a declining population. The latest available World Bank data from 2020 suggests 17pc unemployment for those aged between 15 and 24, far higher than the overall figures ï¿½?currently at just above 4pc. Liam Peach, an economist at Capital Economics, says immigrants arriving mostly from post-Soviet states âoffset some of the natural fall in the populationï¿½?in recent years. âBut Russia may find it harder to attract migrants now, while emigration out of Russia may rise. Russia therefore faces a nasty combination of continued weak productivity growth and slow growth of the workforce,ï¿½?he adds. Even before the war, many young Russians were considering leaving[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/03/13/last-exit-moscow-ordinary-russians-desperate-escape-putins-grasp/]. Moscowâs economy has been stuck in stagnation for much of the last eight years following the 2014 oil price crash and sanctions from the Crimea annexation. Last year 48pc of those aged between 18 and 24 said they would like to move abroad permanently, compared to a fifth of all Russians, according to a survey by the independent Levada Centre. It found a tenth of Russians were taking some steps towards leaving. The recent invasion of Ukraine appears to have been the final straw for young talent worried about a return to the Soviet era of scarcity and brutal authoritarianism ï¿½?in stark contrast to the comparative freedom and capitalism they have grown up with. Anna Golikova, a 22-year-old who moved to Denmark from Russia earlier this month, says: âSome people compare this situation to the Soviet Union and how it was back then. â[Many of us] were born after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. For us we never lived in that reality and itâs very scary that we are going back to these times.ï¿½?Anna, who has set up an organisation called Speak Up For Peace that teaches Ukrainian refugees new languages, says younger generations âdonât see any futureï¿½?in Russia and warns the âconsequences will be long term and really affect young people.ï¿½?As the economic outlook deteriorates and the exodus of companies gathers pace, many will hope to follow Luka*, who fled to Greece via Uzbekistan and Turkey after fearing that âmartial law and mass mobilisationï¿½?of Russians to fight are âonly a matter of timeï¿½?

345,0,'People still try to book the famous Steve Coogan/Rob Brydon table',716 words,The Times,"Rogan's restaurant in Cartmel, Cumbria, has just been awarded a third Michelin star, the only restaurant in the UK outside London and Bray in Berkshire (home of the Fat Duck and the Waterside Inn) to win the triple accolade. ""It's absolutely brilliant,"" he says. ""The people from Michelin said they wanted to come and make a video about our sustainability initiatives and ... I was in the kitchen working on a dish when they jumped me with the news. It's what I've dreamt about my whole career. I was just speechless."" Two years ago Rogan was in a very different place. In February that year, while visiting his Hong Kong restaurants Aulis and Roganic, he saw the very first signs of what a pandemic might look like. ""Oh, there was near panic,"" he told me a few months later. ""But never in my wildest dreams did I believe it would come and slap us in the face."" Within weeks the UK was in lockdown and Rogan's business was in crisis. Despite this he began a delivery service, making free ready meals for vulnerable residents in his community. Those who could afford it paid Â£5 for dishes like game sausage with red cabbage and gravy or confit chicken with creamed spinach and leeks. Two years on and more than 15,000 meals later that idea has evolved into a thriving business, Home by Simon Rogan, but the successful business pivot hasn't been a cause for celebration. ""Ask any restaurateur, the pandemic was a nightmare,"" he says. ""I know how lucky we were."" Still, terrible as it was, Covid-19 may even have helped Rogan to win his third Michelin star. ""The pandemic really taught me something. I had spent ten years gallivanting about the world and suddenly there was nowhere to be but the kitchen. I think our consistency has been amazing, that's got to have helped."" Is there a dish in particular he thinks might have swung it? ""At a push, our dessert called 'Anvil' [L'Enclume is French for anvil and the restaurant is housed in a former blacksmith's], which is a caramel and miso mousse with an apple and pine infusion. That always gets a good reaction."" When I spoke to Rogan in 2020 my plan was to drive four hours from Bristol to eat at L'Enclume but I was beaten back by the pandemic. Now that it has won a coveted third Michelin star I may never get the opportunity. After all, the French chef JoÃ«l Robuchon once estimated that having three stars boosted business by 100 per cent. ""We are pretty solidly booked so 100 per cent more bookings will be madness,"" Rogan says. In addition to gastronomes, the restaurant is still a magnet for fans of Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon's sitcom The Trip. The pair traded Stephen Hawking, James Bond and Ray Winstone impressions while eating there in 2010. When I bring it up, I can't see Rogan doing an eye-roll over the phone, but I sense limited enthusiasm for Coogan saying one of his dishes was ""a bit like snot"", especially on the day the chef has been given the most prestigious award in the restaurant business. ""We still get people doing The Trip restaurant tour wanting the famous window table,"" Rogan admits, a tad wearily. ""It was a long time since that programme went out. People tend to enjoy the food rather than sit there and do impressions of Michael Caine or Mick Jagger."" I was in the kitchen when they jumped me with the news"

503,1,Ericsson's Q1 sales grew by 3% YoY -- builds buffer of vital components,1111 words,Optical Networks Daily,"Ericsson cited a provision for impairment of assets and other extraordinary costs due to its indefinite suspension of affected business in Russia, ongoing discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding bribes in Iraq, and its efforts to build a buffer of critical components to handle supply chain problems. Comments from BÃ¶rje Ekholm, President and CEO of Ericsson: We continue to execute on our strategy to be a leading mobile infrastructure provider and to establish a focused enterprise business. We see strong business momentum and our investments in technology and a resilient supply chain have allowed us to continue to win market share and deliver on customer commitments in spite of global supply chain challenges. In the quarter, we saw organic sales[1] growth of 3%. Gross margin at 42.3% (42.8%) indicates underlying stability while absorbing cost increases in the supply chain. Our EBITA margin was 11.0%, adjusted for revaluation of holdings and provision related to Russia. Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine and the resulting humanitarian disaster is a major setback for the world. While mobile infrastructure is essential for communications in Russia, it has been clear from the start of the invasion that business in Russia would have to be reconsidered. Following current sanctions, we have announced an indefinite suspension of our affected business in Russia and recorded a provision for impairment of assets and other extraordinary costs of SEK -0.9 b. in Q1. We will continue to monitor and respond to the situation day by day, with priority on the safety and well-being of our people. In our core mobile infrastructure business, we foresee a longer investment cycle compared with previous mobile generations as 5Gâs broad application usage will drive a continued need to increase capacity. Technology leadership is driving our competitiveness, and in the quarter, we invested SEK -10.7 (-9.6) b. in R&D. Networks sales grew organically by 4% in Q1 reflecting our continually strengthened market position. Gross margin was 44.7% (46.1%). Software sales vary between quarters, and a certain SEK 1 b. annual software contract that is normally recorded in Q1, is this year delayed into Q2. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by proactive investments in supply chain resilience. Hard work throughout the organization enabled us to deliver on customer commitments despite global supply chain challenges. We also continue to increase our R&D investments to extend our leadership. R&D increased by SEK -1 b. YoY and was primarily related to our Cloud RAN portfolio, which gives customers more flexible deployment options, and to next generation ASICs that provide industry-leading radio performance, energy savings and footprint reduction. We foresee long-term attractive return on our investments similar to the last few years. Digital Services organic sales were down by -2% YoY in the quarter and EBIT was SEK -1.4 b. We are building a strong platform for Digital Services and sales development in the cloud native 5G core portfolio is encouraging with double digit growth, albeit from a low base. However, the overall result in the quarter is not satisfactory. The target of a limited loss for 2022 is challenging especially in light of the increased investments in R&D in service orchestration and 5G portfolio. We now increase focus on accelerating sales growth and addressing efficiency to improve profitability. To capture opportunities in the rapidly growing enterprise space, we are focusing on two specific areas. The first focus area is wireless networks for enterprise where we already offer easy-to-use pre-packaged solutions, with Cradlepoint showing strong growth in the first quarter as 5G coverage increases on the US C-band. We also see growing momentum for our 5G portfolio in Dedicated Networks. In addition, we are increasing investments in our enterprise go-to-market organization. The other focus area is a Global Network Platform, which will be built on global unified interfaces, so called APIs. Developers and enterprises will be able to create new use cases and experiences, like high quality video or XR on top of the 5G network, which enable operators and the industry to monetize the network investment in new ways. Ericsson intends to play a major role in building the API platform. With our previously announced intention to acquire Vonage ï¿½?more than 1 million developers, 120,000 enterprise customers and a proven scaled API infrastructure ï¿½?we will have a strong position to deliver on this ambition.  Ericssonâs IPR licensing revenues in Q1 were affected by several expiring patent license agreements pending renewal and by 5G license negotiations. We are confident in our strong 5G position and leading patent portfolio, positioning us well to conclude pending and future license renewals. Revenues from current IPR licensing contracts are estimated to SEK 1.0ï¿½?.5 b. in Q2. The actual revenue impact will depend on timing as well as terms and conditions of new agreements. We are currently engaging with the Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the breach notices it issued relating to the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The resolution of these matters could result in a range of actions by DOJ, and may likely include additional monetary payments, the magnitude of which cannot at this time be reliably estimated. As this process is ongoing, we remain limited in what we can say about the historical events covered in the Iraq investigation and our ongoing engagement on the matter. We are fully committed to co-operating with the DOJ and our work to further strengthen our Ethics and Compliance program, controls and our culture remains a top priority. It was actually our improved compliance program that allowed us to identify the misconduct in Iraq that started at least back in 2011. In light of the global supply chain challenges, we decided to create a buffer of vital components in order to secure that we meet customer delivery commitments.

386,0,Can China's Starbucks win back investors?,2688 words,Financial Times,"I n less than five years of existence, Luckin Coffee has been variously a symbol of the dynamism of Chinese capitalism, the subject of a massive fraud scandal and now its new senior executives insist a plucky comeback story that has the potential to test US-China relations. Founded in 2017, the chain of coffee shops spread quickly across China, creating a homegrown challenger to Starbucks. Just two years later, Luckin floated on Nasdaq with a market value that reached $13bn as investors were seduced by the prospect of booming Chinese consumer demand. But the company unravelled in 2020 after it was revealed to have defrauded investors by faking more than $300mn of sales. Luckin was delisted by Nasdaq and forced to pay $180mn to settle charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The scandal stung investors such as BlackRock and GIC and provided the latest illustration of the failure of Big Four auditors to spot holes in company accounts Luckin had been audited by EY. Most of all, it became a trigger for a political controversy over the presence of Chinese companies on US capital markets. The scandal was seized upon by some US senators as a prime example of how Chinese corporates could not be trusted, part of a broader push by some in Washington to decouple the US financial system from China. But two years later, Luckin is hoping that investors, regulators and even politicians have forgotten the entire episode. The Chinese coffee chain is staging an audacious comeback that involves trying to raise new capital, meeting with investors and plotting with advisers to relist its shares in the US, according to people familiar with the matter. The company declined to comment on its proposed relisting plans, but one senior executive said it was now ""in a position where we're more comfortable re-engaging with public investors"" and that it wanted to ""regain credibility"". Luckin says it has turned a new page. ""Almost everything about Luckin apart from the name has changed over the past two years,"" says Guo Jinyi, who took over as chief executive officer in July 2020, two months after it was delisted. ""The business approach, the operation, the team, the company culture which was responsible for the financial problems have all changed."" Since the company was delisted, Luckin claims to have been on a tear in China. Revenues have more than doubled to $364.7mn year on year in the latest quarterly earnings report. Luckin now has more than 6,000 stores across China, about 500 more than Starbucks. The rapid growth story that global investors initially bought into when the company started trading in the US in 2019 appears to have been borne out. Chinese consumers have flocked to Luckin in search of cheap hits of caffeine. ""Luckin is truly a national enterprise. It goes abroad to rip off others' money and then gives coffee vouchers to people in China,"" says Wang Ning, a 29-year-old wealth manager in Beijing and regular Luckin customer. That growth is once again attracting the interest of investors. More than $20mn of its shares change hands in over-the-counter transactions every day and the company's market value has climbed back up to more than $3bn, after its shares lost 90 per cent of their value in 2020. The question is ""whether the fraud was hiding a permanently flawed business or if it was lying on top of something legitimate that had long-term viability"", says John Zolidis, president of the New York-based equity research firm Quo Vadis Capital. Zolidis says Luckin's shares are ""attractively valued given the overhang of fraud"". Luckin's attempt to relist is a big test of the efforts by some politicians in Washington to limit the presence of Chinese companies on US markets. Will the political, regulatory and legal obstacles that Chinese companies face frustrate Luckin's plans, or will they be overcome by the lure to investors of one of the world's most appealing consumer growth stories? ""Everyone expected it to sink but it instead appears to be a phoenix rising from the flames,"" says a veteran analyst of Chinese companies in Hong Kong. ""If it were to relist it would cause all sorts of political ramifications. To a degree, it would look like a political act as much as [having] accounting or investor-related repercussions."" Luckin Coffee was founded in the south-east coastal city of Xiamen by a serial entrepreneur, Charles Lu. The former chair of the coffee chain, whose name means ""lucky"" in Mandarin, expanded the company's network of stores in China at a breakneck speed. Lu brought on Qian Zhiya, a colleague from a car rental company that had experienced similarly explosive growth in its early years, to serve as Luckin's CEO. On the eve of Luckin's stock market debut in 2019, Forbes estimated that Lu's net worth was $2.3bn. 'Fundamentally broken' At the root of the Luckin fraud was its aggressive expansion strategies, favoured by Lu, of grabbing market share for new customers with heavily discounted beverages and then inflating the net selling price to hide the fact it was selling at a loss. ""The company was burning through money,"" says one Luckin insider of the period leading up to the IPO and follow-on offering. This was highlighted in a damning 89- page report first published by American short selling firm Muddy Waters in January 2020, which accused it of inflating sales, poor corporate governance and being a ""fundamentally broken"" business. An undercover research firm dispatched more than 1,000 researchers to Luckin Coffee stores to monitor customer traffic and coffee sales and found discrepancies with their reported figures. Lu and Qian, who have both since left the company, did not respond to requests for comment. Lu conceded on his public WeChat account in May 2020 that his ""style may have been too aggressive"" but added ""it was never my intention to deceive investors."" Two years on, Luckin says things have changed. A senior executive says its internal controls have been improved by hiring personnel from the Big Four accounting firms to conduct internal checks and report directly to the audit committee, which corporate governance experts say is a crucial step for any company that is planning to attract new international investors. At the centre of the coffee chain's turnround has been David Li, whose $2bn private equity fund, Centurium Capital, was one of Luckin's earliest and biggest financial backers. Centurium sold $232mn worth of shares just before the scandal but has since bought several larger stakes in Luckin at a much lower price. Last month, it became the company's controlling shareholder after it acquired shares that were previously held by Luckin's co-founders. Li has been ""cleaning up the company, getting rid of the bad guys"", says a person close to him. He ""had a team camped out at the company for months, working out a turnround strategy"". Luckin used the cash injection from Centurium to pay for shareholder litigation and repay some of the debts due on bonds and overseas restructuring costs. The company is now on the brink of ending bankruptcy proceedings in the US, a crucial step in its path to relist. As a result of the bankruptcy process, the hedge funds that bought about $420mn of its convertible bonds in January 2020 will receive about 96 cents on the dollar. ""After only one-and-a-half years, they have got almost all their money back, plus some new bonds, cash and stock,"" says an external adviser involved in the restructuring process. ""If you break it down, it is a genuinely unprecedented situation,"" says the person. ""I've never seen another case where you have such a high return for creditors, settlement of legal and regulatory matters and improving operating performance all in the same short period of 18 months."" Li and Guo's turnround strategy includes closing down underperforming stores and increasing the price of a cup of coffee by 60 per cent to an average of $2.50 still half the price of an equivalent Starbucks coffee. Luckin claims it has reduced property and staffing costs through the use of an ""in-app"" purchase system and has started using franchisees to expand the number of its stores rather than owning them all outright. It has also had success with new beverages, including a coconut velvet latte that sold out over the summer. Xu Xueqiong, 36, owner of a small business in Anqing, a city in Anhui province, is an avid fan of the drink. She says Luckin's branding, use of coupons and sweeter flavours ""suit Chinese people's consumption habits"". Michael Norris, a senior research analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina, says that Guo's gamble to start using franchisee partners to share the risk of opening new stores, especially in lower-tier cities, has paid off. Revenue from those stores has tripled in the last quarter compared with the same period the previous year. But analysts have warned that Chinese consumer habits are fickle, and Luckin is increasingly fighting competition from domestic rivals with substantial financial backing, including a new, trendier competitor, Manner Coffee. Norris adds that investors may be sceptical at reports of accelerating growth: ""Revenues rising sharply is something that those of us who have been following Luckin have seen before."" It reported a net loss of $859mn for the 2020 financial year. In the first nine months of 2021, Luckin's net losses were $3.6mn, according to its financial statements. Carson Block, founder and head of Muddy Waters, says he is ""surprised"" at Luckin's turnround: ""In the old days, companies were finished once confirmed that they were frauds ... But Luckin seems to be saying the fraud is water under the bridge. That now they've raised the money on the back of lies, they're putting it to use and becoming real,"" adds Block. Winning back trust Far harder than inventing coconut lattes will be the job of convincing foreign investors and regulators that its finances can be trusted. Luckin is setting out plans to relist at a time when tensions between the US and China over the quality of Chinese companies listed in US markets is at an all-time low. The most recent case was the disastrous listing of Didi, a ride-hail- ing app, last June, when regulatory blocks by Beijing days after its flotation meant its shares crashed by 80 per cent and investors lost billions. Since then, new flotations by Chinese companies in the US have been in effect paralysed. Both Washington and Beijing are wary of continuing to permit the deepening of financial links between Wall Street and corporate China. To relist on the Nasdaq centralised exchange Luckin needs to first formally exit bankruptcy proceedings, which according to an individual involved in the process should happen in the next few weeks. Luckin will then apply to rejoin Nasdaq's centralised exchange. The exchange can deny a company's listing if it believes investors might be at risk, but in general, it is required to accept those companies that meet the exchange's requirements. The SEC and Nasdaq refused to comment on Luckin's relisting plans. The company will also need to navigate new laws that have come into place in the wake of its 2020 scandal which make the US a far less hospitable environment for Chinese companies going public. The US Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which was passed in late 2020, puts pressure on Chinese companies to make audit papers available for inspection. It could force about 240 Chinese companies worth a combined $2tn to delist from US exchanges over the next few years. ""There is no indication that either the US or China will budge on this issue,"" says Jay Ritter, an IPO expert at the University of Florida. Under this law, the US authorities could delist companies that fail to submit to US regulatory checks on their audits for three years in a row. This has resulted in a stalemate for companies and their accountants as Beijing does not permit foreign oversight of Chinese companies' financial records. As a result, even if it successfully relists, Luckin could be delisted again by US regulators in the future purely because of a lack of access to its audit files. ""If Luckin relists and is trading, what's the price discount for the fact that if you buy the shares you don't know if or where you're going to be able to sell them in two or three years' time?"" says one accounting expert. Crucial to Luckin's comeback will be investors' confidence that its books are credible, especially given the failures of original auditors EY to identify duplicity, and perhaps also the fact that the CFO at the time of the scandal, Reinout Schakel, is still in place. Since the fraud was exposed, Luckin has had two new audit firms. The group appointed Hong Kong accounting firm Centurion ZD CPA as its auditor in April 2021 after its predecessor, New York-based Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk, was replaced. As US regulators and exchanges put greater focus on the quality of Chinese company audits, the work of a smaller firm is likely to receive more scrutiny. Centurion, which says it has about 40 accountants in Hong Kong and the US, is registered with the US audit regulator, allowing it to sign off the accounts of Chinese companies listed in America. But so far it audits just a small number of such companies traded on Nasdaq or over the counter. Centurion did not respond to a request for comment. In its audit of Luckin's 2020 accounts, the most recent full-year audited financial statements, Centurion identified as a ""material weakness"" that Luckin lacked ""entity level control policies and procedures, including failure to demonstrate commitment to integrity and ethical values"". It also said Luckin lacked appropriate separation of duties, including around making investment decisions and use of funds. Even so, some investors may be tempted back into its equity because of Luckin's growth prospects. ""By market capitalisation per store, it is a cheap and attractive asset,"" says a fund manager who has traded Luckin's over-the-counter shares. Yet so far, it is primarily China-focused hedge funds and mainland capital that have flooded back into Luckin shares. ""It's hard to see someone like Fidelity getting back into it on day one,"" the fund manager adds. Winning back the support of large international investors would be critical for Luckin's comeback story. ""I suspect there is work to be done for redemption before that,"" says Kerrie Waring, chief executive of the International Corporate Governance Network, a lobby group for institutional investors. As investors question whether they can trust Luckin, one former US regulator says the fact that the company is under such intense scrutiny means it may be less likely to repeat past crimes. ""Sometimes thesafest place to eat is a place that's just reopened after the health department shut them down.""

""During those six months, all the staff members went back to their hometown. It posed a bigger problem when they had to come back but the trains were not working,"" he said. During the first lockdown, restaurants in Pune had to let go of 90 to 95% of their staff, according to Ganesh Shetty, president of the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association. Sharan Shetty, president, Poona Hoteliers Association, said, ""The pandemic has been the worst time ever for workers, with most opting to leave the industry permanently. This is invariably going to affect the industry as a whole when operations do come back to normal. To get the staff back has already become a challenge."" Although the Pune civic body has allowed eateries to remain open till 1.30 am, restaurants are still struggling to stay afloat with only 50% visitors being allowed. ""Running a restaurant at 50% capacity is not viable after paying the rent fee and the tax cut. ""Restaurants have to pay rents ranging from Rs3 lakh to Rs.30 lakh every month. Eighty per cent of the restaurant spaces in Pune are rented,"" said Ganesh Shetty. ""In many cases, the property owners have kept the furniture of the rent defaulters as mortgage, and cases are being fought in court. Due to rent issues and labour shortage, 30% of the restaurants have been closed,"" Ganesh Shetty said. According to Ganesh Shetty, there are 40 to 50 restaurants at High Street in Baner however 70% of them are still shut. The IT Park in Hinjewadi has around 150 to 200 restaurants. All these restaurants suffered because the IT employees were working from home. The situation is the same at Kharadi and Nagar Road. All restaurant owners have to pay an annual licence fee despite not renting the restaurant for six months, said Rajesh Shetty. ""Ideally, we have to pay for six months as the restaurants were vacant for the remaining time but the government did not consider it. I have paid around 6 lakh as licence fee. During the pandemic, I faced a loss of Rs.3 crore,"" he said. The Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers' Association and Poona Hoteliers Association had appealed to the central and state governments for help but to no avail. ""No compensation was given by the state or central government. No relief was given to us from the banks either,"" said the president of the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers' Association.

47,0,"As Omicron sweeps through again, Britain has finally learnt to live with Covid-19",584 words,City AM,"Already, the current surge has overtaken the previous peak. Yesterday, 3.4 million people in the UK were estimated to have Covid. The peak of this wave has not yet been reached. This should be in the first few days of April, at over 4.25 million according to the Zoe data. It's more than half the previous high point back in January. In a seemingly paradoxical way, this is good news. Several bits of good news, in fact, the first of which takes a bit of time to explain. Virologists established some time ago that the new variant of Omicron, the so-called BA.2 is even more infectious than the original version. Omicron itself is considerably more infectious than the previously dominant variants such as Delta. In the opening months of the pandemic in spring 2020, there was a newfound obsession with a previously unknown and mysterious measurement - the ""R"" of the virus, or the initial ""reproduction number"". Essentially, this is a measure of the ease with which any virus transmits itself in a social gathering. We don't hear much, if anything, about it these days. But the R number of the latest Omicron variant is so high that almost everyone in the country will end up catching it. The epidemiological models themselves, as opposed to rules they have been used to justify, do have powerful insights. One of these is a fairly simple formula which tells us the eventual proportion of a population which will end up having caught it - based on the R number. But there is a major qualification to this, one which has tripped up the epidemiologists time and again. The formula only holds good as long as behaviour remains unchanged. If people respond to a virus by reducing their levels of social interaction, the effective level of the reproduction number is also reduced. And as a consequence, if the behavioural change persists, the eventual proportion of the population who catch it will be lower. In the January and February waves of Covid, despite the relaxation of restrictions most people were exercising caution. Social mixing remained lower than what it was before the start of the pandemic in early 2020. But the massive surge during March shows very clearly that most people are now behaving very differently. Further the ease with which the latest Omicron variant is transmitted means that it will shortly run out of people to infect. Re-infection does seem possible, but only at very low rates. So there are signs this latest wave really will be the last major one of Omicron. In the meantime, rolling out the fourth wave of vaccines to the particularly vulnerable makes very good sense. Finally, it seems that Britain has learned to live with Covid-19. Â£ Paul Ormerod is an author and economist with Volterra LLP"

614,0,Omicron won't dent appetite for pubs,816 words,AFR Online,"Standout deals for the year included listed fund manager MA Financial paying $68 million for the Hotel Brunswick on the NSW north coast and the Great Northern Hotel in Byron Bay selling for $74 million to ASX-listed company bosses Scott Didier and Scott Emery. Dan Brady, who leads MA Financial's hotel funds business (including the now unlisted Redcape Hotel Group and its $1.2 billion portfolio[https://www.afr.com/property/commercial/investors-vote-to-delist-pub-owner-redcape-20210910-p58qgh]), said appetite for quality pubs would ""continue to be full in 2022"" and the fund manager would be among those looking to add to its extensive portfolio. ""Pub assets, specifically those operators that own land, buildings and business, are in high demand due to attractive growth in earnings and high barriers to entry,"" Mr Brady said. ""A post-COVID world is likely to reinforce the deep sense of connection that we all have to our local pub,"" he said. Data compiled by pub brokers HTL Property show metropolitan Sydney accounted for about a third of all deals in 2021, reaching almost $700 million, a 75 per cent increase on 2020. These figures included the $160 million of sales racked up by the Stanford family, which sold its three large-format venues in Sydney's outer west. Among these, the Vineyard hotel sold for a record $70 million. HTL Property managing director Andrew Jolliffe said a deep pool of capital seeking assets would keep the investment market buoyant in 2022. While much of 2021 was dominated by wealthy private families, established operators and sophisticated corporate investors beefing up their portfolios, towards the end of the year, new offshore capital sources made their presence known in the market, Mr Jolliffe said. ""A lot of them were underbidders in 2021. They won't be in 2022,"" he predicted. Highlighting the appetite at the start of 2022, well-known pub owner-operator Fraser Short, who bought the Lennox Hotel near Byron Bay with the pub-owning Laundy family last year, purchased two pubs in Windsor, north-west of Sydney, this month. Following on from his purchase of the Fitzroy Hotel in a syndicate with Todd Jacques, Mr Short added Tates Hotel for $10 million this week. Both deals were brokered by HTL Property. In a further sign of investment appetite, the sector also attracted new local entrants including Martin Scott, Australian boss of Swiss fund manager Partners Group, who swooped on the Lucky Hotel in the Newcastle CBD for about $20 million in December. It won't be a one-off purchase, as Mr Scott plans to ""build a broader portfolio of hospitality assets with lead operators running them"". ""It's an exciting sector that's always been of interest to me,"" he said. ""The last few years has shown the importance of spending time together with friends in great hospitality venues. ""Disruption has hit many markets globally, but this sector is one that will always remain relevant and do well if the offering is right. ""A good venue, with good service, food and atmosphere is all people want. And even better to be supporting growing locations such as Newcastle."" JLL pubs boss John Musca, whose team sold 83 pubs worth a combined $1 billion in 2021 including Byron Bay's Great Northern Hotel, forecast continued consolidation of the market by the larger operators in 2022 ""driven by both private and public-capital inflows"" ""The appetite for passive investment hotels as the retail asset class of choice will attract investment across all tenancy covenants, driving yield compression. ""The number of transactions is not expected to be as high as 2021, but the average transaction value is forecast to be higher with yields plateauing in line with global inflationary and interest rate expectations,"" Mr Musca said. Mr Musca expected the sector to remain resilient and to bounce back strongly from omicron, as it had done after previous infection waves. ""Notwithstanding the daily challenges of staff shortages and the fluctuating trade impositions ... on the whole the industry, and particularly larger venues, have fared well in rebounding from periods of closure. ""Industry stakeholders including financiers and valuers have successfully navigated a way to determine sustainable ongoing earnings modelling beyond the effects of COVID-19,"" Mr Musca said. ""The only outlier to this may be smaller hospitality or pub leasehold premises, where trade restrictions have potentially created to an impasse in landlord-lessee relations and business sustainability."""

473,1,FrancoNevada Corp Investor Day (Virtual) - Final,18327 words,VIQ FD Disclosure,"I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host, Paul Brink, President and CEO of Franco-Nevada. Mr. Brink, please go ahead. Please go ahead, Mr. Brink. Mr. Brink, you may begin.  PAUL BRINK, PRESIDENT, CEO & DIRECTOR, FRANCO-NEVADA CORPORATION: Thank you, operator. Good morning. Welcome to the launch of our 2022 ESG report and Asset Handbook. The session is planned to take 2 hours, and we'll break it into 2 halves. Some of our presentations contain forward-looking information, so please note our cautionary statement on Slide 2. We'll start with the highlights of our ESG report and Asset Handbook, and we'll follow that with 3 of our partners speaking about the success stories at Candelaria, Condestable and Eskay Creek that we're very proud to be part of. At that point, we'll open it up for 10 minutes for Q&A. Second half of the session will focus on our portfolio. We'll cover our major assets and then selected assets where there are either recent developments where we think the additional discussion will help you modeling. A number of our team will present, and we're proud to display the depth of the organization. There'll be time for 10 minutes for Q&A at the end. A few items I'd like to highlight about Franco-Nevada before we launch into the session. First, on our track record. As the IPO, our share price has outperformed the market, the gold price and the gold equity with a CAGR of greater than 18%. A year ago, we were announcing we had exceeded $1 billion in revenue for the first time. For 2021, that number has climbed to $1.3 billion and now our adjusted EBITDA exceeds $1 billion. We have a low-risk business model. Our top line interest are not exposed to capital calls and have little exposure to operating cost inflation, which is particularly appealing in today's environment. Our portfolio is well diversified with more than 400 acres in total. Our focus is adding gold assets, but we remain open to add any exposure to other metals and minerals when good opportunities present themselves. Our energy asset are performing particularly well on the strong price environment. We are, however, not looking to grow our energy holdings through acquisition at present to manage the ESG exposure. If the energy contribution is higher from strong prices, and that's all upside. What we'll cover today is the built-in growth and optionality in the portfolio. I hope we'll leave you with a good sense for the powerful combination of our stable long life streams and the optionality of our royalty portfolio. But today, we'll focus on our holdings, our people are equally important assets. We're blessed for the tremendous team, not just because of the individual capabilities, but how well they work together. The relationship between management, sourcing and structuring opportunities and the Board acting as an investment committee is critical. Both groups have tremendous experience and commitment and a common objective of making good investment decisions that increase the value of our shares. That's tangible, but arguably our greatest asset is a coherent and firmly held philosophy. It's a mindset of ownership to ensure alignment with our investors. It's a long-term investment outlook that recognizes success in resource markets, requires patience in choosing your entry points. And it's an approach to financial risk that puts a premium on the optionality of available capital over trying to financially leveraged returns. I believe this intangible is one of the biggest differentiators of Franco-Nevada. Turning now to the presentation, starting with ESG. The principles behind the ESG have long been a focus for Franco-Nevada. ESG is incorporated in our Board mandate and our executive compensation, and it extends throughout our organization. In particular, we believe responsible mining is essential to positioning the industry as a progressive player in the future economy. Lloyd Hong, our Chief Legal Officer, has a central role in our ESG effort. I'll hand it over to Lloyd.  LLOYD HYUNSOO HONG, CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER & CORPORATE SECRETARY, FRANCO-NEVADA CORPORATION: Thanks, Paul. It's my pleasure to be providing an overview of our commitment to ESG at Franco-Nevada. Our tagline is Franco-Nevada is the gold investment that works, and we are committed to ensuring it does work for our shareholders, our operating partners and our communities. ESG is a critical part of this commitment. I'm going to highlight some of our ESG commitments in the following slides, starting with responsible capital allocation on Slide 10. We recognize that our shareholders rely on us to responsibly allocate capital in the mining and energy industries. This can only be achieved with a focus on allocating capital to operators and operations with strong ESG track records and to projects that have been well-designed around these elements. We commend all of our operators' efforts to implement best ESG and operating practices, including over this past year, their focus on the safety of their employees through another year of COVID and also the focus on emissions reductions. A few of the efforts stand out our First Quantum, Teck, and Glencore's commitments to emission reductions targets and Continental Resources recent commitment to invest in a $4.5 billion carbon capture and sequestration project. Our greatest point of impact is our investment decision. Whenever we look at the new investment, we conduct comprehensive due diligence on all aspects of the project, including a focus on ESG. We review all material aspects of a project, including tailings management, water management, climate risks, community relations and others. We also structure our investments to address ESG issues. All of this is focused on ensuring that a project will be responsibly operated. Our Board is deeply involved in the review of new investments and keeps management accountable to review all ESG risks. On a number of occasions, we have refrained from allocating capital where we have identified ESG issues that don't meet our criteria. We are actively involved in industry leadership, including in the development of the World Gold Council's responsible gold mining principles, a comprehensive framework as to what constitutes responsible gold mining. As a royalty and streaming company, we work with gold miner to adopt the RGMPs and we also monitor our gold mining operators are performing against RGMPs. Since the introduction of the RGMPs in 2019, we've also been committed to voluntarily doing more. We've engaged an independent third party to review and provide external assurance on our efforts to implement our commitment. This is not required for royalty and streaming companies, but we believe it will provide further confidence to our stakeholders. Let's move to diversity and inclusion on Slide 11. We're proud of our diversity at Franco-Nevada and recognize that it is a key part of our success. We believe that it is important to achieve diversity at the highest levels and for diverse persons to have equal opportunities to realize their full potential. In terms of gender diversity, our first female director joined our Board 6 years ago in 2015. In 2019, we adopted a 30% target for women directors by 2022, and we achieved this goal in 2021 with Catharine Farrow, Jennifer Maki and Maureen Jensen, now serving on our Board. They bring leading technical, financial and regulatory expertise. At the executive level, both Sandip Rana, our Chief Financial Officer; and myself, are members of visible minorities, we have been with Franco since 2010 and 2012. Recognizing that we want to do more to progress diversity, our Board adopted a new goal in 2021, a 40% representation of diverse persons at the Board and the senior management level on an aggregated basis by 2025. Since 2021, we have promoted 3 members visible minorities to VP positions. We're proud of our team. We have also committed to seeking out diverse candidates when considering new hires. In early 2022, we recruited another member of a visible minority to be our new VP mining. Outside of our company, we are committed to several diversity initiatives, including BlackNorth and the Prosperity Project. Under our commitments, we have established a Diversity Leadership Council within Franco-Nevada, have hired diverse summer students and help to fund research projects. As well, we established the Franco-Nevada diversity scholarship last year, and the first recipient was Feroz Shah, pictured with Paul on this slide, who is attending the Lassonde Mineral Engineering Program at the University of Toronto. We're now in the process of expanding the scholarship to additional universities and additional recipients with up to 4 new scholarships this year. We are excited to help encourage diverse persons to enter the mining industry. I now turn to Good Governance at Slide 12. Board is committed to the highest governance practices. We are one of the first royalty and streaming companies on ESG goals into the executive compensation program, starting in 2020. As well, we ensure that we are aligned with shareholder interest (inaudible) think like owners. Between the Board and management, we own more than $200 million in stock. We are pleased that we've been recognized for our efforts, including the top ESG rankings by Sustainalytics, MSCI and ISS, as well as the Globe and Mail Board Games. I'd now like to turn to transparency and disclosure at Slide 13. We've been an industry leader for transparent disclosure, starting with our Asset Handbook in 2012 and our ESG report starting in 2019. Our fourth annual ESG report is now available on our website. Every year, we look to improve our disclosure where we can. Starting last year, we provided first time SASB and TCFD disclosure. This year, we've conducted a TCFD gap analysis, and we've also provided asset level emissions data for all of our producing mining assets using McKinsey's MineSpans data platform. I would like to recognize and thank our team as it takes an enormous effort to put together the ESG report. I would highly recommend everyone to download a copy as it is a great resource to help understand our ESG efforts, and how we are managing ESG issues and risks. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Nalinie Mahon, our VP, Finance and Operations at Franco-Nevada Barbados, who will talk about our community contributions. NALINIE MAHON, VP OF FINANCE & OPERATIONS OF BARBADOS, FRANCO-NEVADA CORPORATION: Thanks, Lloyd. Good morning, everyone. As Lloyd mentioned, one of our ESG focus areas is community contributions. I'm going to share with you some of the projects that we've been proud to be involved with. On this first slide is in Ensena Peru or Teach Peru, which we're involved with through our investment in the Antamina product. Ensena Peru is a network partner of the global Teach For All organization. Franco-Nevada provides funding for the effective and cash project, which is Ensena Peru's largest and longest-running program in Peru. The project aims to achieve a systematic and also a permanent improvement in the quality of education at rural Peru. It is an ambitious program run by a passionate group of individuals, and Franco-Nevada has been very proud to be involved for several years now. The next slide shows our involvement in some other community projects and commitments. We contributed to a project to improve living conditions in partnership with core mining and our investment in the Guadalupe mine in Mexico, the project provided running water and improved sanitization and hygiene to a community close to the mine site. We've also partnered with Lundin Mining and our investment in the Candelaria mine in Chile, our COVID mental health initiative for residents in the Atacama region of Chile. And the Antapaccay operation in Peru with partners with Glencore on a potable water project, benefiting a community close to the mine site. We also have ongoing commitment to community initiatives at Southern Peaks, Condestable mine in Peru. Some of the commitments that we made, where programs are being developed, our community waste collection program with SolGold and that's in the Cascabel area and with Noront, supporting First Nations communities in the Ring of Fire. We'll have more to report on those programs in next year's report. Thank you. I'll now turn it over to Sandip Rana, CFO of Franco-Nevada. SANDIP RANA, CFO, FRANCO-NEVADA CORPORATION: Thank you, Nalinie. Good morning, everyone. We're proud today to launch our 11th annual Asset Handbook. The handbook is a key document for anyone who wants to understand our business. It provides an overview of many aspects of Franco-Nevada, including performance over the last 14-plus years, how the portfolio has grown and become more diverse over this period, as well as the increase in reserves and resources on our royalty and stream interest. The asset handbook provides a detailed review of our portfolio of 404 assets. It is the most diversified portfolio within our industry, whether it's by commodity, by asset, by geography or by operator. But one key component of our business is our resource growth and the handbook highlights the continued increase in royalty ounces attributable to our royalty and stream interest, with the increase being 14.8% for M&I resources from 2020 to 2021. The 2022 Asset Handbook is available on our website, and I encourage you to go to the website and download a copy. The handbook provides the detailed assumptions used to generate our guidance. On this slide, we provide guidance for 2022 and our 5-year outlook along with our 2021 results. But I will reiterate the key items today and also highlight the areas where we have evolved our approach this year. First, I'd like to make it clear that the guidance we provide is on GEOs we have received and sold and not just on those produced by the operator as is the approach with some of our peers. It represents the gold and gold equivalent ounces that Franco-Nevada earns from its royalties and streams after recoveries, refining deductions and payabilities. It is a more accurate measure to forecast revenue and EBITDA than production GEOs. Also, please note that beginning in fourth quarter 2021 and going forward, we are providing all of our guidance in the form of gold equivalent ounces sold. We are providing precious metals GEOs guidance and then also total GEO guidance that includes our diversified revenues, principally iron ore and energy. We believe this provides a more comprehensive measure of our business and will be useful to investors to evaluate the full scale of our portfolio. For 2021, the company recorded approximately 728,000 GEOs sold, which was a 27% increase over 2020. For 2022, we have guided to a GEO sold range of 680,000 to 740,000. Within this range, we expect precious metal GEOs to be 510,000 to 550,000 compared to 558,000 actual for 2021. In terms of the major changes year-over-year, we do expect less ounces from a few assets, Antapaccay, Antamina, and Guadalupe, but these will be partially offset by higher ounces from Tasiast and Subika. As we look forward to 2026, the company already has built-in growth with expected GEO sold to be between 765,000 to 825,000 for the year. The key drivers of that growth are highlighted on the slide. Of this range, precious metal GEOs are expected to be 570,000 to 610,000. Key contributors to the growth are the expansion of Cobre Panama, which is going to 100 million tonnes per year from 85 currently. We will see a new number -- a number of new mines developed, some of which are currently under construction. Salares Norte with gold fields, Greenstone with Equinox and Orion and Seguela with Fortuna. Others we expect built by 2026 are Eskay Creek with Skeena and Valentine Lake with Marathon. In 2021, the company recorded $1.3 billion in revenue for the year. Looking out to 2026, the projected overall growth in revenue for the company is expected to be over 10% at the commodity prices we've used for our guidance. Please note, this does not assume any additional transactions being completed. With the low fixed cost nature of our business model, this will increase -- this increase will filter down and be reflected in EBITDA and earnings. One of the core principles of the Franco-Nevada Board and management is to have a progressive and sustainable dividend. We're proud of the fact that the dividend has been increased for 15 consecutive years, providing a yield of 10.6% to Canadian investors and 8.4% to U.S. investors from the IPO. Franco-Nevada has paid an increasing amount of dividends each year since IPO despite the volatility in the gold price. With the long life and steady cash flow expected from our core assets, we are confident we can continue to raise our dividend for years to come. For 2022, the company has increased the dividend by approximately 7% to $0.32 per share per quarter. This increase was effective Q1 2022 when in prior years, it would have been effective in second quarter. With respect to available capital, the company is debt-free and has approximately $1.6 billion in available capital to continue to add to the portfolio. I would now like to turn it over to David Milstead, Manager, Asset Management, who will speak to the updated royalty ounces. DAVID MILSTEAD: Thank you, Sandip. In the next few slides, we'll look at the underlying reserves and resources on properties in our portfolio, and Franco-Nevada's attributable share of those reserves and resources. Turning to Slide 22. The chart on this slide shows the change in underlying gold equivalent ounces in reserves and exclusive M&I resources in our portfolio since IPO in 2007. As well as the steady growth reflected in the chart, these same assets have produced over 57 million GEOs since acquisition. We do want to emphasize that the chart shows 100% of the operators' disclosed gold and silver reserves and resources and not Franco-Nevada's attributable share. But we show it because it's easily verifiable using almost exclusively public data, involves the fewest assumptions, estimates and adjustments and still gives a good indication of growth in the underlying portfolio. The main disadvantage is that it doesn't tell you what Franco-Nevada's attributable share is, and we'll address this later. Turning to Slide 23. The waterfall chart shows the growth in gold and silver reserve GEOs by region. Geographically, Canada has shown the biggest increase with Detour and Greenstone Hardrock being particularly notable. Cobre Panama, Candelaria and Salares Norte have made significant contributions in Central and South America and Tasiast internationally in Africa. It is worth noting that approximately 35% of this growth has come from the original IPO assets and 65% has come from acquisitions. Moving to the concept of royalty ounces on Slide 24. We introduced royalty ounces a few years ago. To estimate royalty ounces, we normalize the value of an NPI or stream ounce to that of a gold NSR ounce. Said another way, these are ounces where 100% of the cash flow is attributable to Franco-Nevada. To do this, involves making certain adjustments to a simple ounce count, such as estimating the percentage of land covered by our agreement. In some instances, our royalty doesn't cover all of the property. A great example of this is Nevada Gold Mines in Nevada. We also adjust for the relative economics of a stream or MPI. And finally, we reflect our other commodities as gold equivalent. The resulting royalty ounces reflect our best estimate of GEOs we can expect to receive in time. I'd like to conclude by showing the growth in our royalty ounces over the last 11 years on Slide 25. We estimate there's been a 3.3-fold increase in royalty ounces from reserves and a further 3.2-fold increase in resource royalty ounces, and that's after mine depletion. As of the end of 2021, by our estimation, we expect to receive approximately 11.9 million royalty ounces based on reserves and a further 6.6 million royalty ounces based on M&I resources. An additional way to look at this, and this isn't perfect, but it is directional, is that if you take the midpoint of our 2022 precious metals and diversified mining guidance, which is 575,000 GEOs. It would take 20 years to deplete the 2P royalty ounces and 32 years to deplete the 2P and M&I royalty ounces. It's been a great growth story since IPO, and we're looking forward to continued growth. So with that, I'd like to hand it back to Paul to introduce our guest presenters. Thank you.  PAUL BRINK: Thank you, David. We're delighted to have some of our partners join us today and to share with you their success stories. First up is of Adolfo Vera, President and CEO of Southern Peaks Mining to speak on Condestable Mine in Peru. Welcome Adolfo. ADOLFO F. VERA, CEO, PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR, SOUTHERN PEAKS MINING LP: Hi, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Yes, I'd like to present a brief story and what Condestable is going to look like in the years to come. I'm delighted to be here, Paul, congratulations on your Investors Day and presentation. And if I may, I'd like to change to Slide 28. So Southern Peaks is a portfolio of assets. We have Condestable, which is subject to stream which Franco-Nevada provide us with. We have 20,000 tonnes per annum copper equivalent production at the time of speaking now. We have a good track record of operational and ESG improvements over the -- we acquired Condestable around 8 years ago, and we've done a number of things with it. I want to talk about things we did in this presentation. But basically, I'd like to change to Slide 29. We have a clear path to grow from 20,000 to 40,000 tonnes per annum of copper equivalent production. And the way to do that is going to be basically in Slide 30, we're showing what our expansion is going to look like. We've grown from 7,000 tonnes per day production to 8,400 tonnes per day today. We have a feasibility study that takes us to 10,000 or 12,000 tonnes per day. We're still deciding which one is going to be, and we're in the process of getting permits for that. And in the process of expanding both reserves and resources in Condestable, we noticed that we have some potential for the old open pit areas, which at these prices obviously worked much better than they did before. And also the new interpretation -- the new geological interpretation of the mine has given us the confidence to go and start the work for putting those open pit opportunities into work. And also, we have a Ariana project as we intend to recommence construction sometime this year, most likely by the fourth quarter of this year. So the combined effects of the expansion of Condestable both on underground and the open pit opportunities, and the construction of Ariana will take us to be a producer of around 40,000 tonnes of copper equivalent per year with a substantial increase in the ounces of gold and silver that we produce from what we're producing right now. Slide 31, please. We also have -- we understand that more than the technical challenges that mining is facing these days, we have the ESG challenge, and we have decided to embrace and try to obtain the Copper Mark certification. We're well on the way of getting that certification. We've had our first documentary review of the process by Copper Mark and we've passed that last week. We're starting the audits week after next, and we are supposed to be getting the certificate by July. This is a major accomplishment for Condestable and for Southern Peaks Mining. This has been one of the most challenging targets in my professional career, but also one of the most rewarding. I'm looking at mining much different today than I did before, thanks to embracing the principles of Copper Mark. Slide 32. As I said, Condestable cash-generating producing asset, we've -- we're the second largest underground mine in Peru. We've been able to replenish and expand the reserve base significantly since we acquired that all our reserves and resources, our 43-101 compliant. We are -- for an underground mine, we're a very competitive cash cost producer. Post stream, we're going to be in an average of $1.80 per pound for -- once we accomplished the expansion in 2025, which is our target date. And we have also -- the underground mine is not near to being finished. We have good prospects of expansion, both at debt as well as alongside the geological structures. Slide 33, please. We are located very conveniently in Peru. Condestable is in the cost of Peru, it's 100 kilometers -- 89-kilometer actually south from Lima. It sits alongside the Pan-American highway, which is main gold infrastructure in Peru. So it's very difficult for -- it will be very difficult for Condestable to get into one of the blockage -- blockages that have been so suddenly famous in Peru lately. Ariana is in the main corridor of mines in the Central Andes in Peru, which has also a good connectivity, both through highways and railroads. In Slide 34, please. Sorry, 35 -- no, 34. I'm showing here the long and consistent history of reserve replacement in Condestable. We bought Condestable, it used to be a mine, which had between 3 and 4 years life, and it was the -- it was the case for the last 8 to 10 years. We decided to go into a drilling campaign in 2017. We essentially doubled the reserves at that time. And lately, we have been able to triple the reserve from where we bought from (inaudible). As I said, Condestable has very high potential of expanding further, expanding the reserve in the underground mine. And we intend to get as much as we can from drilling and geological interpretation that we now are doing. Slide 36. We have expanded, as I said, our planned capacity. We intend to go to between 10 and 12. We have really not made the decision yet. 10 is a number that is easily attainable. With today's infrastructure, 12 -- we can go to 12 by a simple procedure for permitting in Peru. So I guess my preferred number will be 12 about 3, 4 years from now, but we'll get there. When we get there, we're not going to risk the permitting process, which is something that is difficult in the country by trying to be ambitious. So more ambitious than we should in our expansions. Slide 37 gives us a section of what Condestable mine is like. We have -- as you will see in this slide, some intercepts at depth in the level minus 1,000. We have some drills that have got the same structures that we're mining at higher depths. And also the continuity of all structures continue to be the case for all the different structures that we have in both Condestable, Raul and Vinchos. Slide 38, we spoke about this open pit potential a few minutes ago. In the process of reinterpreting the geology once we have this new geological model, we discovered that this is a true opportunity for Condestable. There is a potential between 60 million and 65 million tonnes of additional reserves for open pit with a lower head grade, but obviously, a much lower cost of mining, which makes it very, very attractive for a new concentrator that probably would have a size of between 20,000 and 25,000 tonnes per day. So combined with the underground potential, we're very excited about what the future looks like for Condestable once we develop this open pit opportunities. Slide 39, please. The regional exploration of Condestable also something that we have not had the opportunity to develop. We have 45,000 hectares of land in Condestable. The Condestable mine itself occupies less than 3,000 hectares. So there is a lot of exploration potential there. It sits in a well-defined belt of mineralization where you have (inaudible) and a lot of other IOCG-type deposits. So it wouldn't be surprising if we can find something similar or bigger than Condestable within the land that we have to explore. So with that, I finish my presentation. I appreciate the opportunity to present Condestable and Southern Peaks mining. And I thank Franco-Nevada for this. Back to Paul, please. Thank you.  PAUL BRINK: Thank you, Adolfo. It's fitting that we follow your presentation with Candelaria when our team first visited Condestable, it was the similarity of the ore bodies to the Candelaria underground that have them so excited. Mark Turner, VP, Business Valuations and Investor Relations at Lundin is next up to tell the Candelaria story. Mark, please go ahead. MARK TURNER, VP OF BUSINESS VALUATIONS & IR, LUNDIN MINING CORPORATION: Great. Thank you, Paul, and I really appreciate the opportunity. And I'm excited to talk about our Candelaria copper mining complex in Chile. Actually, the photo on the background of this cover slide here, you can see the open pit operations and then our main Candelaria plant to the bottom left. So next slide, please, Jason. Just as it flips there, we can flip quickly through it. It will be our cautionary statements. We're going to make several forward-looking statements here. And then hopefully, you with questions as well too. So just for context in how Candelaria fits in our strategy to operate, upgrade and grow a portfolio base metal mines, providing leading returns for our shareholders throughout the cycle. Candelaria is really a core asset in our portfolio and key in our ability to continue to deliver on that strategy. So we acquired 80% ownership stake and the operatorship of the asset in 2014 for about $1.8 billion. Though we're operating several mines at the time, including a few you can see here, the Neves-Corvo mine in Portugal, Zinkgruvan in Sweden, and we are finishing construction of Eagle, it was really the acquisition of Candelaria that materially changed the growth profile of our company Lundin Mining. So we had effectively raised our market cap at the time to fund the purchase through a combination of high-yield notes, $1 billion of secured high notes, some equity and then the $655 million upfront from Franco-Nevada with the precious metal stream. So the sale of that stream really allowed us to maintain an optimal capital structure as we are going forward, both during the acquisition and then post. And that, in turn, afforded us the financial capacity and capability to reinvest in Candelaria for future growth and then also create significant value from that asset, as well as the rest of our portfolio. So in the next step, we were able to repay early some of our senior secured notes. With the divestment of one of our other assets, we had an excellent balance sheet and enabled us to acquire Chapada mine in Brazil in 2019. And now we're closing in the next few days here or within the month on another exciting acquisition, Josemaria in Argentina. So on the slide that's up now just a little bit about the complex. We call it a copper mining complex though clearly produces meaningful amounts of gold and silver. Our mines for the next few years is 83,000 to 98,000 ounces of gold per year. The map on the left, which we've borrowed kindly from our host here, illustrates why we call it the complex. We operate the open pit and 4 underground mines, as well as 2 processing plants. We'll be developing a second open pit La Espanola, and evaluating the potential to further expand our underground mines, which in a project we creatively call the Candelaria underground expansion project, or CUGEP. And so the Franco-Nevada gold and silver streams cover the current property position sort of outlined here with an additional area of interest on the map, should we acquire and produce from those additional land. So the stream covers about 68% of the payable gold and silver from the mine, 85% of Lundin Mining attributable 80%. It's set to reduce after we deliver -- to 40% after we deliver 720,000 ounces of gold and 12 million ounces of silver. And so based on our current mine plans, that's late 2026 without considering, CUGEP which could increase our production profile in the shorter term. Next slide, please. So a little bit more about Candelaria itself. Really a fantastic asset in our view. I believe, if not the one of the largest open pit mines, copper mines in Chile, not owned by a major, so by Codelco or some of the other major diversified. The open pit itself and continuous production since the mid-'90s and a few of the ground mines prior to that as well. And with CUGEP would actually be one of the larger underground operations as well too. The mine, the plant low elevation. So not high up in the end use of the first range, about 650 meters. Workforce is all local. I don't believe we have any expats on site at the moment. And even the majority of the workforce is from Copiapo, which is a mining center about 20 kilometers to the northwest. I think r"
346,0,Toast stock plunges again as tech firm's profitability declines,367 words,The Boston Globe,"But the improvement was due to a $118 million accounting adjustment related to warrants Toast has issued. Excluding the warrants, Toast would have posted a substantial loss. And the company's gross profit margin declined to 14 percent of revenue from 19 percent a year ago.  Toast's stock price, which had previously declined 30 percent from its initial public offering price in September, lost another 18 percent on Wednesday. The company said about 57,000 restaurant locations used its services at the end of the fourth quarter, 41 percent more than a year earlier. For the first quarter of 2022, Toast said it expected revenue of $469 million to $499 million, reflecting growth of 70 percent or more. For the entire year, revenue was projected to grow about 40 percent to between $2.35 billion and $2.4 billion.  Toast rival NCR this month said it would consider selling or spinning off some of its businesses, which could include its Aloha restaurant payments unit. An analyst asked Toast chief executive Chris Comparato whether the company would be interested in buying such a rival to boost its growth. âWill we assess strategic opportunities when we see them on the landscape, whether it's within a line of business or more broadly? Perhaps,ï¿½?Comparato responded. The company's growth from its own internal efforts has been strong as it âcontinues to execute extremely well, and we're going to continue to prioritize that,ï¿½?he added. The quarterly report was the second since Toast went public, and both have led to sharp stock drops. In November, the stock fell as much as 19 percent after Toast reported third-quarter results."

12,0,Where to live by the sea: the UKâs ten most expensive coastal towns revealed,747 words,Evening Standard Online,"According to Halifax[https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/halifax]âs annual seaside towns[https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/seaside-towns] review, which tracks house price movements in 191 locations across the UK, the average home in the beach[https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/beach] resort near Bournemouth now sells for a whopping Â£929,187. Located on a peninsula, Sandbanksï¿½?golden sandy beaches and proximity to Poole Harbour have earned it a reputation as a âmillionaireâs playgroundï¿½? home to ex-footballers and pop stars. This year the Dorset town re-took the title from last yearâs winner Salcombe in Devon where the average price reaches Â£912,18. Seaside towns across the south coast dominate the top 10, with other hotspots including Padstow in Cornwall, Lymington near the New Forest and Aldeburgh in Suffolk. Seaside homes are more popular than ever, with figures showing demand for homes by the sea has more than doubled since before the pandemic. While many workers did move back to capital after the lockdowns, many Londoners are still swapping city life for sea air, moving to affordable beach towns[https://www.standard.co.uk/homesandproperty/where-to-live/coastal-commuters-london-leavers-seaside-kent-essex-east-sussex-b993989.html] like Ramsgate and Folkestone in Kent. In Brighton, estate agent Lextons has seen prices rise by up to 25 per cent over the past three years. Auctions director Simon Caplin said a house valued at Â£400,000 in 2019 was revalued at Â£500,000 last week. He added: âTypically, we will launch a property on a Friday afternoon for a block viewing to take place a week later whereupon we will show some 30 buyers over. From these viewings we will receive anything up to 15 offers.ï¿½?Research by estate agent comparison site GetAgent has shown that seaside towns are outperforming the rest of the market and have seen the largest annual price increase of 13.2 per cent. This means they are performing better than new towns, market towns and historic towns. Founder and CEO of GetAgent.co.uk, Colby Short, said: âWhile the worst of the pandemic is hopefully behind us, its influence on the property market still remains, with seaside and market towns, in particular, remaining incredibly popular amongst homebuyers who have come to value the slower pace of life and benefits associated with more rural and coastal locations.ï¿½?The least expensive beach town in the UK was named as Campbelltown on the Kintyre peninsula in Scotland, where the average house price was just Â£91,201. However in other Scottish beach towns, prices are rising. Prices in Millport on the island of Great Cumbrae, last yearâs cheapest seaside town, have increased by 53 per cent. Meanwhile the island of Port Bannatyne saw the greatest price rise over the last five years, rising five per cent to Â£111,717 . The popular town of Margate in Kent has seen saw the greatest 10-year rise in average house prices[https://www.standard.co.uk/homesandproperty/property-news/margate-house-prices-double-home-counties-b981706.html], up nine per cent to Â£282,734. Russell Galley, managing director, Halifax, said: âOur ongoing love affair with living by the sea shows few signs of abating. Homes on the coast have long attracted a premium price, and this was no different in 2021, with the move towards working from home being an ongoing influence is where people choose to live. âThe average seaside home cost Â£287,087, up eight per cent on the previous year. âWhether itâs a lifestyle sought, the scenery or the sea air, when it comes to buying homes; we really do love to be beside the seaside. The biggest beneficiary of that desire last year was Millport on the Scottish island of Great Cumbrae, and over the last 5 years it was Port Bannatyne on the Isle of Bute. âThe seaside towns that attract the highest prices overall are dominated by locations across the south coast, with Sandbanks in Dorset taking the title of most expensive seaside town from last yearâs winner, Salcombe in Devon. Both towns have average house prices of over Â£900,000.ï¿½?The 10 most expensive UK beach towns  Town Average house price Sandbanks Â£929,187 Salcombe Â£912,187 Padstow Â£588,090 Lymington Â£565,790 Aldeburgh Â£515,444 Fowey Â£491,042 Dartmouth Â£485,760 Lyme Regis Â£473,861 East Wittering Â£472,364 Kingsbridge Â£464,858"

477,1,National Grid sparks fury as it cashes in on the cost of living crisis: Soaring electricity prices boost profits at the privatised public utility,359 words,Mail Online,"The announcement comes as inflation reached a 30-year-high of 7 per cent, with growing energy prices playing a big role in the increase. Power prices in the UK have surged in the past year, driven by an increase in the cost of natural gas. Oil and gas prices have jumped 37 per cent and 90 per cent respectively since the start of the year, leading to a Â£693 rise in the energy price cap in April. The cap is expected to rise again in October if global power prices remain elevated. There have been calls for the company to use its increased profits to reduce bills for households. Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said: 'Households up and down the country will look on in horror at the spectre of a private firm profiteering from the misery of increasing fuel prices. 'This is obscene, and we would urge the directors of National Grid to spend the Easter weekend talking to people who are struggling to make ends meet and look at how they may use their profits for good. The announcement just goes to show why so many people across the political spectrum are now calling for windfall taxes.'  National Grid makes its money by charging suppliers to use its network to provide electricity to households, a cost that is then passed on to consumers through a transmission charge added to their bills.  Wera Hobhouse MP, the Liberal Democrat spokesman for energy, said: 'People can't afford to heat and power their homes right now yet they are watching major suppliers rake in billions. The call for windfall taxes on energy suppliers is deafening yet the Government is burying their heads in the sand.'"

The consolidated profit, which includes the results of its affiliates such as POSCO Chemical and POSCO International, came as a surprise as it beat market expectations by a big margin. The market consensus was 20 trillion won in sales and 1.7 trillion won in operating profit. The company provided no details for the preliminary quarterly results. Final figures, including its net profit, will be announced later this month. Earlier this month, the steelmaker launched a holding company [https://www.kedglobal.com/corporate-restructuring/newsView/ked202203020020]and placed its steel business and non-steel units under its wing as subsidiaries to develop the group into an eco-friendly future materials producer.  POSCO Group Chairman and Chief Executive Choi Jeong-woo[https://www.kedglobal.com/data/ked/image/2022/04/15/ked202204150007.700x.0.jpg]  POSCO Group Chairman and Chief Executive Choi Jeong-woo said the company aims to increase its operating profit from the non-steel business to 50% of the entire groupâs profit from the current 20%, tripling its corporate value to some 130 trillion won by 2030 from 43 trillion won last year. DEMAND FROM CARMAKERS KEY TO Q2 RESULTS  POSCOâs stellar first-quarter performance came in the face of rising prices of raw materials such as iron ore and steel scrap. Iron ore prices increased to $140.78 a ton in the first quarter, up 27.1% from $110.74 in the fourth quarter of last year, boosting steelmakersï¿½?costs.  POSCO dealt with raw material price hikes by raising product prices for major customers.  POSCO aims to transform into an eco-friendly future materials producer[https://www.kedglobal.com/data/ked/image/2022/04/15/ked202204150005.700x.0.jpg]  Higher steel demand from shipbuilders and strong performances at its non-steel affiliates have also contributed to POSCOâs robust first-quarter earnings, it said. Industry watchers said one of the key factors that can sway POSCOâs earnings in the second quarter is the result of its talks with automakers over steel price increases. The steelmaker is currently in talks with Hyundai Motor Co. and other carmakers over its steel product supplies. Shares of POSCO Holdings were trading 0.7% lower at 284,000 won in early Friday trade in line with the broader Kospi marketâs 0.6% fall.

A fundamental pillar is the pillar of innovation and service improvement, and to focus on a series of businesses that we call the future winners, which are those businesses in which we have the best capabilities to compete and grow"".CMI is a multi-Latin family corporation with more than 100 years of history and is divided into two main areas: CMI Capital, which includes renewable energy generation projects, real estate projects and financial services. And CMI Alimentos, which includes wheat flour mills, pasta and cookie production; poultry, pork, processed foods and sausage manufacturing; animal and pet food; and the restaurant industry with its flagship brand Pollo Campero, among others.CMI Alimentos currently operates 350 Pollo Campero restaurants worldwide (including Campero in the United States), as well as 628 Pollo Granjero/Don Pollo restaurants and 280 mobile units.The senior executive revealed that part of the five-year plan not only includes growth in the number of restaurants; it is also accompanied by new investments, expansions and the possibility of negotiating possible acquisitions and mergers.""We also have a very aggressive plan to acquire companies in categories and countries where we already operate, and what we want is to strengthen those capabilities and strengthen the positions we already have as leaders,"" he said.CMI was founded in Guatemala in 1920; in 1971 Pollo Campero was born and a year later Pollo Campero El Salvador began operations, under the direction of a group of Guatemalan businessmen led by Juan Bautista GutiÃ©rrez, founder of the company.

989,0,How town centres found life after Debenhams,1638 words,sundaytimes.co.uk,"You would never have guessed that this emporium of leisure was, until recently, a huge Debenhams department store. The only remnants of the buildingâs old occupier are the escalators shuttling punters between the amusement arcade, bowling lanes and an e-sports arena. It is almost a year since the last surviving Debenhams shut its doors for good. Nine in ten former stores remain empty, according to the data provider LDC. A total of 276 branches have been shut by Debenhams, John Lewis, House of Fraser and Marks & Spencer over the past five years. Two-thirds lie vacant with no plans on what to do with them. Once the glue holding town centres together, department stores have become a sorry emblem of their demise. Gravity, however, is thriving. It is attracting 15 per cent more visitors than Debenhams did, and chief executive Harvey Jenkinson is in talks to take leases on another ten vacant department stores. His early success could prove instructive for the dozens of local authorities and property owners desperately in need of a new use for the empty megastores haunting town centres across the country. While the scale of the problem is vast, a number of big redevelopment projects are under way. Department stores are being converted into apartment blocks, offices and even a university campus. The variety of solutions emerging makes it clear there is no silver bullet, though ï¿½?and for the nationâs most deprived towns, it is difficult to see any solution at all. The existential challenge posed to department stores by online shopping was exacerbated by the injudicious development of out-of-town retail parks. Over the past two decades, selling space has increased by almost 50 per cent to 126.3 million sq ft, according to data provided by the retail and leisure research firm Trevor Wood Associates. Gloucester is typical. The cityâs shops had long been in the shadow of wealthier neighbour Cheltenham, before their struggles were compounded by the opening of the Gloucester Quays outlet centre in 2009. But a happier outcome is in sight. Just as the demise of Debenhams threatened to drive another nail in the coffin, last March, Gloucestershire University swept in to buy the huge, five-storey building for Â£3 million. Construction will begin shortly to transform the 50-year-old department store into a campus that will eventually host more than 4,000 students and 350 members of staff. âBy growing the student population in the city, we can provide substantial footfall and an economic boost,ï¿½?said Stephen Marston, the vice-chancellor at Gloucestershire University. âWe are rooted in our community, so it is part of our role to be part of how the community reinvents itself.ï¿½?For the neat solution in Gloucester to be replicated in other university locations, the building must be suitable. The old Debenhams in Gloucester benefits from an art deco facade and huge windows looking out onto the high street. But it is questionable whether students would be enthused about the prospect of lectures held in a windowless box at the back of a shabby shopping centre. Marston acknowledges that the projectâs Â£60 million cost is a stretch financially, too. The new campus will back onto The Forum, a regeneration project that will create 135,000 sq ft of new offices, 43 new flats and a hotel. For developers, it is easier to make the economics of repurposing a department store stack up if it is part of the wider regeneration of a town. In Altrincham, Cheshire, the property developer Bruntwood Works and Trafford council have formed an alliance to carve up the former House of Fraser store, known as Rackhams, into high-spec offices, shops and restaurants. Nearby buildings are also being converted into homes to bring more people into the town centre, theoretically boosting the retailers that remain. The collapse in demand for large shops is forcing landlords to let their department stores to discounters on vastly reduced rents. Chris Dawson, the boss of retail chain The Range, has opened in three vacant Debenhams stores and sees potential to move into about another 15. B&M has moved into five sites vacated by Marks & Spencer at rents that were low enough to justify mothballing the upper floors, which are, in effect, a liability because of the associated business rates. In towns where property prices are above the national average, it is now, in some instances, economically viable to convert department stores into flats. A block of 134 apartments will be built on the site of the former Debenhams in Southsea, situated a short stroll from the beach. Portsmouth city council has granted a local developer planning permission to construct flats on the two top floors of the building, add two new floors of flats on the roof, and build a new block of 36 on the old service yard at the back. In Guildford, an affluent commuter town in Surrey, developer Native Land bought the old Debenhams ï¿½?an enormous 1960s block on the banks of the River Wey ï¿½?for Â£20 million. The building will be demolished and replaced by more than 200 flats, smaller shops, restaurants and a riverside park. Finding a new life for department stores in leafy Surrey is one thing, but solutions remain elusive in the more deprived parts of the country central to the governmentâs levelling-up agenda. High business rates and less affluent local populations make finding new commercial uses difficult, while low residential property values make conversions financially unviable without significant government intervention. Mark Williams, executive director of RivingtonHark, which works with local authorities on regeneration projects, said: âJust because the space exists doesnât mean it makes sense [to exist]. Much of it is economically defunct and I can see a number of old Debenhams stores just remaining empty.ï¿½?Few places have been hit harder by the department store wipe-out than Walsall, which has waved goodbye to BHS, Marks & Spencer and Debenhams in the past five years. Despite being one of the most deprived towns in Britain, there are two shopping centres, a high street, a half-empty historic market and a Victorian shopping arcade ï¿½?all located within a five-minute walk around its unloved town centre. The scene in Old Square, the older of Walsallâs two shopping centres, is particularly desperate. Just three of the 30 shops inside are occupied, the toilets are permanently closed and the escalators outside the shuttered Debenhams store are blocked off. âThis was our main shopping hall once, but now look at it,ï¿½?lamented Cherry Smith, gesturing down the deserted walkway. As a former employee on a Debenhams beauty counter, the 53-year-old feels its absence more than most. âWe were all really shocked when Debenhams closed ï¿½?it has just killed everything else,ï¿½?she said. The ripple effects are reverberating through the shopping arcade over the road. âWe are suffering because there has been a dramatic drop-off in footfall,ï¿½?said Andrew Plested, owner of clock repair shop the Hand of Time. âWalsallâs market went into decline because shops were deemed more important, but now all the shops are closing.ï¿½?Maria Till, owner of Arcade Florist, started selling gifts to attract more customers after seeing footfall halve over the previous four years. âDebenhams going definitely had a big impact ï¿½?nobody wants to come down here any more,ï¿½?she said despairingly while cutting flowers for Easter table decorations. Recent history suggests finding a new use for Walsallâs Debenhams will be a huge challenge. The former BHS was vacant for three years before a local entrepreneur took on the lease, carved up the ground floor into 35 small units and sub-let them to local traders. Today, about half of them are unoccupied and the top floors are cordoned off entirely. The former Marks & Spencer store remains vacant.  Walsall council is using Â£32 million of central government funding to connect its bus and train stations and relocate a 1,000-seater performing arts venue to the town centre. The Saddlers Centre, a shopping centre that the council bought for Â£13.8 million in 2017, will be modernised and redesigned to open out onto the high street. Simon Neilson, executive director of economy, environment and communities at Walsall council, hopes these initiatives will pave the way for private sector investment ï¿½?but to deliver its 2040 masterplan, the council needs to find almost half a billion pounds. âWe like a challenge in Walsall,ï¿½?Neilson said. âPeople here are gritty ï¿½?there is an underdog spirit.ï¿½?Walsall, and dozens of other deprived towns, will need that in spades. Additional reporting by Laith Al-Khalaf Old site, new use The Gravity leisure complex in Wandsworth, southwest London is attracting 15 per cent more visitors than the Debenhams store it replaced. Gravityâs chief executive Harvey Jenkinson is in talks to open another ten in former department stores. Starting afresh The University of Gloucestershire plans to turn the former Debenhams store in the centre of Gloucester into a new campus serving more than 4,000 students, helping to invigorate the cityâs struggling shopping district. Grimmer prospects Andrew Plested, the owner of Hand of Time in Walsallâs central shopping arcade, is suffering in the wake of the closure of the townâs nearby Debenhams. Walsall has lost three department stores in recent years."
169,0,"McDonald's , Starbucks close Russia locations as isolation deepens; Retail; Pullbacks; Hundreds of restaurants shuttered",790 words,National Post,"Fast-food chain McDonald's said it would go on paying salaries to its 62,000 employees in Russia. The closure of McDonald's 847 restaurants also carry symbolic importance in Russia, where the first location to open, in central Moscow's Pushkin Square in 1990, became a symbol of flourishing American capitalism as the Soviet Union fell. Coffee chain Starbucks also said on Tuesday it is suspending all business activity in Russia, including shipment of its products and cafÃ©s run by a licensee. Earlier, Shell stopped buying oil from Russia and said it would cut links to the country entirely while the United States stepped up its campaign to punish Moscow by banning Russian oil and energy imports. The West's moves to isolate Russia economically for attacking its neighbour have turbocharged global commodity and energy markets, sending prices soaring and threatening to derail the nascent recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Shell 's decision to abandon Russia comes days after it faced a hail of criticism for buying Russian oil - a transaction that two weeks ago would have been routine - underlining how Moscow's pariah status is growing even in a market it used to dominate. ""We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil to be refined into products like petrol and diesel - despite being made with security of supplies at the forefront of our thinking - was not the right one, and we are sorry,"" chief executive Ben van Beurden said. Although no sanctions have yet forced such divestments, Shell and rivals BP and Exxon Mobil have all announced plans to sell holdings in Russia and exit the country, leaving France's TotalEnergies relatively isolated in hanging on to its investments there. Dozens of companies have shut down activity in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow has termed a ""special military operation"" aimed not at occupying territory but at destroying Ukraine's military capabilities. German sportswear maker Adidas, cosmetics firm EstÃ©e Lauder , and Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger owner PVH Corp . are among the latest brands to announce the suspension of activities there. It has also driven a surge in commodity prices, which mining group BHP warned could spill over into already skyrocketing inflation and potentially affect global growth.  Volkswagen said it would stop taking orders for numerous plug-in hybrid models from Wednesday, as supply chain troubles exacerbated the production delays caused by chip shortages. The carmaker had already halted production in Russia and has also suspended production at several factories in Germany as it has struggled to obtain components. Orders for the plug-in hybrid versions of Volkswagen 's Golf, Tiguan, Passat, Arteon and Touareg models would be halted until further notice and delivery of already placed orders might not happen this year, the company said. Dating company Bumble Inc . said on Tuesday it is discontinuing its business in Russia, joining companies that have suspended their operations in the country following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The company said it is removing all of its apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in Russia and Belarus. Rolex, the biggest luxury Swiss watch brand, joined peers Swatch Group and Richemont in halting exports to Russia. The only Rolex watches currently being sold in Russia are by independent and privately owned local retailers with inventory that was delivered before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a company spokeswoman said by email. With 8 billion Swiss francs (US$8.6 billion) in annual sales, according to Morgan Stanley , closely held Rolex dominates the Swiss luxury watch sector with a total market share of about 29 per cent. Rolex does not own any companies or properties in Russia, the spokeswoman said. Reuters with additional reporting by Bloomberg"
487,1,Retail Sales Rise Despite Skyrocketing GasÂ Prices,427 words,WWD,"However, gasoline prices ï¿½?pushed higher over the war in Ukraine since Russia is a key energy producer ï¿½?pushed sales at gas stations up 37 percent, taxing the consumer in a way that could eventually prompt bigger shopping changes. The official retail sales figures are not adjusted for inflation, which is at a 40-year high as the world works through pandemic-related supply chain backups and increasing tensions over the war, which is threatening Europe with a recession and has clamped down on the now heavily sanctioned Russian economy. Overall, total retail and food service sales increased 6.9 percent. Seasonally adjusted figures comparing March sales with Februaryâs show that all of the economic strain is starting to impact sections of the fashion retail world. While gas sales were up 8.9 percent from February, apparel and accessories specialty stores inched up just 2.6 percent and department stores were down 0.3 percent. Non-store retailers logged a 6.4 percent decline. Total retail and food service sales increased a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent from February. Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation, found signs of reassurance in the numbers. âWhile prices soared in March and eroded spending power, shoppers remained resilient and sales were healthy,ï¿½?Kleinhenz said. âConsumers have the willingness to spend and their ability to do so has been supported by rapid hiring, increased wages, larger-than-usual tax refunds and the use of credit. They are largely dealing with the shock of gas prices, but will be facing higher interest rates as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy in the coming months. The challenge for the Fed is to cool off demand without pushing the economy into a dramatic slowdown.ï¿½?

794,0,Rupert Murdochâs News Corp hit by cyber attack,388 words,Financial Times (FT.Com),"âWe appear to have been the target of persistent nation-state attack activity that affected a limited number of our employees,ï¿½?according to an email sent to News Corp staff and viewed by the Financial Times. The people behind the attack âare likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit Chinaâs interestsï¿½? News Corpâs chief technology officer, David Kline, said in the internal email. The company discovered the breach on January 20 and said the hackers accessed documents from News Corp headquarters, Dow Jones, News UK and the New York Post. It hired Mandiant, a cyber security company, to investigate. âWe will not tolerate attacks on our journalism, nor will we be deterred from our reporting,ï¿½?said Kline. Kline said he believed the attack was âcontainedï¿½?but warned that the company was âin the early stages of our investigationï¿½? The White House last year accused the Chinese government of teaming up with criminal gangs to commit widespread cyber attacks on US companies and government agencies. US president Joe Biden last year warned that cyber attacks could escalate into a âreal shooting warï¿½? This week, the FBI said the Chinese government had unleashed a âmassive, sophisticated hacking programme that is bigger than those of every other major nation combinedï¿½? In 2013, the Wall Street Journal and New York Times reported they had been hacked by China. China has a historically fraught relationship with western journalists. The situation had escalated in recent years as relations between Beijing and Washington chilled during the Trump administration. In February 2020, the Chinese government expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters after the publication ran an opinion piece headlined: âChina is the Real Sick Man of Asiaï¿½? The following month, China revoked press credentials of US journalists at the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, barring them from reporting anywhere in China, including Hong Kong and Macau. The US and China last year eased some of their restrictions on foreign journalists operating in the two countries."
148,0,McDonald's restaurants may reopen in Russia before May - source,192 words,World Service Wire,"On Tuesday, McDonald's announced that it would temporarily close all its restaurants in Russia and suspend all operations in the Russian market due to events around Ukraine. Starting March 14, the corporation plans to suspend services at McDonald's restaurants throughout Russia, while the company's office and the Ronald McDonald House Charitable Foundation will continue to operate as usual. All employees, according to McDonald's , will remain with the company and continue to receive a full salary, as well as keep all current benefits and guarantees from the employer. On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said that domestic catering chains could replace about 250 McDonaldâs restaurants closed in Moscow in about a year. According to him, 99% of food products in Moscow restaurants are from Russian suppliers."
598,0,Turn on the tap: $4b worth of pubs change hands in frothy market,805 words,The Age - Online,"Pubs' consistent food and liquor revenue, gaming machines, rental income, development profits from renovations and capital growth from underlying land values are making them an attractive investment proposition as COVID-related social distancing restrictions ease and the sector bounces back.  Real Capital Analytics estimates transaction volumes are on course to eclipse previous highs. Sales volumes for pubs dropped precipitously in 2020 after COVID-19 hit, slumping 22 per cent compared to the year before. ""Investors don't appear to have been completely put off by the numerous lockdowns Melbourne has undergone and the one in Sydney,"" RCA's Pacific head of analytics Benjamin Martin-Henry said. HTL Property managing director Andrew Jolliffe, who kicked off the latest transaction bonanza when he negotiated the sale of the Hotel Hollywood in Sydney's Surry Hills in April, says investor interest is at an all-time high. In late December, former Nine Entertainment boss David Gyngell and the widow of the late actor and writer John ""Strop"" Cornell, Delvene Cornell, sold the Hotel Brunswick near Byron Bay for $68 million to listed fund manager MA Financial. And in one of the last big sales of 2021, the Stanford family sold its Riverstone pub known as the Pub @Rivo, in Sydney's west to a private Sydney consortium, headed by PwC Australia legal partner Andrew Wheeler, for around $26.5 million. It was the last of the family's three pubs to find a new owner. Each pub in the portfolio provided extremely rare Western Sydney growth corridor real estate. ""The Stanford family's Sydney portfolio set new benchmarks both in terms of record pricing and yields,"" Jolliffe says. Bruce Solomon, a pub industry veteran, set the bar high with his purchase of the Carousal Inn, in Sydney's western suburb of Rooty Hill, from the Stanford family for an eye-watering $64 million. Solomon runs the Solotel Group with his family and celebrity chef Matt Moran and says pubs are attractive when they are part of a community where locals and visitors relax and enjoy being social after months of lockdowns. Solotel has owned the Darlo bar in Sydney's city fringe for decades and also runs the Opera Bar and Barangaroo House in the city, among other popular venues. ""The pub trade has been remarkably resilient,"" Solomon says. ""The big attraction of hotels is the consistency of revenue. As it used to be in the old days, people still have a drink when they're celebrating or have a drink when they commiserate."" Justin Hemmes's Merivale is setting its sights on building its Victorian portfolio where it splashed out a combined $80 million to purchase the coastal Lorne pub and Tomasetti House in Flinders Lane. The freehold interest in Melbourne's Boronia Hotel sold for $24 million ï¿½?48 hours before the official campaign closed. JLL director pub investment sales John Musca says the sale highlights the ""esteem investors hold in hotels as an asset class, delivering an internal rate of return exceeding any other form of retail property."" Musca says the weight of money looking for pub investments will continue to drive an ""extraordinary period of transactional activity."" Pub veteran Arthur Laundy last year swooped on the Bay View at Woy Woy, on the NSW Central Coast for $38 million. Laundy says community pubs are in ""high demand."" Long-time publican and hotel operator Fraser Short will take the reins of The Sir George from mother-daughter ownership duo Liz Prater and Kate Hufton this February after paying $14 million for the property. On the corporate side, listed property fund manager Charter Hall has become the country's biggest pub owner after investors in landlord ALE Property approved a $1.7 billion takeover. ALE Property was the country's biggest pub landlord with 78 high-profile pubs and bottle shops across the country that are majority-leased to the newly listed drinks and pub operator Endeavour Group. The ALE portfolio will add to the Hostplus and Charter Hall fund's existing portfolio of 62 Endeavour Group's leased assets. The ALE portfolio is attractive as the assets have long-term leases with lengthy options, a quality operator, and low site coverage, which provides redevelopment potential over time and are materially under-rented."

852,1,"Blockdaemon Adds Notable Investors Citi Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, Telstra Ventures, and Invicta Growth",866 words,Business Wire,"""Some of the most elite investors in the world have put their confidence in Blockdaemon, as we enable financial institutions around the world to engage in the cryptocurrency ecosystem through our stable and secure blockchain infrastructure. We are honored to now welcome Citi, Salesforce, Telstra, and Invicta to our world-class group of key backers, "" said Konstantin Richter, CEO and Founder, Blockdaemon. Over the past year, Blockdaemon has been on a fast-track, increasing its valuation by 10x since the Series A in Q2 2021; its revenues by 12x over FY'21; and its headcount by 6x as it continued to scale a diverse global team that maintains a strong majority technical talent ratio. The company also added multiple investors including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, and Tiger Global. Blockdaemon made two acquisitions during this period, crypto on-ramp company Gem and Anyblock Analytics, an infrastructure platform providing API, on-chain analytic tools, monitoring, and node hosting services across various blockchain networks. These acquisitions further strengthened Blockdaemon's robust 'node stack' of blockchain technology, granting financial institutions seamless access to dozens of blockchains with one single integration. Blockdaemon has also contributed to the open-source crypto ecosystem, including a donation to the Ethereum Foundation of $900,000 worth of IBM Cloud Credits to aid their efforts in testing Ethereum's merge. The company also became a founding member of the Flashbots Eth2 Working Group, an effort dedicated towards developing an open-source, rather than proprietary, MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) extraction Ethereum solution. Finally, Blockdaemon has strategically invested in Obol Labs, a trust minimized staking protocol for public blockchain networks based on Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). In addition, Blockdaemon launched more than 40,000 nodes; averaged more than $10 billion in monthly staked assets; and expanded its presence in global cloud regions and diversified data centers.

690,1,Amazon CEO Andy Jassy Pledges to Improve Worker Safety in Shareholder Letter -- WSJ,643 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"On employee safety, he said the company's injury rates were ""sometimes misunderstood"" but vowed to do better. ""We're not close to being done in how we improve the lives of our employees,"" Mr. Jassy said in the letter. He noted that the company identified ""the top 100 employee experience pain points"" and is working to try to solve them. ""We're also passionate about further improving safety in our fulfillment network, with a focus on reducing strains, sprains, falls, and repetitive stress injuries,"" he said. On the company's injury rates, he said incidents in its warehouses were slightly above Amazon's peers' average, and slightly lower than the company's peers' average in the courier and delivery business. He said those numbers put the company at about average compared with its peers, but that the company wants ""to be best in class."" ""When I first started in my new role, I spent significant time in our fulfillment centers and with our safety team, and hoped there might be a silver bullet that could change the numbers quickly,"" he added. ""I didn't find that."" Mr. Jassy took over Amazon from Mr. Bezos, the founder who is now executive chairman of the company. Mr. Bezos used to write annual shareholder letters since the company went public in 1997. The letters often highlighted the company's successes, usually told with a storytelling flourish. In a CNBC interview on Thursday, Mr. Jassy said he speaks to Mr. Bezos weekly. ""It's great to have a sounding board,"" he said. ""He has so much wisdom."" Mr. Jassy's comments about worker safety come as one of the company's warehouses in Staten Island, N.Y., recently voted to unionize. Amazon said in a legal filing last week it intends to appeal the loss because of actions taken by the National Labor Relations Board and the Amazon Labor Union. ""It's [the] employees' choice whether or not they want to join a union,"" Mr. Jassy said on CNBC. ""We happen to think they're better off not doing so."" He noted employees tend to perform better when they have direct connections with their managers. ""If [employees] see something they can do better for customers or for themselves, they can go meet in a room, decide how to change it and change it,"" he said on CNBC. ""That type of empowerment doesn't happen when you have unions. It's much more bureaucratic, it's much slower."" While Amazon hired more than 300,000 workers last year, Mr. Jassy said on CNBC that the company still didn't have enough people in certain locations. Mr. Jassy in his letter also addressed Amazon's carbon footprint and said the company is making significant progress on its climate pledge to be net-zero carbon by 2040. He said Amazon is committed to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of the company's initial target.  Amazon reported in February that fourth-quarter earnings nearly doubled and revenue rose. Mr. Jassy at the time said the company's costs were higher over the holidays because of inflation and labor supply shortages.

16,0,Ella Lei: No further employment arrangements for casino closure,285 words,Macau Daily Times,"She explained that the casino at Grand Emperor Hotel operates under a gaming concession held by SJM, and the croupiers, supervisors and staff are employees of SJM. A significant number of people will be affected by announcement of the casino ceasing operations. The lawmaker expects the grantee company to take the initiative to assist the staff by keeping them in employment through other casino arrangements and the staff should be informed of those arrangements as soon as possible. She also mentioned, at the end of last year, there were 1,774 fewer full-time employees in the gaming industry compared to the same period in 2020, among them, the number of croupiers decreased by 758. Moreover, legislator and chairman of the Gaming Employees Home, Leong Sun Iok, pointed out that according to the existing law on the employment of non-resident workers, the authorities may revoke permission to employ non-residents in specific economic sectors due to major reasons such as changes in the economic situation. Chinese media reported previously that seven satellite casinos are planning to stop operations by mid-year. Lei urges the government to take the initiative to understand the situation and prepare a plan to assist affected employees in the gaming industry. She also urges the casinos to fulfill their corporate social responsibility to continue the employment of their employees, so as to avoid making the unemployment situation worse.

823,0,Forrest fights Facebook over scam,362 words,The Australian - Online,"Mr Forrest is one of the few individuals who can afford to use the courts to attempt to bring companies such as Facebook to account. But he is not the only famous person caught in the online get-rich-quick scam web of lies. Mr Forrest deserves respect for taking on the difficult task of bringing what he considers a criminal enterprise before the courts in Australia and California.  Facebook claims that, like Mr Forrest, it is opposed to the advertisements, does not endorse them and has tried to weed them out. It remains to be seen how the courts will deal with Mr Forrestâs complaint alleging the social media giant breached anti-money laundering laws with its algorithms funnelling unsuspecting victims to cryptocurrency scams. Regardless of what the courts decide, the online trap is further evidence that Big Tech has been able to act in a way that is outside of the normal bounds of business. Traditional publishers quickly would be brought to account if they attempted to publish the sort of unregulated investment advice claiming fake celebrity endorsements as Facebook has done. It is further justification for online media giants to be treated as publishers, not carriers, with all the legal obligations that entails."

668,1,"TSMC says demand for capacity is strong ahead of 3nm chip launch, despite signs of weaker demand for electronics",878 words,scmp.com,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), the worldâs largest contract chip maker, said on Thursday that demand for its capacity will remain strong throughout the year despite signs of weakening demand for computers and smartphones. The company saw its first-quarter revenue grow by 36 per cent year on year to US$17.57 billion on the back of strong demand from smartphone and car manufacturers. Net profits rose 45.1 per cent to NT$202.73 billion (US$7 billion) from the same period a year earlier, according to its financial results released on Thursday.  TSMCâs chief financial officer Wendell Huang expects second-quarter revenue to be between US$17.6 billion and US$18.2 billion. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge [https://www.scmp.com/knowledge], our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.  TSMC CEO C.C. Wei, confirmed in a conference call with analysts on Thursday that its closely-watched next-generation N3 (3-nanometre) technology will enter production in the second half of this year to supply high-performance computing (HPC) applications and smartphones. TSMC expects its N3 chips to offer up to 15 per cent greater performance and up to 30 per cent less power consumption compared with its current N5 chips. ""We are on track for volume production of [N3] in the second half of 2022 with good yields, and we continue to see high levels of customer engagement at N3,ï¿½?Wei said during the companyâs conference call, adding that he expected more tape-outs on the 3nm node in the first year compared with its 5nm and 7nm nodes. N3, which will use the FinFET transistor structure, will be the most advanced foundry technology in terms of power, performance and area, according to Wei. Due to the complexity of initial profitability for leading-edge nodes, Wei said the N3 node would reach its average corporate gross margin in seven or eight quarters. ""We are confident that our N3 family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC,ï¿½?the executive said. The chip giant generated 50 per cent of its total first-quarter wafer revenue from advanced technologies, defined as those using 7nm or more advanced processes. These are the technologies used for chips in the worldâs most advanced electronics. Appleâs A15 Bionic chip, used in the iPhone 13, uses the 5nm process. Shipments of 5nm semiconductors accounted for 20 per cent of total wafer revenue for the quarter, while 7nm semiconductors accounted for 30 per cent.  TSMC is enjoying ""brisk demandï¿½?for its N5 semiconductors, with 50 to 60 per cent sales growth, according to James Chen, chief analyst at Isaiah Research. Strong demand from Apple, for its mobile and M1 Mac processors, and AMD and Nvidia for HPC chips are contributing to continued growth this year, he said. Asked about higher inventory among TSMC customers, Wei said that there have been some signs of softening demand in the personal computer, tablet and smartphone market segments. However, he added that semiconductor demand in other markets such as automotive and power management remain robust.  TSMCâs revenue from automotive-related applications grew 26 per cent over the previous quarter ended December, the highest growth rate among all six platforms, including smartphone, HPC, and the internet of things. Even if macroeconomic conditions worsen, though, Wei said TSMC does not plan to cut prices. Its capital expansion plan was based on long-term megatrends in several chip-related sectors, he said, so TSMC will not be heavily affected by a short-term downturn. ""The global semiconductor industry is expected to see gradual demand and supply easing towards [the second half of 2022] due to a potential deceleration in demand and channel inventory build-ups,ï¿½?said Kristine Lau, an analyst at global investment research firm Third Bridge. ""While TSMCâs mature node pricing is not immune to cyclical fluctuations, we think its price positioning may be less impacted.ï¿½?Still, Wei admitted that TSMC suppliers are grappling with Covid-19-related disruptions to deliveries of equipment and materials, which will put pressure on delivery times for chip-making tools for both advanced and mature nodes. Wei said these constraints will not impact the companyâs planned capital expenditure this year. Expenditures reached US$9.38 billion in the first quarter, up 6 per cent from US$8.84 billion in the same quarter last year. TSMC is targeting US$40 billion to US$44 billion in expenditures for the year. To deal with risks from Covid-19 and geopolitical tensions, TSMC has diversified its supply chain, according to Wei, ensuring procurement for materials such as neon, 40 per cent of which came from Ukraine before Russia invaded the country in February."
654,1,"Illinois company moves logistics division to Tampa, plans to hire up to 150 workers",570 words,Tampa Bay Business Journal,"The goals are ambitious but Ingraham believes that Tampa Bay ï¿½?and Florida more generally ï¿½?provides plenty of financial upsides. David Murphy, executive vice president at CBRE Group Inc. in Orlando, recently told the Tampa Bay Business Journal[https://www-bizjournals-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/tampabay/news/2022/04/06/i-4-warehouse-market-may-still-be-underbuilt.html] that the well-traveled Interstate 4 corridor is still underbuilt. Ingraham ""100% agrees"" and plans to grow with customers making investments along I-4. ""If you go back in transportation 10 years ago, Florida was a predominantly consumption-based state and a low production-based state,"" Ingraham said. ""So it was a high inbound freight, low outbound freight, and that's starting to change. Other companies are starting to realize very similar to us the benefits that Florida offers."" But it's primarily the area's talent pool that motivated AFC's relocation to Tampa. The University of South Florida, the University of Tampa and the University of Central Florida in Orlando are all great assets, Ingraham said. Tampa's hot housing market may also attract employees from northern states, Ingraham said. ""We did a lot of research,"" Ingraham said. ""Through that research, we realized that when talking to potential candidates, when talking to specific economic development centers in other cities, other counties, the offering that Tampa, Hillsborough County and Florida had specifically ï¿½?whether it's with the employee basis or with the positive aspects to recruiting [and] talent retention investments we can make with training ï¿½?it just knocked it out the park. Tampa was a sure thing."" AFC Logistics wants to tap into the ""transportation demographic,"" which Ingraham said are typically younger people who have a Type A personality. The company currently has five job openings posted online for Tampa. Ingraham and his staff operate out of the WeWork building but expect to procure a downtown Tampa office in the coming weeks. He declined to give a specific location. Workers can expect a completely revamped tech stack upon arriving. ""Weâre not looking for someone who says, 'This is how itâs always been done,'"" according to a written job opening for a carrier sales role. ""We need someone who can bring ideas to the table and drive better organizational execution through their production and desire to be more efficient."" Laura Fontanills, marketing and communications director for the Tampa Bay Economic Development Council, said the company didn't receive any incentives. The EDC is looking forward to welcoming AFC Logistics to the community. âLogistics operations have long been a target industry for the EDC and weâre excited to see AFC Logistics relocate its headquarters to Tampa,ï¿½?said James Nozar, chair of the Tampa Bay EDC, in a statement. âThis is another great example of a company making the move to Tampa seeking a better business climate with a growing economy and access to the highly skilled talent it needs to support future growth.""

899,0,"Fact-checkers from India, elsewhere urge YouTube CEO to act against disinformation",628 words,The Economic Times,"The letter cited conspiracy groups thriving and collaborating across borders, to YouTube being used in Brazil to amplify hate speech against vulnerable groups, and instances of millions of other users watching videos in Greek and Arabic that encouraged them to boycott vaccinations or treat their Covid-19 infections with bogus cures. ""The whole world witnessed the consequences of disinformation when a violent mob assaulted the US Capitol last year. From the eve of the U.S. presidential election to the day after, YouTube videos supporting the fraud narrative were watched more than 33 million times,"" the letter stated. The fact checkers are of the opinion that the policies put in place by YouTube to combat disinformation are âinsufficientï¿½?and ânot workingï¿½? They emphasized in their letter that the situation is even worse in non-English speaking countries and in the global south, where policies are even less exercised. ""It has been almost two years since the Covid-19 pandemic started. The world has seen time and time again how destructive disinformation and misinformation can be for social harmony, democracy, and public health; too many lives and livelihoods have been ruined, and far too many people have lost loved ones to disinformation,"" the fact checkers stated in their letter. ""As an international network of fact-checking organizations, we monitor how lies spread online and everyday, we see that YouTube is one of the major conduits of online disinformation and misinformation worldwide. This is a significant concern among our global fact-checking community,"" they added. Fact-checking organizations have sent four demands to YouTubeâs CEO that include exercising 'meaningful transparency' about how disinformation travels on the platform and publicly disclose its policies to address it and focusing on providing context instead of deleting videos. ""This can be done by setting meaningful and structured collaboration with fact-checking organizations and investing in their work,"" they wrote. Acting against repeat offenders who produce content that is constantly flagged as disinformation and preventing their videos from being recommended or promoted by the companyâs algorithms was the third demand, while extending those efforts to languages different from English, and providing country- and language-specific data, as well as effective transcription services was the fourth demand. Fact-checkers also rejected YouTubeâs attempts to frame the debate as a false choice between deleting or not deleting videos. The group said the evidence available today supports the effectiveness of presenting additional fact-checked information instead of making videos just disappear. That solution, said the signatories of the letter, âpreserves freedom of expression while mitigating the risks of harm to life, health, safety and democratic processesï¿½?In their communication to Wojcinki, signatories expressed their willingness to engage with YouTube to implement those demands and âto make YouTube a platform that truly does its best to prevent disinformation and misinformation from being weaponized against its users and society at large.ï¿½?The group expects to have a meeting with YouTubeâs CEO to discuss the issues raised in the letter.

457,1,"JPMorgan Chase builds reserves, takes hit from Russia",566 words,SNL Bank and Thrift Daily,"Net charge-offs remained low at $582 million in the quarter, up 5.8% sequentially and down 44.9% from the year prior. The bank's provision expense of $1.46 billion was substantially ahead of the consensus forecast for $755 million. CFO Jeremy Barnum said about one-third of the reserve build reflected ""name-specific markdowns associated with Russia,"" and two-thirds reflected a higher probability of an economic downturn under current expected credit loss accounting. The bank moved from ""low to slightly less low odds of a sort of [Federal Reserve]-induced style recession in our scenario analysis,"" he said, referring to worries that interest rate hikes by the central bank to combat inflation might trigger a downturn. ""Actual charge-off performance remains exceptionally low. So there's no doubt that right now, consumer credit health is very strong,"" he added. Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said the underlying economy remains ""very strong"" but that tighter monetary policy and shockwaves from the war in Ukraine are two ""very powerful"" countervailing forces. ""These things are going to collide at one point, probably sometime next year. And no one actually knows what's going to turn out,"" he said. ""So I'm not predicting a recession, but is it possible? Absolutely."" The bank said the net reserve build comprised about $127 million for the consumer business and $776 million in the wholesale business, including $426 million in the corporate and investment bank. Russia exposure also contributed to $524 million of pretax losses for ""credit adjustments,"" reflecting spread widening and derivative counterparty risk. Barnum said about $120 million was specifically tied to activity in the nickel market, where severe price volatility led to heavy margin calls on clients. The bank's trading revenue in the quarter, which does not include the credit adjustments, was down 3% from the year prior to $8.8 billion, better than the 10% decline the bank said it had been tracking before it stopped updating guidance because of the market turbulence. In an April 4 letter to shareholders, Dimon said the bank might ""lose about $1 billion over time"" because of Russia. After items recognized in the first quarter, the figure might now be about $600 million, Barnum said. ""And whether or not we actually lose that money is very much a function of some name-specific credit outcomes,"" Barnum said. ""There are states in the world where we wouldn't lose any. And some states of the world where we might lose a bit more, although I think we believe that's pretty unlikely."" Volatile markets and counterparty risk also helped contribute to a 7.0% increase in the bank's standardized risk-weighted assets in the first quarter to $1.753 trillion, and a drop in its standardized common equity Tier 1 ratio from 13.1% to 11.9%. The bank said it repurchased $1.7 billion of stock in the first quarter and that its board authorized a new repurchase program of $30 billion."

'In 2014, the provincial government leased the land to a private company, and the Samson group invested Rs4 billion and built a three star hotel, chairlift, zip line and provided other facilities.

However, the lawmaker lamented over the closure of the project and said that the issue would be resolved soon and security would be provided to the resort administration, for the smooth running of the activities. Talking to The News, Atif Khan said that the issue has been brought to the knowledge of the chief minister and soon would be resolved.

465,0,"Restaurants, retailers welcome move to lift restrictions in Delhi",851 words,Mint,"However, in a meeting held Thursday by the DDMA to review the covid-19 situation in Delhi it was decided to gradually ease restrictions while ensuring covid-appropriate behaviour. This was done after detailed discussions with experts, in view of the decline in positive cases, Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijalsaid on Twitter on Thursday evening. On Wednesday-Delhi reported 7,498 covid-19 cases on Wednesday. The positivity rate stood at 10.5%. Delhi continues to impose a night curfew. ""It was agreed to revoke weekend curfew and to open markets without the odd even rule. It was also decided to open all Government offices with 100% strength up to Grade 1 level. Restaurants, bars and cinema halls/theatres to operate up to 50% capacity,"" Baijal tweeted. The government has also permitted marriage related gatherings to be held with 50% capacity of the venue subject to a maximum of 200 guests. January has been a challenging month for retailers as the capital saw fresh restrictions. However, with fewer hospitalizations compared to the previous wave-retailers are hoping for a quick bounce back. ""This will definitely provide the much-needed oxygen support to restaurant industry in Delhi for survival. I would also like take this opportunity to urge Delhi Government to lift the night curfew and allow us full operating hours which would not only revive the beleaguered sector but also reduce overcrowding and prevent further job losses,"" said Kabir Suri, President, National Restaurant Association of India. Last three weeks were challenging for restaurants, said others. ""Consumer sentiment was not the best as people did not indulge much in ordering food. For our restaurants, the loss was almost 90% as the revenue generated through food delivery had made up for approximately 10-15% of the total sales,"" said Ajit Shah, Partner, White Panda Hospitality which owns restaurants like Tera Vita, Dadel & Kiko-BÄ. Shah said it will be challenging to assess the impact of the closures on the capital's restaurants industry until curbs are fully lifted. ""But once it opens for good, we will be treading our first step towards recovery,"" he said.  Traders' body Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT)welcomed the DDMA's decisions. Traders in Delhi have lost 70% of monthly business over the 25-day period, according to CAIT estimates. ""The withdrawal of odd-even system and weekend curfew will ease the business environment in Delhi to a great extent and the business can be revived now though it may take a longer period for the trade to come out from the slumber caused due to covid restrictions in Delhi,"" Praveen Khandelwal, CAIT's secretary general said. In a breather to cinema operators-film trade experts say this is could be a good beginning to restarting the machinery yet again after the brief spell of recovery for the exhibition business came to a halt last month. Several big films like RRR,Radhe Shyamand Akshay Kumar'sPrithvirajare expected to announce dates in the coming days while smaller titles likeBadhaai Dohave already set eyes on the middle of February. ""Delhi was the one big market that was shut so all plans were kept on hold. There should be a flood of movies now. The good thing is there is no weekend curfew which is crucial for business,"" film producer, trade and exhibition expert Girish Johar said. He added that the 50% capacity rule does not matter at a time when the idea is simply to bring people back to cinemas and in the initial weeks when there are fewer films to play, the cap can be offset by running movies on multiple screens at a given property. Maharashtra and Delhi together account for over 60% of Hindi box office in India. Removal of the odd-even protocols along with a drop in cases will help restore consumer confidence, said others. ""I think the demand was already there but with relaxed restrictions and cases down people will be more comfortable to step out. It will help retailers to complete their sales period properly,"" said AbhishekBansal, executive director, Pacific Group that operatesmalls in Delhi-NCR.

The project was unveiled in October with great fanfare and received widespread coverage. Tran, however, failed to deliver and tried to sweep it under the rug, said reports. Tran also spearheaded TikTok Resumes which sought to place TikTok users at entry-level jobs at multiple employers including Alo Yoga, Target and Chipotle.

Genting Hong Kongâs MV Werften shipyard filed for insolvency on Monday as it ran out of cash during the construction of the Global Dream, a cruise ship with the capacity for 5,000 people. A ï¿½?00 million (US$678 million) bailout plan that required Genting Hong Kong to put up 10 per cent of the capital fell through. The cross-default triggered would cause a material adverse effect on its business operations, prospects, and financial condition, Genting said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange, where its shares are traded. The board, headed by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay, is discussing with bankers and professional advisers ""to evaluate options available to the company,ï¿½?Genting added. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge[https://www.scmp.com/knowledge], our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Trading in Genting was suspended from Friday for the announcement when it fell 6.4 per cent to 73 Hong Kong cents. The stock has lost half its value since 2018, with US$766 million of capitalisation wiped out, as the global cruise and tourism industry became the biggest casualty of the Covid-19 pandemic. ""Cruise lines, related to the tourism businesses, were hard hit by the coronavirus outbreak and many of them cannot survive without financial support from the authorities or their shareholder,ï¿½?said Lu Ming, an agent at Shanghai Ocean Shipping Agency. ""It is not a surprise to see a builder of cruise ships become insolvent.ï¿½?Global Dream was originally expected to set sail in 2021 but construction stalled at 80 per cent completion due to the onset of the pandemic, MV Werften said. The insolvency filing in Germany will trigger cross-default events under certain financing arrangements of the Genting group, involving an aggregate principal amount of US$2.78 billion, the company said in its exchange filing. That leaves it at the mercy of creditors, who now have the right to demand or sue for immediate repayment. Besides the MV Werften shipyard, Genting Hong Kong operates three cruise lines ï¿½?Dream Cruises, Crystal Cruises and Star Cruises. It also owns and operates the Resorts World Manila casino and resort in the Philippines.  Genting Hong Kong reported a US$283.3 million loss in the first half of 2021, in addition to a US$1.72 billion setback in 2020 the global travel and tourism industry came to an abrupt halt because of Covid-19 restrictions. The bankruptcy filing in Germany stemmed from a legal proceeding under which German creditors including the Economic Stabilisation Fund required the shipyard to meet certain milestones before drawing down a US$88 million loan to ease its liquidity crunch. Authorities in Germany blamed Genting and senior executives for the shipyardâs collapse, according to a report by the Associated Press. Genting Hong Kong said that it had offered to increase its funding from US$30 million to US$42 million, but was still unable to access new funds to bail out the shipbuilding subsidiary."

Not both."" The post was subsequently deleted. Spotify has yet to reply publicly, and neither has Young's long-time label, Reprise, owned by Warner Music Group. The ornery singer and activist, whose 1988 song This Note's for You is an antagonistic commentary on corporate concert sponsorship, hasn't toured since the pandemic began almost two years ago. âI'm still not playing anywhere,"" Young told The Globe and Mail last December, upon the release of his album Barn. âI don't want to. I don't think we're ready. I don't want to be part of a superspreader event. I'm waiting until we get a grip on what we're doing."" Young is decidedly pro-vaccine, having suffered from polio as a child (as did Joni Mitchell). His fiery righteousness comes at a time when other rock-star elders are disappointing people at all turns. Last week, Bono trashed his own legacy when he said many U2 songs make him cringe today. âI've been in the car when one of our songs has come on the radio and I've been the colour of, as we say in Dublin, scarlet,"" Bono said in a Hollywood Reporter podcast. âI'm just so embarrassed."" It was a thoughtless remark. The music of U2, for better or worse, means a lot to millions of people. In a self-serving attempt to appear humble, Bono trashed the tastes and the loyalty of his fans. The man who once sang, âI want to run, I want to hide"" would do well to heed that impulse. Legendary guitarist Eric Clapton's long, sad descent into irrelevancy continued with more of his anti-vaccine discourse. In a Real Music Observer interview on YouTube, he said people were being persuaded to accept masking and vaccines through âmass hypnosis formation."" And then there's British musician Damon Albarn, front man of the bands Blur and Gorillaz, who disrespected Taylor Swift in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, saying she âdoesn't write her own songs"" and that co-writing âdoesn't count."" Albarn, it should be noted, is famous for writing a âwoo-hoo"" chorus. After the social-media savvy Swift fired back at him on Twitter, Albarn issued an apology. What's interesting about Swift's post to Albarn is that she professed to being âsuch a big fan"" of his. She was only 11 when Blur's Song 2 was released. The adage ânever meet your heroes,"" then, is proving to be sound advice. The comments from Clapton, Bono and Albarn ï¿½?don't even mention Van Morrison ï¿½?are a total drag. Young has some advice for that: âDon't let it bring you down, it's only castles burning,"" he sang in 1970. âFind someone who's turning, and you will come around."" This week, Young just happens to be that someone."

93,0,Burger King powerless as Russian outlets stay open,437 words,Evening Standard,"The company is the latest operator to run into trouble with local partners in Russia. Marks & Spencer has this week faced criticism as it struggles to shut down franchised stores in the country.  David Shear, international president at RBI, said in an open letter that Burger King's local partner and day-to-day operations chief, businessman Alexander Kolobov, had refused to recognise sanctions. ""We contacted the main operator of the business and demanded the suspension of Burger King restaurant operations in Russia,"" Shear wrote. ""He has refused to do so.""  RBI has already stopped supporting Burger King Russia's supply chain, operations and marketing and said it was fully complying with sanctions. There are no legal clauses that allow Burger King to ""simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement,"" Shear said. He wrote: ""Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today? No.""  Burger King entered Russia a decade ago as a rival to McDonald's, which opened its first branch in 1991. Burger King now has 800 franchise outlets in the country. It operates through a joint venture with three partners: Kolobov, private equity and asset management firm Investment Capital Ukraine, and Russian state-owned VTB Bank, which has already been targeted by sanctions.  Burger King is not alone in struggling to extract itself from Russia. This week Conservative MP Alicia Kearns called on Marks & Spencer to immediately close all its operations in Russia after reports emerged that branches were still open. A fortnight ago, the retailer stopped supplying its Turkish franchisee's businesses in Russia but stores remain open and continue to sell remaining stock. M&S has 48 franchised shops with 1200 employees in the country. Shear said there were ""other brands in Russia with similar structures"" facing the same problem as Burger King. Pictures have emerged on social media of a select few McDonald's remaining open a day after the fast food giant called for closure of all its outlets in Russia. The chain had to clarify that those restaurants were simply winding down their business ready for closure. McDonald's has now temporarily shuttered all restaurants in Russia. @Banham72"
74,0,"During COVID, they fled for the 'burbs. Now, they're scrambling for city rentals",846 words,The Toronto Star,"But as some employers in the Toronto core are calling staff back to the office - at least a couple of days a week - some employees regret the big move away, several realtors told the Star, andare now trying to find a second place in the city. ""They're people who bought in Whitby ... they bought a house, but then they realize their job wants them to be in the office half the week,"" said Nasma Ali, a Toronto broker and founder of One Group, a real estate agency. She said she's been approached by single people who bought homes outside the Toronto core and are now looking for rentals downtown as they've been called back to work. ""Instead of selling their house, they're thinking they're going to rent out their house, and rent downtown to be closer to the office,"" said Ali. ""It's not just the commute ... it's also gas,"" she said, as gas prices have risen due to the invasion of Ukraine, leading to much more costly commutes. Mila Sheina, a realtor and broker at The Spring Team, says some clients who bought elsewhere are looking for micro-condos to live in a few days a week while at the office. ""They're the size of an office pod, with a toilet. I actually have a guy who lives somewhere far away, who is looking to purchase a place downtown just so he can come there when he's driving down to Toronto (to) work,"" said Sheina. Nicole Li, a Toronto realtor at HomeLife Landmark Realty, said although her clients aren't looking for a second place downtown, many who are under 35 and went to live with their parents during the pandemic are now looking to move back to the city as soon as possible. ""Everyone just wants to move to downtown Toronto again, and that's why the prices have been going up,"" she said. In recent months, Toronto condo prices have surged, increasing 16.4 per cent year over year in the fourth quarter of 2021 and reaching an average of $710,087, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board. At the same time, the price of a one-bedroom rental in Toronto has increased by 13.7 per cent to $2,099, according to TRREB. Saeid Hashemi, a volunteer at More Neighbours, an affordable housing advocacy group, said a solution is to ensure that multiple types of housing are available to increase supply, so there is less concern over a person buying multiple properties and taking up stock. ""The reason we have this, is a shortage generally,"" he said. ""We're essentially playing musical chairs with our housing stock ... more for someone, means less for someone else,"" he said. If that supply was there, it's not necessarily a bad thing to have people live closer to where their jobs are, as reducing commutes is better for the environment, he added. However, Mark Richardson, a volunteer technical lead with advocacy group HousingNowTO, said the number of people looking for a second, smaller unit in the core is likely not significant enough to cause any major disruptions. He said younger people are returning to the city in droves, particularly university and college students in the next few months, which will have a bigger impact on the rental market. ""There are only so many people who sold up and moved out of town, and there are only so many of those people who are being told they have to come back to the office, 220 days a year downtown,"" he said, as many companies continue with flexible work-from-home arrangements. And despite the conundrum these employees now find themselves in, those who were able to work from home and buy into the market outside the city are still the ones to have benefited from the housing market during the pandemic, said Nemoy Lewis, an assistant professor at the school of urban and regional planning at Ryerson University. ""You have a situation like this where you have folks that were able to work from home, able to keep there jobs, were able to afford homes in the suburbs and then rent units in the downtown core."" Interest rates in 2020 were at record lows, which benefitted upper and middle class people seeking to get into the market, said Lewis, while many lower income people lost their jobs or were evicted during the same time. ""It goes to show you the failures of the system itself and policies to adequately allocate housing in this city,"" he said."

A new initiative aims to change that, connecting rural NSW with classical musicians through a series of concerts across the state. Formed late last year, Music in the Regions is supporting emerging and established musicians by giving them the chance to perform in locations as varied as Gunning Courthouse, the railway precinct in Temora and Southern Cross Cinema in Young. First cab off the rank is Acacia Quartet (pictured), an acclaimed string ensemble that has showcased its talents everywhere from Berlin and Vancouver to the Sydney Opera House. The foursomeâs first concert will be in Goulburn on March 2, featuring works by Mozart, Borodin and Australian composer Alice Chance. Performance isnât the only name of the game. The program is designed to build relationships between the musicians and their audiences, who can take part in workshops and meet the entertainers. To strengthen those ties, ensembles will return to the same locations every year for three years. Acaciaâs viola player, Stefan Duwe, says: âThereâs something particularly special about performing for smaller audiences in the regions. We just love it. [Itâs] a chance to meet people we might not otherwise meet.ï¿½?Details of a second concert series will be announced soon; Acacia Quartet, March 2-11. facebook.com/MusicInTheRegions PENNY HUNTER"

427,0,GOVERNMENT SPENDING Â£1.2 MILLION A DAY HOUSING ASYLUM SEEKERS IN HOTELS,581 words,Press Association National Newswire,"Home Secretary Priti Patel said there was a challenge in finding homes for thousands of refugees who were still in hotels, months after they were evacuated from Afghanistan. She told MPs: ""We are absolutely struggling with local authorities finding housing accommodation, also we want to make sure that we can move people into work and employment. We want them to rebuild their lives here. ""So there is actually ... a cross-government task force, we have a minister for resettlement that leads on this, but we are desperately still trying to pull together different component parts."" It comes as Conservative MP Tim Loughton told Ms Patel that one Afghan refugee in his constituency with young children was in a hotel with ""appalling food"" and ""terrible conditions"". He said he was called a troublemaker and told to shut up and leave when he complained. Ms Patel asked him to provide her with more details, adding that it was an ""awful situation"". Home Office official Tricia Hayes said homes had been found for 4,000 Afghan refugees so far and 12,000 remained in ""bridging accommodation"". The second permanent secretary was told that some local authorities had reported offering accommodation, only for the Home Office to take months to take them up on their offer. She said that was not what they thought was happening, but that sometimes the type of housing being offered might not be appropriate for a particular family. There were now improved communication systems, such as a dedicated portal to connect people who could offer accommodation with councils and the Government to help match them with families, she said. She added: ""We're incredibly grateful to the 300 councils that have already stepped forward to help us, but we can always do with more. ""So it's a good opportunity just to have a call to arms to councils around the country to engage in the new communication and engagement tools that we've created and make places available."" Ms Hayes also said there was work under way to improve how the Government worked with councils on housing asylum seekers more generally. She said: ""We have been doing a lot of work recently with the Local Government Association and with other councils to see how we can develop a new way of working with local authorities for asylum schemes, which recognises, as the Home Secretary said, the absolutely financial as well as policy imperative of cutting the cost that we're currently incurring in hotels, which is now racking up to about Â£1.2 million every single day. ""So we're optimistic that we're going to be able to broker a new way of working with local government on how we manage these costs."" Ms Patel added: ""This is a thoroughly inadequate policy, it is not something that we want, and this is part of the reason why there is a lot of wider work taking place on asylum accommodation. ""We do not want people in hotels, we are looking at dispersed accommodation."""

587,0,Packer on cusp of ending family's 23-year rocky affair with Crown,1296 words,The Age - Online,"Crown's new chairman Ziggy Switkowski, his chief executive Steven McCann and their bankers at UBS knew to expect the letter. Blackstone's advisers at Morgan Stanley called them on Wednesday afternoon, those close to the events say, triggering a board meeting that night. At 8.40am on Thursday morning, with the written offer in hand, Crown released a statement to the ASX notifying investors not only that Blackstone had increased its offer from $12.50 to $13.10 per share, but what Crown thought about it. Finally, the board said, the price was right. If Blackstone made the offer a binding bid, and nobody trumped it, then shareholders should accept the deal and pass the Crown's casinos in Melbourne and Perth, and its sparkling new Sydney tower on the harbour, Barangaroo, into private hands. In reality there is only one shareholder who matters - James Packer - and he was in Los Angeles where it was approaching 2pm. Despite his still-dominant 37 per cent shareholding, Packer has been effectively frozen out of the company he previously ran as executive chairman after a scathing NSW inquiry found his damaging influence was a key reason Crown was unfit to run the casino at its new $2.2 billion Sydney resort. That meant Packer, the loyal offsiders at his private company Consolidated Press Holdings (CPH), and their adviser Moelis, found out about the new offer at the same time as everyone else. Nevertheless, Packer's team was quick to indicate tentative support in a lunchtime statement which said it was ""encouraged by today's announcement"". A sale would end the Packer family's 23-year association with Crown, which kicked off with Kerry Packer announcing plans to acquire the original Melbourne casino in December 1998. James Packer's determination to make a cathartic exit from the casino operator ï¿½?which has dominated his professional and private life since Crown staff were arrested by Chinese authorities in 2016 ï¿½?is no surprise. Just three years ago the billionaire scion himself was trying to negotiate a takeover of Crown, first with Las Vegas giant Wynn, and then an ill-fated sale to Lawrence Ho of Hong Kong's Melco Resorts. That was before a series of reports by The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald and 60 Minutes into Crown's affairs in July 2019 triggered inquiries which led to Crown being deemed unsuitable to hold its casino licences in Sydney and Melbourne which sent the share price below $9 last year. It has been a long slog getting the share price back above $13, which was Packer's agreed selling price to Melco. But Crown's new regime has acted quickly. Switkowski only formally joined Crown as chairman on December 1. He was brought in to steady the ship alongside a small crew of new directors after two years of rolling scandals and regulatory scrutiny triggered a total clean out of Crown's board and senior management. Crown deemed Blackstone's early December bid of $12.50 as too cheap, but it was enough to offer Blackstone limited access to its books in the hope that would encourage it to go higher. With Blackstone stalking Crown for the best part of a year, one source close to the board said it had enough feedback from shareholders about what they would accept for their shares and had ""war-gamed out"" enough scenarios to be able to respond quickly. The board believes Crown shares (which closed at $11.63 on Wednesday) will certainly be worth more than $13.10 when it recovers from its regulatory woes, and tourism bounces from the pandemic. ""But not within a year"" and not without risk, the source said, making Blackstone's cash the best option for investors. Crown's endorsement of the deal wasn't strictly necessary, either. But two other sources with knowledge of the events said that after knocking back Blackstone three times since March 2021, the suitor wanted a public vote of confidence from Crown if it put another $400 million on the table (which is a raise of $840 million from its opening offer). Blackstone's takeover would need approval from NSW, Victoria and WA's gambling regulators, and has a head start after applying for probity clearance almost a year ago. Its pitch to Crown is to have cash in investors' hands by the end of June - before any rival can start its own regulatory approval process - and while The Star Entertainment Group, Crown's Sydney-based competitor and merger hopeful, is mired in its own probity scandal[https://www-smh-com-au.proxy.library.nyu.edu/business/companies/austrac-expands-probe-into-crown-suitor-the-star-20220114-p59o9b.html]. For those wondering what the future looks like for Packer, if he gets his $3 billion-plus payday and finally cuts loose from the casino operator, it probably is not that much different from his life right now. With the exit of his key lieutenants from the Crown board in February last year, after the NSW casino regulator found it unfit to hold the Barangaroo licence, Crown has effectively been just another investment in the CPH portfolio. ""During the year the company continued to seek appropriate investments,"" said the private company's most recent financial report lodged with ASIC. The accounts reported financial assets totalling more than $8.7 billion at a time when his Crown stake would have been worth well below $3 billion. CPH has been focused back on Packer's first love: Tech investing. ""Tech has always been James' interest,"" said one close associate. The One.Tel failure may loom large on his CV, but the truth is Packer has been an astute investor on this front dating back to his investments in Seek and Carsales.com.au and Zillow (now held by Gretel Packer) in what was an astute bet on the migration of print classified ads to online platforms. He has also remained close to Seek co-founder Paul Bassat. CPH was an early investor in Bassat's venture capital firm Square Peg Capital which has backed the incredibly successful graphic design startup Canva, fintech Airwallex, and Israeli freelance services marketplace Fiverr. As for Packer personally, untethering his fortunes from the business that has caused him so much anguish is not expected to change his personal life much either. ""I feel that, mentally, he is in a much better space, which is wonderful,"" said his mum, Ros Packer, during a tour of the Barangaroo work site in January 2020. ""It shattered him, with the employees in jail in China, it shattered all of us."" And while the $72 million two-storey apartment he acquired last month, atop Crown Barangaroo, gives him a home in Australia, insiders say he is unlikely to spend much time this side of the Pacific Ocean. With Packer's former wife, Erica, and three children residing in Los Angeles, the billionaire is expected to remain largely within his golden triangle of Los Angeles, Aspen, and the soon-to-be-completed mansion in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. It might just be enough that Packer feels his legacy in Australia is complete with the opening of Barangaroo as he hinted back in 2020 during that same site visit. ""I just hope it's something special that Sydney really loves."""

870,0,Your earbuds are gross: Hereâs how to clean them properly,741 words,USA Today Online,"Your TV is probably clear of nasty germs, but your phone is another story. Think about everything you touch in a day and all the times you grab your phone. Tap or click here for a guide to sanitizing your smartphone without ruining it. And then there are your earbuds. Unless you clean them regularly, crud builds up in a way that would be embarrassing if anyone else saw it. Hereâs how to get rid of it: Wiping away the crud Compared to other gadgets, earbuds rack up an extraordinary amount of nastiness. They collect dirt and skin particles, earwax, grease, and sweat. Theyâre like portable Petri dishes for our biological debris. Yuck. Luckily, itâs not hard to wipe it all away. First, grab a microfiber cloth. I like this 6-pack from EliteTechGear, which you can get for less than $10. Lightly dampen it and wipe down the cord and body of each earbud. You can use these steps for your earbudsï¿½?charging case, too, but avoid anything wet on the speaker area of your headphones. If you prefer cleaning wipes as I do, grab a big affordable pack, so you never run out. I always order Care Touchâs box of 210 wipes. Again, avoid the speaker. Pro tip: If you have white corded headphones covered in dirt and scuffs, use a pencil eraser to buff the dark streaks away. When cleaning your earbud speakers, you need to be careful. Sharp objects like toothpicks or safety pins can do severe damage. A plastic tool, like a flosser, is a safer option for scraping earwax or other buildups from around the edge. Once you're done, use a dry cloth to wipe away the junk gently. One viral TikTok trick recommends Blu Tack, the reusable adhesive putty used to hang up posters, as a safer option. Sculpt it into a ball and press it into your earbud speakers. When you pull it away, it should have picked up all the junk inside your buds. Hereâs what you need to avoid Whatever you do, don't run water over your earbuds. Sure, you can use a slightly damp cloth or cleansing wipe ï¿½?but make sure you soak up that moisture with a dry, soft, and lint-free cloth when youâre done. Avoid metal or wire brushes. Youâll also want to skip chemical detergents. Plain water should be more than enough for the cord and body of your headphones or earbuds. Of course, make sure to be super careful when you wipe ï¿½?no rough tugging or harsh pulling over the mesh speakers. Avoid any cleaners here. And once youâre done, be sure to dry your earbuds with a clean, soft cloth. Donât charge them until youâre 100% sure they are moisture-free. Bonus Tip: A unbelievable story about hackers hitting a hospital up for ransomware Ransomware hackers recently hit a hospital, and everything from the cardiac machines to IV pumps stopped working. Doctors and nurses had to use pen and paper. There were no electronic patient records. But what happened when the hackers found out it was a hospital will undoubtedly surprise you.

287,0,vaccine pass takes a bite out of struggling restaurants,1007 words,South China Morning Post,"Ray Chui Man-wai, chairman of Kam Kee Holdings, which Â­operates 44 restaurants, said his groupâs business was already down by 40 per cent following the schemeâs introduction yesterday morning, blaming the vaccine pass and a newly lowered cap on the number of diners per table for dulling peopleâs desire to eat out. âThere are quite a number of diners who still donât know how to use the vaccine pass. They think they only need to scan their âLeave Home Safeï¿½?app, but in fact they need to scan their vaccination record separately,ï¿½?he said. âOur staff need to assist them one by one.ï¿½?Under the scheme, people aged 12 and above must show proof of having received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine to enter government venues and 23 other types of premises, including restaurants, shopping centres, wet markets and supermarkets. Residents and visitors must also register their visit on the Â­governmentâs âLeaveHome Safeï¿½?risk-exposure app. Chui, who is also the chairman of the industry group Institute of Dining Art, said about 10 per cent of would-be diners yesterday morning had been prevented from entering restaurants as they had forgotten to upload their Â­vaccination record to the âLeave Home Safeï¿½?app. âMost of them were elderly people,ï¿½?he said. âThey had no idea that they needed to save their vaccination records in their app, and felt very frustrated.ï¿½?In Causeway Bay, restaurants, supermarkets and wet markets were unusually subdued Â­yesterday morning, with patrons few and far between. At Wealthy Garden, a Chinese restaurant in the area, only half the usual number of customers showed up for breakfast, Â­according to an employee who declined to be named. âThat means that we might lose 50 per cent of the revenue,ï¿½?she said, adding the Â­restaurant was popular with Â­seniors, many of whom still had not been vaccinated ï¿½?though she noted the cold weather could have also played a part. Rather than the large, chatty groups commonly seen at dim sum brunches, the restaurantâs 20 or so customers were spread out in quiet ones and twos to comply with social-distancing rules. Many were still wearing Â­protective gear, such as double masks and eye protection. Wang, an 82-year-old Â­housewife, was frustrated after being denied entry to a Â­supermarket yesterday. âI canât go anywhere without the vaccine pass now,ï¿½?she said. Though her son previously helped her install the âLeave Home Safeï¿½?app, Wang was not aware it was now needed to get into supermarkets, and had left her phone at home. Wang said she had not yet been vaccinated, and was worried about catching the virus, and also being barred from the places where she shopped for food. âI didnât have a clear answer from my doctor about whether I am fit for vaccination due to my chronic conditions,ï¿½?she said. Those with a valid medical excuse for not being jabbed are exempt from using the vaccine pass, but they must provide a doctorâs certificate. All venue employees must also be fully inoculated as part of the scheme, though they can also claim a medical exemption with a doctorâs certificate. Although checking of Â­vaccination records at shopping centres was passive, some Â­residents still needed help. A 73-year-old woman, who called herself Yip, sought help from Apple store staff in Causeway Bay to upload her vaccination record to her smartphone from a hard copy. âI wish my son was here,ï¿½?Yip said. At Harbour City mall in Tsim Sha Tsui, shopper Phoebe Chan said she took her first jab on Wednesday to fulfil vaccine pass requirements. âThe government should spend more effort controlling the pandemic, instead of controlling our normal lives,ï¿½?Chan, a 22-year-old university student, said. Residents can either present their paper vaccine certificate or upload an electronic one to âLeaveHome Safeï¿½?or other Â­government apps to create a QR code as proof of inoculation. âLeaveHome Safeï¿½?is required for entering restaurants. Data stored by the app is encrypted and will automatically be erased after 31 days. Machines installed at Â­restaurants to scan QR codes will notify staff with various sound alerts as to whether a patronâs inoculation or exemption record is valid. Exceptions to the scheme will include entering a venue to buy a takeaway or retrieve belongings, getting tested or vaccinated, attending government, legal or medical appointments, or Â­commuting home or to work. Premises such as Â­restaurants and clubhouses will also require staff to actively check patronsï¿½?inoculation or exemption records, while customers must scan a QR code before entering. Venues such as shopping Â­centres, supermarkets, department stores and wet markets will only be subject to passive checks ï¿½?providing Â­vaccination records when asked by law enforcement officers. However, a Cantonese Â­restaurant in business for more than 60 years of business said on Tuesday it would close its doors for two weeks from yesterday, as it could not complete preparations for the vaccine pass on time. âNo vaccination, no business, no life,ï¿½?Alan Yan Cheuk-lun, owner of Man Shing Restaurant in Tai Hang, said. Yan said he, his 64-year-old mother and his two brothers, who all operate the restaurant together, could not get vaccinated for Â­medical reasons. âIt is time for us to take a rest and have our body checks,ï¿½?he said. A government spokesman said restaurant staff with a certified medical exemption should undergo Covid-19 testing every seven days, while those without one would need to get their shots to return to work."

Ghee went on to work his way through many of the cityâs praised establishments ï¿½?from Shoushin to Yasu and Zen ï¿½?before finally opening a space in Scarborough in August of 2020. He designed most of the space himself. A stark contrast to the nondescript strip mall exterior, the inside of Sushi Nishinokaze is sheer minimalist beauty with a few striking accents. Seven seats sit along the L-shaped ash wood counter with 3D-printed stone wallpaper that pulls your focus to the restaurantâs sole chef: Ghee. A Yanagi knife ï¿½?a long willow blade used for slicing fish ï¿½?sits in front of him. The knife was custom-made for Ghee by a retired knife maker in Kyushu. âIf you look closely, you can see the faint markings of a full moon and Mount Fuji,ï¿½?Ghee said. Ghee landed on Sushi Nishinokazeâs location by chance. âI originally wanted to open in the city but the rent here is much more manageable,ï¿½?he said. During a recent visit, I sat next to a Michelin-star sushi chef from Chicago, âWe came to Toronto specifically to eat here. Even though it is 40 minutes from downtown by cab.ï¿½?There is no menu with Gheeâs omakase experience, you entrust the chef as he presents a hyper seasonal menu of rice and fish. For two hours Ghee holds court, offering a series of âcoursesï¿½?ï¿½?each is a meticulously sliced piece of fish that Ghee has cured in house, anywhere from a few days to two weeks. Once the fish is ready, Ghee moves his attention to his most crucial ingredient, rice. âMost sushi diners know that the fish is not the star player, the rice is 80 per cent,ï¿½?Ghee said. Ghee prepares his sushi rice manually, blending two types of rice, one is sourced from Fukushima near a volcano, the other from the mountains in Nagata. He cooks it over an open fire in a traditional cast iron pot, and flavours it with red vinegar (akazu) from Kyoto. âThis combination and technique took many years to perfect and it gives the rice the perfect blend in texture and that slight sweetness,ï¿½?Ghee said. A piece of kohada, silver fish that is currently in season, is pressed onto the rice, brushed lightly with nikiri (sweet soy sauce) and placed in front of the diner. The intention is to take the piece immediately and plop it entirely into your mouth. By the time youâve finished enjoying the course, Ghee briskly pulls another fish from a wooden box for the next course. Over the time of your seating, Ghee will present upwards of 18 courses. âI picked seven seats because the timing felt right between each course,ï¿½?Ghee said. âThere is an intimacy with omakase where it is just me and the guest.ï¿½?Suresh Doss is a Toronto-based food writer and food tour guide.

471,0,Doug McMaster interview: âZero waste is not about the individualï¿½?1854 words,Independent Online,"Chef[https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/chef] Doug McMaster leads me to the back of his restaurant[https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/restaurant], Silo[https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/silo], where he opens a cupboard and pulls out a 30-litre jug. In it is two yearsï¿½?worth of non-recyclable, non-reusable, non-compostable trash the restaurant has accumulated ï¿½?mostly oven cleaner tablet wrappers, cheese wrappers and a rubber glove with holes in it. âThis is it,ï¿½?he tells me. âThis is the trash we canât do anything with, so it sits here in this cupboard of mistakes.ï¿½?Other âmistakesï¿½?include a sack of wine corks (most of which, I discover, arenât compostable, as they are bound by a non-compostable resin), foil and wire from wine bottles, and other ingredients that have come in non-recyclable packaging. Thatâs it. The entire restaurant ï¿½?which can seat almost 50 people on any given nightï¿½?operates with the central goal of not having to put anything in the bin. Silo, which is located in Hackney Wick and overlooks the River Lee Navigation, claims to be the worldâs first zero-waste restaurant. Every minute detail of Siloâs closed-loop system has been taken into account, developed over the best part of a decade. It was first founded by McMaster in 2011 as a pop-up in Melbourne before he moved it to Brighton in 2014, and then to London in 2019. The minimal amount of waste produced by Silo is genuinely remarkable. My own household, which consists of two people and a cat, produces at least five times more waste per week that heads to landfill than the restaurant has produced in two years ï¿½?and I consider myself an eco-conscious person. From ensuring the restaurantâs produce comes straight from farms in reusable containers, to dreaming up new ways to cook, ferment or preserve food by-products, to sending inedible waste to be composted, Silo proves that there is a way for the restaurant industry to significantly reduce its food waste. However, McMaster admits, it is âvery, very difficultï¿½?and has taken a long time to get right. Once upon a time we werenât as good as turning fish bones into garum and leek tops into treacle and buttermilk into dulce de leche Doug McMaster Itâs only been in recent years that the term âclosing the loopï¿½?has emerged in the mainstream lexicon, as addressing the climate crisis became one of the dominating topics of our modern times. Closed-loop dining, also known as âcircularï¿½?dining, is a concept that aims to end the production of waste. Instead of food going into a restaurant and coming out as waste, the idea is to recycle any waste produced back into the supply chain, therefore closing the loop. This is largely still considered a new concept in the hospitality industry, and while there are a number of restaurants around the world that are beginning to take it on board, only a few operate on the same scale as Silo. McMaster explains the system he has created, describing it as ârelatively simpleï¿½?ï¿½?although it quickly becomes apparent itâs anything but. Produce is delivered in reusable crates or steel containers from farms that use regenerative agriculture, an approach that focuses on the conservation and rehabilitation of food and farming systems.  View this post on Instagram [https://www.instagram.com/p/COSiSL3HL6R/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading] A post shared by Douglas McMaster (@mcmasterchef)[https://www.instagram.com/p/COSiSL3HL6R/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading] The restaurant then takes that loose produce and prepares it in âvery maximal ways, so that we absorb between 95 to 98 per cent of the foodï¿½? which goes on the menu in various ways. By products, the parts of produce we typically throw away, is turned into other various ingredients that go into the menu at one point or another. The things that remain are inedible food waste, such as plate waste from customers, food dropped on the floor, or egg shells and the like, which all go into the compost bin. Silo works with Pale Green Dot[https://www.seedrs.com/palegreendot], a company that collects food waste from commercial kitchens and turns it into bio-fertiliser and energy, which then goes back to the ground to grow more produce for the following season. âWe used to have a compost machine, which could compost 60kg of food waste every day,ï¿½?McMaster said. âBut we now produce 20kg of food waste a week, itâs so little that turning on the compost machine -which uses an insane amount of energy ï¿½?just defeats the purpose. âItâs a brilliant problem to have. Once upon a time we werenât as good as turning fish bones into garum and leek tops into treacle and buttermilk into dulce de leche. âWe had to learn over the past decade how to turn all these by-products people throw away into, not just good food, but into restaurant-quality food. Systemically, we have excluded the production of waste. It just doesnât exist in this space.ï¿½?Itâs easy to feel inspired speaking to McMaster, whose expanse of knowledge and passion for reducing waste makes it seem like itâs something you could do at home. But this isnât the case, and McMaster is not under any illusion that going zero waste[https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/zero-waste] at home is simple or accessible for anyone without the necessary systems in place to support such a lifestyle. Systemically, we have excluded the production of waste. It just doesnât exist in this space Doug McMaster Supply chains are where everything we consume starts, and thereâs been no systemic intervention to make radical changes in the home kitchen space when it comes to going zero waste. Supermarkets are still âplastic paradiseï¿½? there has been little innovation in the home composting arena, and there are no real incentives to cut down on household waste, he says. âSilo has the luxury and the buying power to get product in massive amounts directly from a farm, so weâre dodging the use of plastic and unnecessary packaging,ï¿½?he explains. âBut at home, that logistical system falls down. Itâs not as if a single person living in a one-bedroom flat has any buying power or the ability to produce from the same sources or in the same amounts. Youâre not going to have 100 supply chains with nature at home.ï¿½?McMaster points towards bulk stores, or package-free stores as part of the solution, but acknowledges that they often only exist in more gentrified areas, therefore making them inaccessible to large swathes of the population. Apart from being few and far between, there is also the unavoidable problem that bulk stores only carry a limited amount of products and are inconvenient for the general population. At the end of the day, itâs ânot about the consumer, the individual, wanting to be zero wasteï¿½? McMaster says. âEssentially what is required to enable zero waste at home is for a whole network of people or businesses with these values to come online and become easily available to everyone. The more we talk about this, the more awareness there will be and the more demand for action from the bottom up and the top down there will be.ï¿½?There is also the defeatist attitude of some members of the public to contend with. Many have asked what the point of trying to cut down on household waste is. When the vast amount of waste comes from food manufacture -estimates from waste charity WRAP[https://wrap-org-uk.proxy.library.nyu.edu/resources/report/food-surplus-and-waste-uk-key-facts] suggest that food waste in primary production is higher than from hospitality, food service and retail combined -what difference would one household, or one restaurant make?

I like to think that my approach is to just do what Iâm doing, and if people are interested, please ask me about it and Iâll share all of my knowledge ï¿½?but I would never preach.ï¿½?This is the other remarkable thing about Silo ï¿½?you wouldnât know about its zero-waste philosophy if you didnât already know before stepping into the restaurant. McMaster says this is done deliberately, with front-of-house staff trained not to talk about anything to do with zero waste or sustainability unless they are asked about it. Itâs unusual for a restaurant to keep mum about its founding principles, given most establishments based on concepts often canât shut up about them. But McMaster is very firm about ânot preachingï¿½?sustainability, despite working âdoggedlyï¿½?behind the scenes to ensure Silo is as sustainable as possible. Quality has to come ever so slightly ahead of sustainability, because if it doesnât, weâll stop existing Doug McMaster âIt really puts people off,ï¿½?he says. âPeople are here to eat good food, this is a treat for them ï¿½?let them enjoy their experience. âIn my 10 years running Silo, Iâve seen a lot of sustainable restaurants come and go, and I honestly think that one of the reasons weâre thriving is because we lead with quality; quality food, wine, experience. âQuality has to come ever so slightly ahead of sustainability, because if it doesnât, sustainable businesses will suffer and then weâll stop existing. Then what was the point? How sustainable is a bankrupt business?ï¿½?McMasterâs book, titled Silo: The Zero Waste Blueprint, provides a roadmap for restaurants to upheave their food systems and plan for a future of limited resources. He also started the Zero Waste Cooking School on Instagram to teach people ways of reducing food and plastic waste in their own kitchens. His next big mission is a book that will ask us to imagine a world that is zero waste by examining âall the pressure points in the global food system and creating solutionsï¿½? he says. âWhat if we can apply these solutions to a village? Why not a town, a city, a nation, the planet?ï¿½?Read More âA future full of risksï¿½?

191,1,"LIC IPO: Centre Wooing Sovereign, Pension Funds Tata Sons Recasts Air India Board",512 words,The Economic Times - Bangalore Edition,"The funds had shown interest and the government wants to confirm their participation, said officials involved in the offer. ET had reported earlier this week that the IPO is likely to be held toward the end of this month. ""Many leading sovereign funds have expressed interest in the LIC IPO. Merchant bankers are in advanced discussions with them for being anchor investors in the issue,"" one of the officials told ET. The government is keen on their participation as these funds are stable investors with a long-term horizon, the person said. The government had reached out to about 180 potential anchor investors during roadshows. Officials feel at least 8-10 big-ticket foreign investors will be required as anchor investors for the IPO, set to be the biggest ever Indian public offer. In December last year, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had extended the lock-in period for anchor investors to 90 days from 30 days earlier. The market regulator also removed restrictions on the maximum number of anchor investors for public issues in excess of `250 crore. At an estimated embedded value of `5.4 lakh crore, the Centre may raise `60,000-70,000 crore through the 5% stake sale in LIC. The anchor investment portion is expected to be around `18,000 crore. Tata Sons has recast the board of Air India, moving the airline's executives who held board positions to senior management roles. It has also appointed a chief commercial officer, and heads of human resources, digital and technology, customer experience and ground handling at the airline. Anirban Chowdhury reports. According to the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) filed with Sebi, the insurer will allocate 60% of the qualified institutional buyers' (QIBs) portion to anchor investors on a discretionary basis. Strong anchor investments give confidence to retail and other institutional investors, helping generate demand for IPO when it opens to the general public. The official said that while the discussions were going on, there is still no firm commitment on the quantum of the investment they were likely to make. ""That will happen when we zero in on the final issue price and when it is communicated to them. The process is on and we will do it soon,"" the official said, without giving a timeline. One key consideration is the listing price and the market capitalisation at that level. Anything below `10.7 lakh crore valuation at listing can make inclusion in the MSCI index difficult, said the official. The government has budgeted `65,000 crore from disinvestment in the current financial year."

The company already employs about 400 people locally, but Benck said the company will need to hire several hundred more in the next 18 months. The Covid-19 pandemic has sparked labor shortages in a variety of fields, including manufacturing, and with new projects coming to the state regularly, companies are in a fierce fight to fill thousands of jobs now and in the coming years. Already this year, the National Association of Manufacturers estimated that there were more than 11,000 manufacturing job openings in Arizona during the first 45 days of 2022. Nestle[https://www-bizjournals-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/phoenix/news/2022/03/07/new-details-revealed-large-manufacturing-facility.html?utm_source=st&utm_medium=en&utm_campaign=BN&utm_content=ph&ana=e_ph_BN&j=26940774&senddate=2022-03-07], Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Intel Corp., Lucid Group Inc., KORE Power, General Dynamics, Honeywell and Raytheon are just a few of the Arizona companies looking to fill manufacturing jobs. Plus, South Korea-based electronics giant LG could soon join the hunt for workers as it is planning to build a $2.8 billion battery plant in Queen Creek, which the company says would create 2,800 jobs. Arizonaâs manufacturing industry grew 21% from the beginning of 2011 to the end of 2021, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a pace well ahead of the national rate of 2.02% during the same period. Regionally, Arizona is the largest manufacturing employer, with an estimated 184,700 people in the field at the end of January. Arizonaâs manufacturers outsize Colorado, Utah, Nevada and New Mexico, but Arizona is dwarfed by California, which is the largest manufacturer in the country with more than 1.2 million people in the sector. Additionally, old seats of manufacturing power ï¿½?such as Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Pennsylvania ï¿½?are still among the largest in the country. Even though Arizonaâs manufacturing workforce has grown significantly in the past decade, it was still ranked just the 25th largest in the nation at the end of 2021. Because of the increased demand for skilled labor, Arizona's colleges and universities are playing an essential role in building new programs to train engineers and other manufacturing workers through boot camps, apprenticeships, internships and more. Industry has realized that working with students, even as early as middle school, helps learners discover ways to turn their interests into a livelihood. This early exposure not only alerts students to career possibilities, it also helps to dispel antiquated notions that factory work is low-tech or low-skill.  Arizona State University is a major factor in the region's manufacturing sector, thanks to its engineering school which turns out thousands of graduates each semester. ASU has created the Advanced Manufacturing Science and Technology Center, on its Polytechnic Campus in Mesa specifically to prepare students to join high-end manufacturing operations. The school is also working on a public-private program called the Arizona Workforce Training Accelerator Partnership for Next Generation Jobs, or AZ Next, thanks to an $8 million grant[https://www-bizjournals-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/phoenix/news/2021/03/31/arizona-fill-thousands-of-jobs-manufacturing-boom.html] the board of regents received from the Department of Labor last year. The AZ Next program is shaping its curricula with input from Honeywell, Offerpad, TPI Composites and many other partners[https://wpcarey.asu.edu/aznext]. Community colleges are also adapting their curricula to better serve labor market needs. In Casa Grande, Central Arizona College partnered with the state to create Drive48, a program specifically designed to train people to work in the nearby Lucid factory. The program launched last year and has already trained[https://centralaz.edu/news-announcements/open-house-to-be-held-at-new-drive48-training-center/] 400 new hires. Maricopa Community Colleges has reshaped some its programs to be shorter and more concentrated after consulting with local employers. Leah Palmer, the executive director at MCCâs Arizona Advanced Manufacturing Institute, said just before the pandemic her team was approached by Boeing which needed 450 electrical wiring technicians in the coming years. Palmer and the AMI team worked with Boeing to design a boot camp that could quickly educate students on essential topics and connect them to job opportunities, at Boeing and elsewhere. After seeing Boeing's success, Intel approached the AMI team last year with the goal of creating a similar program for the semiconductor industry. The resulting program is called Quick Start, which is a four-week course designed to expedite career changers' journey into the industry by giving them a new industry-recognized certification upon completion. The program was designed to bring greater diversity into the industry and the first cohort, which starts in May, is entirely female. The course tuition, $270, is also being completely subsidized by the state of Arizona, further expanding access to interested students. âIt has truly been an assembly line model previously, where students opt in, they go to a program, and when they're finished, industry waits for them to apply,ï¿½?Palmer said of the old way of connecting students to work. âWhat is happening with this Quick Start program is we're taking it even a step further. We're actually bringing industry to interview on the sites of the campuses to remove any security barriers or difficulty in students being where they are and industry finding them.ï¿½? Intel is looking to fill 500 jobs this year, a first wave of the 3,000 it needs to staff in new fabs[https://www-bizjournals-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/phoenix/news/2021/09/24/intel-breaks-ground-fab-52-62.html] under construction in Chandler. In addition to partnering with local colleges[https://www-bizjournals-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/phoenix/news/2022/04/13/intel-debuts-two-workforce-development-programs-to.html] to produce new prospects, Intel is also turning to people that have been out of the labor force; Intel recently launched[https://www-intel-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/content/www/us/en/jobs/relaunch-your-career.html] what it calls a âreturnshipï¿½?for people to return to working after time away. The returnship is a 16-week program for people with resume gaps who are looking to get back into work, one group particularly interested has proven to be women who paused their careers to raise children. Additionally, ahead of its 2024 opening, TSMC has openings in 66 positions, including engineering and technician roles, but according to a spokesperson, each role could require the hiring of dozens, if not hundreds. So far, the company has more than 500 new Arizona hires training in Taiwan. Plus, TSMC already has some support staff working in temporary office space on Dunlap Avenue in Phoenix, and other employees are working at the TSMC construction site in north Phoenix. Manufacturers, like all employers in the Covid-19 era, are having to adjust their recruiting pitch to prospective employees. These companies cannot offer as many remote work options, but soft benefits and company culture still help employers stand out from other options. Mary Foote, executive director of PipelineAZ ï¿½?a career navigation platform for workers and employers in Arizona ï¿½?said manufacturers in particular are always looking for a way to differentiate themselves from their competitors. PipelineAZ is a project under the Partnership for Economic Innovation and it currently has more than 5,000 employers on its platform. âMy recommendation to companies is always, when you hire someone, think about their professional pathway, in your company and beyond your company,ï¿½?she said. âPeople want to know that there are opportunities for upskilling, for progression.ï¿½? Benchmark's Benck said his company has embraced this idea and realized that most people will not work their full career at a single company. âWe think of our employees now as âhow do we think about getting five great years out of an employee?âï¿½?he said. âHopefully they stay longer and we certainly want them to be able to build a career, butï¿½?you probably won't end your career at the company you work for today.ï¿½?With that in mind, Benck said Benchmark is aiming to give workers opportunities to grow and take on interesting assignments. The company is also putting an emphasis on building a diverse and inclusive workplace, a priority that most manufacturers never considered in decades past. Benchmark, which grew its revenue by 10% from 2020 to 2021, has more than 10,000 employees in Asia, Europe and North America. The company has more than 3.75 million square feet of manufacturing space around the world, about 40% of which is in the U.S. and 38% in Asia. Of those 10,000 employees, about half are women.  Benchmark established its first ever Inclusion Council in January and the company has also made changes to its board to have better representation of women and people of color. This type of representation matters, Benck said, not just to investors and customers, but employees too. âEmployees care more now, particularly the younger population that's just coming out of school,ï¿½?he said. âThere's a more socially conscious, environmentally conscious employee now.ï¿½?What's more, Benck said Benchmark helped build numerous life-saving products during the pandemic, including ventilators and PCR test equipment, a feat which he said shows that manufacturing work matters and helps impact the world.

438,1,"Honda to drive in more vehicles, hybrids to grow profitably, says CEO Takuya Tsumura",916 words,The Economic Times,"That is why we did some transformations and, fortunately, were at a profitable level last year. So, from now on, it is time to again reinforce our business here. We will introduce City eHEV and a new model next year to expand our business. What is your initial impression of the Indian market?I was in South Asia from 1997 to 2000. I was in charge of India start up project. I can compare from that past and now. Of course, there has been rapid growth in the market, many players are here now. The Honda City is already in its fifth generation and still maintaining the good position. In its segment, City has the number one position. The Amaze also is second in its class. We have created a strong brand.You have worked in several markets, including Thailand, China and Japan. Why do you think in India vehicle penetration remains low despite a burgeoning population?I think the Indian market is stable. The industry has been growing, the pace was quite good. In FY19, sales (of passenger vehicles) touched about 3.37 million units. But unfortunately, we have had serious situations like the transition from Bharat Stage IV to BSVI, Covid-19, semiconductors (shortage), and the rise in raw material price. So, I will say the Indian industry saw strong growth. However, there's a rough patch. I'm sure the industry will bounce back. You already have 1.4 billion population here. I believe it (growth) is really coming.Honda today unveiled the hybrid technology in the City. What will be your fuel strategy in the Indian market going ahead?Our president (Toshihiro Mibe of Honda Motor Company) has announced the direction, the EV strategy for future. The goal is to achieve carbon neutrality with our products by 2050. By 2030, we are planning to produce two million electric vehicles, globally. We are in the planning stage for many things for the market (here). But I think it (hybrid) is the first reasonable step. At this moment, itâs most reachable (and) practical model that we can introduce, and I have confidence with that one. The City is a very important model. With this eHEV, I believe that we give more opportunity to users to drive stress free, (there is) no need to consider, we donât have the charging station next 50 km or something. It's really one of the good solutions at this time. But, of course, again, our future direction we already know. So, when the time comes, we need to introduce the EV.Currently, taxes on hybrid vehicles are steep, which could make it less affordable for your consumer set. Have you made, or are you planning to make, any representation for relook at the tax structure?Of course, we are one of the members of SIAM (Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers). In SIAM, we have the opportunity to talk about that issue. The parliament committee (has) also suggested to have a lower GST tax on hybrid because it has low initial cost and a better ROI (return on investment). We are closely working with the central government as well as regional governments to realise better tax structure for everything.With the new City and an SUV coming in next year, what kind of growth are you expecting mid-term?It is still very difficult (to predict growth) with the Russian-Ukraine conflict and the issue of Covid in China. The condition is almost same with everyone in the industry. We are forecasting some growth this year in the market. We are believing at least a similar level of the growth we can do. We are planning to launch a SUV next year and this market is now growing a lot. Unfortunately, we don't have the model in there, but we are planning to introduce models. So then, of course, we believe we will see sales increase with that one.Is there some visibility currently regarding some relief from the high inputs costs and semiconductor shortages that have been plaguing the auto industry?It's not clear. Suddenly, many issues have come in. When I was in Turkey last year, I heard from the Japan side that in the first half of the year, we will still have the problem of chip shortage. Second half will be better. But I don't see any good situation now. Similarly, with commodity prices, it is unclear (when it will soften). For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
606,0,Omicron lowers sales and threatens bankruptcy for US restaurants,380 words,The Boston Globe,"The sharp hit to restaurants nationwide demonstrates the pandemic's continuing blow to the industry, despite national efforts to avoid economic pitfalls from shutdowns this winter. The impact is particularly challenging for businesses that didn't get funding from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, a $28.6 billion federal effort to rescue struggling businesses that was part of the American Rescue Fund. Four out of five businesses that did not receive grants said they were in danger of permanently closing in 2022. The fund provided as much as $5 million per location for restaurant owners -- or as much as $10 million per business -- who could demonstrate their businesses experienced significant financial distress during the pandemic. Restaurateur Dwayne Allen, owner of The Breadfuit in Phoenix, Arizona, said the pandemic forced him to shut down in-restaurant dining in March 2020. For the past two years, he worked to keep the business afloat by introducing catering, take-out, pop-ups and community partnerships. He applied for an RRF grant, but did not receive one. Now, Allen said the efforts to keep the restaurant afloat brought him into tens of thousands of dollars of debt, and he's losing hope of ever reopening the restaurant without external financial support. In addition to a drop in sales, restaurants also struggled with staffing shortages and increased costs due to rising wages. Nearly half of restaurants that did not receive pandemic relief said they were forced to lay off staff because of the surge in cases, compared to a third of those who did receive funding. Nearly half of restaurants also said that the cost and availability of COVID tests impacted their ability to do business."

720,0,How to Keep the Rising Tide of Fake News From Drowning Our Democracy,2053 words,NYTimes.com Feed,"Today we live in an era of âcheap speech.ï¿½?Eugene Volokh, a First Amendment scholar at U.C.L.A., coined the term [https://www2-law-ucla-edu.proxy.library.nyu.edu/volokh/cheap.pdf] in 1995 to refer to a new period marked by changes in communications technology that would allow readers, viewers and listeners to receive speech from a practically infinite variety of sources unmediated by traditional media institutions, like newspapers, that had served as curators and gatekeepers. He was correct back then that the amount of speech flowing to us in formats like video would move from a trickle to a flood. What Professor Volokh did not foresee in his largely optimistic prognostication was that our information environment would become increasingly âcheapï¿½?in a second sense of the word, favoring speech of little value over speech that is more valuable to voters. It is expensive to produce quality journalism but cheap to produce polarizing political âtakesï¿½?and easily shareable disinformation. The economic model for local newspapers and news gathering has collapsed over the past two decades; from 2000 to 2018, journalists lost jobs faster [https://observer.com/2018/10/jobs-trump-coal-miners-journalism/] than coal miners. While some false claims spread inadvertently, the greater problem is not this misinformation but deliberately spread disinformation, which can be both politically and financially profitable [https://onezero.medium.com/why-facebook-cant-quash-qanon-abaf6671b376]. Feeding people reassuring lies on social media or cable television [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/us/politics/alex-jones-jan-6-trump.html] that provide simple answers to complex social and economic problems increases demand for more soothing falsities, creating a vicious cycle.

The rise of cheap speech poses special dangers for American democracy and for faith and confidence in American elections. To put the matter bluntly, if we had the polarized politics of today but the information technology of the 1950s, we almost certainly would not have seen the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, at the United States Capitol. Millions of Republican voters [https://www-washingtonpost-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/politics/2022/01/07/republicans-big-lie-trump/] would probably not have believed the false claims [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/19/opinion/trump-big-lie.html] that the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump and demanded from state legislatures new restrictive voting rules [https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-december-2021] and fake election âauditsï¿½?[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/us/cyber-ninjas-arizona-vote-review.html] to counter phantom voter fraud.

In an earlier era, the three major television networks, The Times and local newspaper and television stations would most likely have been more active in mediating and curtailing the rhetoric of a president spewing dangerous nonsense.

They are more likely to see the current government as illegitimate and to refuse to follow government guidance on public health, the environment and other issues crucial to health and safety. They are comparatively likely to see violence as a means of resolving political grievances. But cheap speech has already done damage to our democracy and has the potential to do even more. The demise of local newspapers ï¿½?and their replacement in some cases with partisan or even foreign sources [https://www-washingtonpost-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/technology/2020/09/01/facebook-disinformation-takedown/] of information masquerading as legitimate journalism ï¿½?fosters a loss of voter competence, as voters have a harder time getting objective information about candidatesï¿½?records and positions.

Mr. Jones, a Democrat, narrowly won that election, though we cannot say that the disinformation campaign swung the result. The cheap speech environment increases polarization and the risk of demagogy by individual candidates. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who before entering Congress embraced dangerous QAnon conspiracy theories and supported the execution [https://www-cnn-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/2021/01/26/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-democrats-violence/index.html] of Democratic politicians, need not depend upon party leaders for funding; by being outrageous, she can go right to social media to cheaply raise funds [https://www.vox.com/22372051/marjorie-taylor-greene-campaign-donations-republican-primary-midterms] for her campaigns and political activities. We now live in an era of high partisanship but weak political parties, which can no longer serve as the moderating influence on extremists within their ranks. Cheap speech accelerates this trend. We cannot ï¿½?and would not want to ï¿½?go back to a time when media gatekeepers deprived voters of valuable information. Cheap speech helped fuel Black Lives Matter protests and the racial justice movement both before and after the murder of George Floyd, and virally spread videos of police misconduct can help catalyze meaningful change. But the cheap speech era requires new legal tools to shore up our democracy. Among the legal changes that could help are an updating of campaign finance laws to cover what is now mostly unregulated political advertising disseminated over the internet, labeling deep fakes as âalteredï¿½?to help voters separate fact from fiction and a tightening of the ban on foreign campaign expenditures. Congress should also make it a crime to lie about when, where and how people vote. A Trump supporter has been charged [https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/douglass-mackey-ricky-vaughn-memes-first-amendment] with targeting voters in 2016 with false messages [https://www-justice-gov.proxy.library.nyu.edu/opa/press-release/file/1360816/download] suggesting that they could vote by text or social media post, but it is not clear if existing law makes such conduct illegal. We also need new laws aimed at limiting microtargeting [https://www-washingtonpost-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/politics/2021/10/26/facebook-knew-ads-microtargeting-could-be-exploited-by-politicians-it-accepted-risk/], the use by campaigns or interest groups of intrusive data collected by social media companies to send political ads, including some misleading ones, sometimes to vulnerable populations. Unfortunately, the current Supreme Court would very likely view many of these proposed legal changes as violating the First Amendmentâs free speech guarantees. Much of the courtâs jurisprudence depends upon faith in an outmoded âmarketplace of ideasï¿½?metaphor, which assumes that the truth will emerge through counterspeech. If that was ever true in the past, it is not true in the cheap speech era. Today, the clearest danger to American democracy is not government censorship but the loss of voter confidence and competence that arises from the sea of disinformation and vitriol. Whatâs worse, some justices on the court who otherwise fashion themselves as free speech libertarians have lately espoused positions that could exacerbate our problems. Justice Clarence Thomas, for example, has indicated that he would most likely treat [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20-197_5ie6.pdf] social media companies like telephone companies and allow states to pass laws requiring them not to deplatform politicians who violate the companiesï¿½?terms of use (as Facebook and Twitter did to Mr. Trump), even those who constantly spread election disinformation and encourage political violence. Justice Thomas and Justice Neil Gorsuch have also signaled [https://www-law-cornell-edu.proxy.library.nyu.edu/supremecourt/text/20-1063] an interest in loosening up libel laws, as Mr. Trump has urged [https://www-politico-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/blogs/on-media/2016/02/donald-trump-libel-laws-219866], making it harder for legitimate journalists to expose or criticize the actions of politicians. Even if Congress adopted all the changes I have proposed and the Supreme Court upheld them ï¿½?two quite unlikely propositions ï¿½?it would hardly be enough to sustain American democracy in the cheap speech era. For example, the First Amendment would surely bar a law that would require social media companies to remove demagogic candidates who undermine election integrity from social media platforms; we would not want a government bureaucrat (under the control of a partisan president) to make such a call. But such speech is among the greatest dangers we face today. Thatâs why efforts to deal with the costs of cheap speech require political action as well. As consumers and voters, we need to pressure social media companies and other platforms to protect our democracy by taking strong steps, including deplatforming political figures in extreme circumstances [https://www-politico-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/f/?id=00000177-8e40-df6c-abf7-ae726a9b0000], when they consistently undermine election integrity and foment or threaten violence. Twitterâs recent decision [https://www-cnn-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/2022/01/28/politics/twitter-lies-2020-election/index.html] to no longer remove false speech about the integrity of the 2020 election is a step in the wrong direction. And if the social media companies are unresponsive to consumer pressure or become too powerful in controlling the political speech environment, the solution is to use antitrust laws to create more competition. Society needs to figure out ways to subsidize real investigative journalism efforts, especially locally, like the excellent journalism of The Texas Tribune andThe Nevada Independent, two relatively new news-gathering organizations that depend on donors and a nonprofit model. Journalistic bodies should use accreditation methods to send signals to voters and social media companies about which content is reliable and which is counterfeit. Over time and with a lot of effort, we can reestablish greater faith in real journalism, at least for a significant part of the population. The most important steps to counter cheap speech are the hardest to take. We need to rebuild civil society to strengthen reliable intermediaries and institutions that engage in truth telling. As a starting point, think of all the institutions Mr. Trump tried to undermine: the free press, the opposition party, his own party, the judiciary and the F.B.I., to name just a few. And we need an educational effort ï¿½?including among older Americans, who are actually the most likely [https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/9/18174631/old-people-fake-news-facebook-share-nyu-princeton] to spread political misinformation ï¿½?to inculcate the values of truth, respect for science and the rule of law. This is easier said than done. It will require an all-hands-on-deck mobilization and not just the government: civics groups, bar and professional associations, religious institutions, labor unions and businesses all have a role to play. The future of American democracy in the cheap speech era is hardly ensured. We donât have all the solutions and canât even foresee political problems that will come with the next technological shift. But legal and political action taken now has the best chance of giving voters the tools to make competent decisions and reject election lies that will continue to spew forth on every platform that can be built to threaten the foundation of our democracy.

383,1,BULGARIA: ALLTERCO REVENUE UP IN Q1 2022,503 words,Business World Magazine,"The successful results of the first quarter are a continuation of the positive growth trend of the technology company from 2021. Its growth continues not only with investments in the development and introduction of new devices but also with the development of work organization to achieve ambitious strategic goals that Allterco sets for the coming years. Last week, the company announced the appointment of Wolfgang Kirsch as CEO of Allterco, a role he would share with one of its founders, Dimitar Dimitrov. In the new structure of the company, Dimitar Dimitrov will head the R&D team, whose main focus is research and development related to the creation and development of new devices from the two sub-brands of Allterco - Shelly home automation line and GPS smartwatch line for children MyKi. At the same time, Wolfgang Kirsch will be responsible for the operational management of the company with a focus on sales, marketing, logistics, finance and human resources. ""The financial results achieved in the first quarter of the year are proof that we are going in the right direction when it comes to expanding our business. And the appointment of Wolfgang Kirsch as second CEO is a major part of it. The secondary listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange was a clear signal of our ambitions to be one of the key players in the European market and with his deep knowledge of the industry and proven experience Wolfgang Kirsch is the right person to help us achieve this,"" said Dimitar Dimitrov. ""Being part of Allterco in such exciting times is a pleasure and an honor. Preliminary results for the first quarter with a growth in sales revenue of +26% compared to the first quarter of 2021 are proof of the excellent performance of the team, especially since we had a very strong performance in the first quarter of 2021. This shows that our global team is united and ready to meet our goals for this year as well. We are determined to grow at an even faster pace in the coming quarters,"" said Wolfgang Kirsch. Earlier this year, Allterco announced a 51% increase in sales revenue for 2021 with more than 30 million euros in sales revenue on a consolidated basis. Allterco's high results have been achieved in the context of the successful launch of 10 new devices and 2 new product lines in just one year. (Novinite/Business World Magazine)"

458,0,Greece allows music in bars and restaurants again,228 words,Cyprus Mail,"âWe have decided to scale back the restrictions, taking into consideration the course of the pandemic in terms of cases which have been declining in recent weeks,ï¿½?Health Minister Thanos Plevris said in a televised statement. He said that despite ongoing pressure on the health system, the rate of hospital admissions and discharges and a shorter duration and less severe illness for the Omicron variant compared to Delta allowed authorities to ease the curbs. Capacity restrictions will remain in place for sport events, while a double mask is mandatory in supermarkets and transport. Greece reported 19,712 new cases on Thursday. Infections have been easing since a record high of around 50,000 in early January. A total of 23,083 deaths linked to COVID-19 have been reported since February 2020 and 1,867,935 cases out of a population of 11 million people."
509,0,G-20 meetings are a ray a hope for Bali's resort and conference centres,800 words,The Straits Times,"The meetings represent the biggest and best chance since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic for the island's resort and conference centres to steal a march on competition emerging in places like Thailand where quarantine standards have been relaxed in a bid to woo visitors. The wild card though remains the pandemic. The kick-off event in early December comprising senior officials from the finance ministries and central banks of G-20 members coincided with the onset of the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus. Only half of the 300 or so officials in attendance were foreign delegates. ""Flexibility will be crucial for us when it comes to the nation's success in being host of the G-20,"" said Mr Orial Montal, the general manager Westin Resort Nusa Dua, which along with venues including the Bali Nusa Dua Convention Centre will be where conferences and meetings will be held. Until the onset of the pandemic, the income from conventions and conference business was ballast for hotels and resorts, helping TO steady income between the seasonal ups and downs of leisure traffic. Mr Montal said that the Westin typically earned 30 per cent of its revenue from conferences and events. The G20 meetings this year would help generate 33,000 jobs in Bali, the government has said. Also, establishing Bali as a trusted site for international conferences is a source of soft power for Indonesia. A decade ago the government spent roughly 3.5 trillion rupiah building the Bali Nusa Dua Convention Centre (BNDCC) - capable of hosting 10,000 people a stone's throw from the Westin - and a tollway linking the site with the island's international airport. Since then the site in Nusa Dua has hosted climate, political and financial events including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund summit in 2018. This year marks the first time Indonesia has hosted the G-20. But the pandemic has sent some of those properties scrambling. Data is tough to come by but global spending on conferences by international associations, for example, shrunk last year to US$1.7 billion (S$2.30 billion) from nearly US$11 billion the year earlier as clients cancelled meetings or shifted them online, bypassing hotel stays, according to data from International Congress and Convention Association. Mr Yoga Angga Muda, director of sales for BNDCC, said the convention centre was relying more on government contracts as it recovered from the sharp slowdown in business. ""During the recovery phase in 2022, we are focusing on the government sector with a slight pick-up business from the corporate sector,"" Mr Yoga told ST, adding that he foresaw a turnaround next year. ""In 2023, we already have business on-hand from international association meetings."" To be sure, containing the Omicron variant of the coronavirus will not be easy. Expect smaller meetings overlaid with more safety protocols. In November the Westin said it hosted 500 athletes, officials and referees attending the International Badminton Festival in something approaching a bubble. The event was sealed off from the wider public. For the G-20, the resort will make use of a premium hotel on its property that can also be sealed off from the public. Delegates arrive on charter flights and are whisked to the resort, hotel officials said, adding that their operating procedures will change with Covid-19 conditions. Still, Mr Montal is confident that despite the headaches that Covid 19 has caused, demand from clients to host in-person meetings is set to recover. ""I'm very optimistic about the second half of 2022,"" Mr Montal said. ""Face- to- face meetings are coming back."" Indonesia has said it will use its presidency of the G20 to prod member countries to improve vaccine production and prevent the next pandemic, spur digital finance and renewable energy. ""We will host your excellencies in the open air, on the beautiful stretch of Bali beaches, which inspires innovative ideas for the productivity of G-20 in the future,"" President Joko Widodo said in Rome last November upon assuming the presidency of the grouping from Italy. ""See you in Indonesia."""

710,0,New York Times pulls journalists from Russia amid media crackdown,626 words,Washington Post.com,"She added that the Times ""will continue our live, robust coverage of the war, and our rigorous reporting on Russia's offensive in Ukraine and these attempts to stifle independent journalism."" Meanwhile, the BBC took a step in the opposite direction, saying Tuesday it would resume reporting from Russia after a four-day hiatus. The BBC was one of several media organizations that announced Friday they would cease reporting and broadcasting from the country, or in the country, but no others have yet said they will remove all editorial personnel. Bloomberg News editor in chief John Micklethwait said the global news organization would ""temporarily suspend our newsgathering inside Russia,"" arguing that the changed criminal code ""makes it impossible to continue any semblance of normal journalism inside the country."" He said that Bloomberg News ""will obviously continue to support our staff in the country, even if for now they can no longer do their jobs there."" (The news organization has 27 reporters, editors and translators based in Russia.) Major American television news networks have largely stopped broadcasting from the country, and CNN said on Friday that its programming would not be visible in the country, so as to protect the network and its employees ï¿½?though the network did not announce plans to evacuate personnel from the country. A spokesperson for ABC News said on Friday that the network ""will continue to assess the situation and determine what this means for the safety of our teams on the ground,"" beyond deciding not to broadcast from the country. A Post spokeswoman, Shani George, said on Saturday that the newspaper is ""continuing to seek clarity about whether Russia's new restrictions will apply to international news organizations,"" although in the meantime it is removing bylines and datelines from specific stories as a means of protecting Russia-based contributors. ""We want to be sure that our Moscow-based correspondents are not held responsible for material that is produced from beyond Russia,"" she added. Independent media outlets in Russia have also been crushed by Russian President Vladimir Putin's crackdown, with many reporters fleeing the country. The Committee to Protect Journalists has implored Russian officials to allow local and international media outlets to operate freely. ""The Russian public cannot be deprived of information and news and be forced to rely on the Kremlin-approved interpretation of events at this very important time in Russian history,"" Gulnoza Said, the committee's Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, said in a statement late last week. ""The censorship must stop, and bans must be lifted."" The BBC issued a statement Tuesday saying that it would resume broadcasting from Russia again later in the day. ""We will tell this crucial part of the story independently and impartially, adhering to the BBC's strict editorial standards,"" the statement said. ""The safety of our staff in Russia remains our number one priority."" SEE ALSO: Russia's independent media, long under siege, teeters under new Putin crackdown"
143,0,"As Olympic torch is lit in hope, I see light at end of the tunnel",790 words,The Herald,"When Ivy League universities in America are closing their doors and sending students home until August, donât rule out the first cancellation of an Olympic Games since World War II.? The IOC and host nation Japan are still confident that the Games will go ahead as planned, but no one has any real idea on how long this might go on for. Just from athletes I have spoken to, there is definitely real concern over the Games. The concern isnât just over whether the games get cancelled or not. For each individual athlete, it is also over their own preparations. As an athlete, getting sick is never great and if you got this virus bad you might face missing weeks of training. It could result on you missing the podium in Tokyo.? Or missing the Games altogether. Another friend of mine told me of his concerns that if they move the Games then he might not even get selected.? With markets crashing and supermarket shelves being cleared, these are definitely interesting times for everybody. But when you are living during this Covid-19 pandemic with a spinal-cord injury I guess it becomes even more daunting ï¿½?as such an injury can remove your cough and sneeze reflex. With very little core function, the thought of not being able to cough is a pretty scary proposition.? This might not sound too bad. But this virus hits elderly people hard ï¿½?and this also includes your biological age due to underlying medical conditions. So this is a scary time, and I completely feel for everyone in the same boat as me how scary this is.?I remember back to catching the flu in November last year ï¿½?I thought I was going to stop breathing. I couldnât cough to clear my lungs as the level of my injury is right at the nerves which go to the lungs.? It knocked me out for weeks, so I would be lying if I said I wasnât slightly scared of Covid-19 and its possible effects on my lungs.? I am a very optimistic person who always looks for solutions over problems. But I must admit this has got me a little bit shaken.? Watching whatâs happening in Italy has been hard to believe ï¿½?particularly as life seemed to be continuing almost as normal here.? I looked at the MRI of a 44-year-old manâs lungs and it was unbelievable, unfortunately he didnât survive.? So I am staying positive but also taking advice from Austrian neurologist Viktor Frankl.?He speaks of acceptance of your current situation. These are his own words ï¿½?which I have had on my wall for the last four years: âThe meaning of life lies in finding a purpose and taking responsibility for ourselves and other human beings.ï¿½? In other words, by having a clear âwhyï¿½?we can face all the âhowï¿½?questions of life. This has got me through all those hours in hospital and continues to serve me daily.? Thereâs a reason that in-flight safety presentations always instruct us to secure our own oxygen masks before assisting fellow passengers. We canât help others effectively unless we first protect ourselves. So I spoke with a medical oncologist friend and they advised me to self-isolate.? I am now on day four and thinking this could be a long road ahead; thankfully the weather is getting warmer and I got out on my bike for a few laps of Richmond Park. Along with indoor turbo sessions I am well prepared mentally for the process. I guess all my time in hospital equipped my mind to deal with self-isolating. It also probably helps being an introvert.? I canât help but think of the poor people undergoing their cancer treatment right now though, as I prepare for my own hospital appointment in a few weeks, but I am grateful that side of things is under control. My main goal is keeping my immune system strong because another issue I have from my spinal-cord injury is a compromised immune system, thus moving me into a vulnerable group.? Itâs hard to go from a strong athlete to now feeling so vulnerable, but thankfully I have a strong mind."
969,0,Luxury housing in high demand during Covid times,766 words,Financial Express Online,"The COVID-19 has compelled consumers to seek homes that reflect their personalities; luxury has grown from a snobbish connotation to a sphere of family health and wellness. The lifestyle requirement led to the increase in demand for a price category above Rs 75 lakh. According to housing.com data, demand for homes in Delhi NCR priced between Rs 75 lakh and Rs 1 crore is 13%, and for homes priced above Rs 1 crore is 24%. The figures are an indication of the increasing demand for luxury homes in Delhi NCR; however, the trend is not limited to this region, but is evident across India. In Delhi-NCR, Noida has emerged as the preferred destination after it pipped out other areas through constant infrastructural development that indirectly extolled buyers to look at the city as an ideal destination for living. The city has always been known for the planned development, and the latest infrastructural additions have tilted the scales towards the city. The luxury market, more than other segments, moves according to the business opportunities a place or nearby area has on offer. The infrastructure development has recently opened up opportunities for setting up business in Noida, which has increased the likelihood of premium buyers migrating to the region. PM Narendra Modi laid the foundation for Noida International Airport recently, which will attract a lot of investment from various industries. A new section of the corporate class, including HNIs and UHNIs, will be evaluating the city for long-term income opportunities due to seamless connectivity and high-end infrastructural developments such as Film City. The demand for properties for businessmen and senior executives will continue to rise. Noida is planning an âElectronic Parkï¿½?for electronic products and accessories along the Yamuna Expressway, following Toy Park, Film City, Medical Device Park, and Leather Park. The park is planned to bring in Rs 50,000 crore in investment and provide jobs. The park would most likely be built in either Sector 14 or Sector 10 of the YEIDA near Jewar Airport, covering a total size of 250 acres. All of these changes will result in a significant increase in the demand for real estate development, both residential and commercial. The time is right to invest in Noida and Greater Noida. The encouraging market movement is supported by various industry reports also. A CII-ANAROCK Consumer Sentiment Survey underscored how radically COVID-19 has altered homebuyersï¿½?preferences. The survey also pointed out that âfor the first time, affordable housing is the lowest priority, with more than 34% respondent home seekers focused on properties priced between INR 90 lakh to INR 2.5 Cr. NRI participants in the survey primarily preferred luxury properties priced between INR 1.5-2.5 Crore.ï¿½?Investor confidence in real estate has risen; branded developers dominate the new housing supply, and buyers consider them safe bets. Since the first unlock last year, the real estate sector, particularly the residential segment, has shown encouraging growth; the sector has suffered unforeseen challenges due to the COVID issue, but it has maintained its lustre. In fact, there has been an increase in demand for larger homes that prioritise residentsï¿½?health. The percentage share of premium and luxury goods in overall sales will continue to rise. There was a time when Noida and Greater Noida were seen as the destination for middle-class buyers with luxury restricted to providing bigger homes in a few projects. However, the perspective has gone through a sea change when developers came up with properties in the region that redefined NCRâs luxury real estate market. When the global pandemic struck, the Indian real estate sector took its brunt, and many predicted a protracted period of hardship, particularly in the luxury sector. However, things changed as people became more interested in luxury because of the healthy lifestyle it promised. This year, the definition of luxury evolved from pricy furnishings to a full way of life. (By Deepak Kapoor, Director, Gulshan Group)  Investor confidence in real estate has risen; branded developers dominate the new housing supply, and buyers consider them safe bets.[https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/luxury-housing1.jpg]"
411,0,Sheraton getting a new owner,580 words,The Boston Globe,"Investment firms VÃ¤rde Capital and Hawkins Way Capital closed this week on a $233 million deal to buy the Sheraton Boston on Dalton Street in Back Bay. The 1,220-room hotel had been owned by Host Hotels & Resorts, which put it up for sale last summer, shortly after the property reopened following a lengthy pandemic shutdown. At roughly $191,000 per room, the sale price is far below the value of major hotels sold in Boston before the COVID-19 pandemic clobbered business travel and convention business, and is even significantly lower than some hotel deals that have taken place in the city since. The downtown Boston hotel industry has been particularly hard-hit in the pandemic, with occupancy rates running at just 45 percent in 2021 and revenue per room ï¿½?a key industry stat ï¿½?averaging just $95 per night, less than half what it was in 2019, according to data from hotel consulting firm Pinnacle Advisory Group. The Sheraton, a 29-story tower next to the Hynes Convention Center and Prudential Center, has been affected more than most. It was closed from March 2020, when COVID-19 essentially shut down Boston, until it reopened on Aug. 1, 2021. Since then, conventions at the Hynes have been scarce, and business travel slow to resume. Today, Northeastern University leases a block of rooms for student housing. It's not clear what VÃ¤rde and Hawkins may have planned for the complex. As part of the deal, the buyers are taking out a $163 million âbridge loan"" from Host Hotels, which had planned renovations before deciding to put the hotel on the market. In a statement, the new owners raised the possibility of âalternative"" uses ï¿½?either hospitality or housing ï¿½?which could signal a shift from the traditional large convention center-oriented hotel the Sheraton has long been. âWe will continue to leverage our hospitality, multifamily and student housing expertise to refresh and/or reposition assets such as the Sheraton Boston Hotel in order to seek to maximize value,"" said Hawkins Way managing partner Ross Walker. The hotel has a long-term relationship with Sheraton, making a shift entirely away from hotel use unlikely. And in a follow-up e-mail, Walker said he was speaking in general terms about plans for the Sheraton Boston. âWe do not have any new ideas to discuss at this time,"" Walker wrote. Still, some alternative use, at least for part of the massive property, may be worth considering, said Sebastian Colella, a vice president at Pinnacle. âWith the impacts of the pandemic, new hotel supply in recent years, and rising operating costs, hotel owners and investors are evaluating the highest and best use of these properties,"" he said. âIt would make perfect sense for a new buyer of a hotel this size to consider downsizing the room count."" Hawkins Way also owns the Copley Square Hotel, on Huntington Avenue, which has been closed for renovations since the original pandemic shutdown. Walker said work is complete and the hotel is now âready to open,"" pending final city permits. Tim Logan can be reached at timothy.logan@globe.com. Follow him on Twitter at @bytimlogan.

663,1,Press Release: GridX Announces $40 Million in Series C Funding and Appoints New CEO,1083 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"MILPITAS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 14, 2022-- GridX, the leading enterprise rate platform provider to modern utilities and energy technology companies, today announced it has closed $40 million in Series C funding led by Energy Impact Partners (EIP), a global investment platform leading the transition to a sustainable energy future. Moore Strategic Ventures (MSV), Sunfox Capital and NGP ETP also participated in the round with Hunter Horgan of MSV joining the company's board of directors. GridX also announced that Chris Black has been appointed CEO of GridX. Both moves aim to speed the clean energy transition by accelerating the development of GridX's leading rate analytics and complex billing solutions, and building out its sales and marketing, product, and engineering teams. ""Following our initial investment in GridX in 2021, the imperative to eliminate carbon from our economy has grown leaps and bounds,"" said Lindsay Luger, Co-Founder & Partner, Energy Impact Partners. ""While solutions to this generational challenge are still emerging, one thing is certain -- electrification, adoption of distributed energy resources and increasingly complex rate structures demand the type of advanced analytics solutions provided by GridX."" The energy industry is undergoing the largest transition since the advent of electricity. Utilities around the world have committed to dramatically reducing or eliminating carbon from our economy over the next 30 years. Critical to that effort is electrifying transportation and heating, increasing the adoption of distributed energy resources like smart thermostats, solar, and storage, and helping customers shift their usage to times of the day when energy is most sustainable. GridX sits at the intersection of these trends with analytics solutions that manage the deployment of increasingly complex rate structures. From helping utilities design and implement new rates, to matching customers with those optimized for them, and accurately calculating the impact of energy-related actions on bills, GridX empowers energy suppliers to swiftly deploy new business models. Today, GridX works with some of the most innovative utilities and retail energy suppliers across North America, including Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, PSEG Long Island, and Consumers Energy, to serve more than 19 million homes and businesses. ""I can't think of a more exciting industry to be in as energy professionals are literally reinventing the way we power our daily lives, "" said Chris Black, CEO, GridX. ""But with these innovations come increased complexity from the exponential growth in distributed energy resources like solar and electric vehicles. Unfortunately, this complexity is most often felt by energy consumers because we've struggled to translate the impact of these technologies into dollars and cents so people know exactly what they can expect to pay. Communicating energy impact is easy but conveying the bill impact is incredibly hard. GridX is unique in its ability to do exactly this for anyone with an energy value proposition to homes and businesses."" Chris brings nearly 30 years of technology and operational expertise to GridX, most recently serving as a principal partner at Huck Capital, an investment firm at the forefront of building the next generation of sustainable, tech-enabled energy providers. Prior to that, he was CTO and COO at Tendril, an early pioneer and eventual leader in the home energy management space. While at Tendril, Chris was instrumental in executing an aggressive strategy to acquire the leading companies in the space to form a new entity. That company -- Uplight -- is now the industry's leading technology partner for providers transitioning to the clean energy ecosystem. About GridX, Inc. GridX, Inc. partners with utilities and energy suppliers to transform their businesses and accelerate the clean energy transition. The company's Enterprise Rate Platform helps these organizations to develop new products and business models to achieve their clean energy goals; quickly operationalize new offerings in their billing and settlement processes; and better engage with their customers for broader program adoption.

It cited a former head of Kazakhstan's security services as a source of this information,"" the security committee's press service said in quotes from a statement posted on the Vecherniy Bishkek newspaper's website on 4 March. It noted that these ""actions lead to misinformation and mislead the Kyrgyz people and other countries, as well as act as a catalyst for the spreading of ethnic strife and the formation of hostility along ethnic lines"".

NEXT TV is an independent television channel with focus on news, discussions, including the Russian war in Ukraine, politics, culture and entertainment. The output includes live broadcasts. The channel is linked to a well-known pro-Western opposition figure, Ravshan Jeenbekov.

806,1,AppTek Launches New Metadata-Informed Neural Machine Translation System for Enterprises; Expands MT Language and Dialect Coverage,986 words,PR Newswire,"AppTek's new meta-aware NMT system is changing the paradigm of how professional translators work with machine translation output. Up until today, most off-the-shelf MT systems have functioned inside a ""black box"" where source language text is formulated into text of a target language with no or limited awareness of the surrounding context or the domain or topic of the source text, and with limited control of the resulting output. Traditionally, enterprises would need to train, deploy and maintain multiple MT systems to account for translation tasks that differ in aspects such as language, dialect, domain, topic, and more, at the risk of high deployment costs and overfitting models. With AppTek's new metadata informed NMT platform, enterprise customers can now access a single NMT system with multi-domain, multi-genre, multi-dialect content which increases the quality and adaptability of the system. By feeding additional metadata into the system, they gain more control of the MT output and can enable translators to simply ""flip the switch"" to the desired customized translation through relevant functionality in the user interface of the editing tools professionals work with. Examples of MT output customization achieved with using additional metadata include: -- Style - switch between formal and informal styles, such as that between a telenovela and a documentary, and get a translation with an appropriate politeness register depending on speaker status and relationships; -- Length Control for Automatic Dubbing and Subtitling Tasks -- generate shorter or longer translations with minimal information loss or distortion for tasks with hard length constraints; -- Speaker Gender -- toggle to the correct speaker gender, which influences inflections for certain parts of speech, especially in morphologically rich languages such as Czech; -- Domain -- adapt to the genre of the text, such as news programs, patents, talk shows, etc. to increase overall accuracy and use of in-domain, relevant translations of ambiguous words at the document level; -- Extended Context -- optionally make the system consider neighboring sentences within a document when translating a particular sentence so that ambiguity of, for example, pronoun translation can be resolved. -- Glossary -- account for official or mandatory translations which the system may otherwise translate differently; and, -- Language Variety - account for multiple languages and dialects within a single system, as well as handling mixed-language content. ""By incorporating metadata to influence the MT output we are able to inject some 'world knowledge' into our platform,"" said Evgeny Matusov, AppTek's Lead Science Architect for Neural Machine Translation. ""This improves the overall quality and adaptability of the system output and can be accomplished within a single multi-purpose system designed to reduce environmental footprint and cost."" AppTek's metadata-informed MT technology is now available for translation from English to selected European languages and their varieties, with more language pairs coming soon. The system can be customized and adapted to the needs of enterprise customers by utilizing existing parallel domain-specific translation corpora found inside company archives. ""As the demand for content localization continues to skyrocket, enterprises need to continue to innovate and find new ways to further accelerate production workflows,"" said Kyle Maddock, SVP Marketing at AppTek. ""Our metadata-informed MT system has been specifically designed with translation professionals in mind, by providing them with more control over the MT output which can further speed up the localization process."" In addition to its metadata-informed NMT system, AppTek has also expanded its core MT platform to cover an extensive list of languages and dialects including the addition of Indic and Slavic languages. It now supports Afrikaans, Albanian, Amharic, Arabic (multi-dialect), Armenian, Azerbaijani, Bengali, Belorussian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (multi-dialect), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dari, Dutch, English (multi-dialect), Estonian, Farsi, Finnish, French (multi-dialect), Georgian, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hausa, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Kazakh, Korean, Kyrgyz, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Malay, Malayalam, Marathi, Mongolian, Norwegian, Pashto, Polish, Portuguese (multi-dialect), Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Somali, Spanish (multi-dialect), Swedish, Tagalog, Tamil, Telugu, Tigrinya, Thai, Turkish, Turkmen, Ukrainian, Urdu and Uzbek.

452,0,"As Olympic torch is lit in hope, I see light at end of the tunnel",790 words,Evening Times,"When Ivy League universities in America are closing their doors and sending students home until August, donât rule out the first cancellation of an Olympic Games since World War II.? The IOC and host nation Japan are still confident that the Games will go ahead as planned, but no one has any real idea on how long this might go on for. Just from athletes I have spoken to, there is definitely real concern over the Games. The concern isnât just over whether the games get cancelled or not. For each individual athlete, it is also over their own preparations. As an athlete, getting sick is never great and if you got this virus bad you might face missing weeks of training. It could result on you missing the podium in Tokyo.? Or missing the Games altogether. Another friend of mine told me of his concerns that if they move the Games then he might not even get selected.? With markets crashing and supermarket shelves being cleared, these are definitely interesting times for everybody. But when you are living during this Covid-19 pandemic with a spinal-cord injury I guess it becomes even more daunting ï¿½?as such an injury can remove your cough and sneeze reflex. With very little core function, the thought of not being able to cough is a pretty scary proposition.? This might not sound too bad. But this virus hits elderly people hard ï¿½?and this also includes your biological age due to underlying medical conditions. So this is a scary time, and I completely feel for everyone in the same boat as me how scary this is.?I remember back to catching the flu in November last year ï¿½?I thought I was going to stop breathing. I couldnât cough to clear my lungs as the level of my injury is right at the nerves which go to the lungs.? It knocked me out for weeks, so I would be lying if I said I wasnât slightly scared of Covid-19 and its possible effects on my lungs.? I am a very optimistic person who always looks for solutions over problems. But I must admit this has got me a little bit shaken.? Watching whatâs happening in Italy has been hard to believe ï¿½?particularly as life seemed to be continuing almost as normal here.? I looked at the MRI of a 44-year-old manâs lungs and it was unbelievable, unfortunately he didnât survive.? So I am staying positive but also taking advice from Austrian neurologist Viktor Frankl.?He speaks of acceptance of your current situation. These are his own words ï¿½?which I have had on my wall for the last four years: âThe meaning of life lies in finding a purpose and taking responsibility for ourselves and other human beings.ï¿½? In other words, by having a clear âwhyï¿½?we can face all the âhowï¿½?questions of life. This has got me through all those hours in hospital and continues to serve me daily.? Thereâs a reason that in-flight safety presentations always instruct us to secure our own oxygen masks before assisting fellow passengers. We canât help others effectively unless we first protect ourselves. So I spoke with a medical oncologist friend and they advised me to self-isolate.? I am now on day four and thinking this could be a long road ahead; thankfully the weather is getting warmer and I got out on my bike for a few laps of Richmond Park. Along with indoor turbo sessions I am well prepared mentally for the process. I guess all my time in hospital equipped my mind to deal with self-isolating. It also probably helps being an introvert.? I canât help but think of the poor people undergoing their cancer treatment right now though, as I prepare for my own hospital appointment in a few weeks, but I am grateful that side of things is under control. My main goal is keeping my immune system strong because another issue I have from my spinal-cord injury is a compromised immune system, thus moving me into a vulnerable group.? Itâs hard to go from a strong athlete to now feeling so vulnerable, but thankfully I have a strong mind."
60,0,Young flock to join Russia's brain drain as economy tanks,1062 words,The Daily Telegraph,"Friends of the Moscow translator in his late 20s have already left for Turkey, Georgia and Armenia, while many others ""are thinking about leaving"" as the Russian economy tanks. ""There's basically no way left to get a good income unless you're into corruption, connections or straightout crime,"" he says. ""There's rumours of Russia being disconnected off the internet. If that happens, I'm done with this country. I don't want to live in a bigger North Korea."" Not only is Russia's economy crumbling under Western sanctions and corporate boycotts from the likes of Coca-Cola and Zara, but a crippling ""brain drain"" is set to starve it of growth, workers and entrepreneurs. Many young Russians have already left or are thinking about escaping as the Russian economy heads for a deep recession that threatens to trash their job prospects. Moscow is on the cusp of its first default on international debts since the Bolshevik revolution after last week failing to pay $117m (Â£89m) owed to creditors, triggering a 30-day grace period. Officials in Georgia - which itself was invaded by Putin in 2008 - say that 20,000 to 25,000 Russians have already crossed the border while others are reported to have flooded into Finland, Armenia and Kazakhstan. Armenia estimated last week that 6,000 from Russia and Ukraine are arriving every day. Many of those fleeing have caught wind of rumours the Kremlin will install strict martial law to contain unrest on Russian streets and close the borders to stop an exodus. Citizens are already banned from leaving with more than $10,000 in foreign currency. Young Russians speaking to The Daily Telegraph reveal fears of an economy in freefall, a looming crackdown on civil liberties and a return to the darkest days of the Soviet Union. Igor, a 30-year-old who works in software, says: ""I don't think I have a single friend who is not planning to move There is a very noticeable feeling of impending doom in conversations and on social media. It's like all hope has been snuffed out."" He adds: ""The economy is collapsing. I lived through the 1990s as a child and I don't want to repeat that,"" he says, adding that he wants to move to London as it is a tech hub and a diverse city ""where my family will not feel like total outsiders"". Losing young workers, particularly your most talented and educated, typically lowers growth, reduces tax revenue, creates staff shortages and rids economies of wealth-creating entrepreneurs. An IMF study found that cumulative GDP growth in Eastern Europe would have been seven percentage points higher in real terms between 1995 and 2012 if the region had not suffered high levels of emigration. Madina Khrustaleva, Russia analyst at TS Lombard, says the brain drain will likely reach levels hit in the 1990s when a floundering Russian economy suffered an exodus. She estimates that 500,000 ""highly qualified professionals have left since 2014"" when the economy struggled, including herself. ""The Government is trying to help IT companies and to prevent youngsters from leaving the country. But that's going to be almost impossible, taking into account what the economy will be able to offer them in the next 10 years If you are able to leave, you will leave."" Russia's labour market is already battling high youth unemployment and a declining population. The latest World Bank data, from 2020, suggests 17pc unemployment for 15 to 24-yearolds, far higher than the overall figures - currently at just above 4pc. Liam Peach, an economist at Capital Economics, says immigrants arriving mostly from post-Soviet states ""offset some of the natural fall in the population"" in recent years. ""But Russia may find it harder to attract migrants now, while emigration out of Russia may rise. Russia therefore faces a nasty combination of continued weak productivity growth and slow growth of the workforce,"" he adds. Even before the war, many young Russians were considering leaving. Moscow's economy has been stuck in stagnation for much of the last eight years following the 2014 oil price crash and sanctions from the Crimea annexation. Last year 48pc of those aged between 18 and 24 said they would like to move abroad permanently, compared to a fifth of all Russians, according to a survey by the independent Levada Centre. It found a tenth of Russians were taking some steps towards leaving. The recent invasion of Ukraine appears to have been the final straw for young talent worried about a return to the Soviet era of scarcity and brutal authoritarianism - in stark contrast to the comparative freedom and capitalism they have grown up with. Anna Golikova, a 22-year-old who moved to Denmark from Russia earlier this month, says: ""Some people compare this situation to the Soviet Union and how it was back then. ""[Many of us] were born after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. For us we never lived in that reality and it's very scary that we are going back to these times."" Anna, who has set up an organisation called Speak Up For Peace that teaches Ukrainian refugees new languages, says younger generations ""don't see any future"" in Russia and warns the ""consequences will be long term and really affect young people."" As the economic outlook deteriorates and the exodus of companies gathers pace, many will hope to follow Luka, who fled to Greece via Uzbekistan and Turkey after fearing that ""martial law and mass mobilisation"" of Russians to fight are ""only a matter of time"". The Moscow entrepreneur in his mid-20s says his friends are now split between ""those who are left and those who cannot"". ""I know for sure that if I come back, it will be only when the government radically changes."" Names of interviewees have been changed in order to protect their identity"

890,0,Explained: What is Facebook Protect and why is it important,598 words,The Times of India,"Facebook sends notifications to enable the Facebook Protect feature when you open the app. It does not ask for any account details and only asks you to turn on 2FA (if not done already) along with enabling Facebook Protect.How to get Facebook Protect?This feature has recently been introduced in India and it might take some time before most people find the notification to enable it. Facebook is soon going to have a process that will allow users to register if they donât get the notification. The company has revealed that there is a combination of multiple factors that decides the list of accounts that are at risk. The network depends on experts around the world who can identify prominent critical voices. Currently, there are no ways for accounts to get the Facebook Protect feature if it doesnât belong to a journalist, a human rights defender or an activist. The company has not revealed if Facebook Protect will be rolled out to other accounts. Although, the 2FA feature can be used by anyone to increase overall security. What makes it an important security feature?Facebook states that this feature remains underutilised as only 4 per cent of all users on the messaging platform have 2FA turned on. 2FA is a security feature that allows access to a particular Facebook account from a new device only with a login code. These login codes come either via SMS or from a third-party authenticator app such as Google Authenticator. The 2FA feature can be an important defence mechanism for all accounts.

648,1,Roundup: Chinese-invested enterprises in South Africa hold job fair to pursue localized development,640 words,Xinhua News Agency,"Chinese Ambassador Chen Xiaodong said the job Fair is a concrete initiative and effort to implement agreements between the leaders of the two countries. It not only creates jobs for South Africans but also provides an opportunity for Chinese enterprises to hire local talent and pursue localized development. ""Today, over 100 Chinese-invested enterprises pledge to provide 20,000 jobs directly for South Africans in the next three years. Their businesses cover infrastructure, communications, mining, automobile, agriculture and many other areas,"" said Chen. ""For example, Huawei will provide 450 jobs and Pengxin will provide 3,500 jobs in the next three years."" South Africa's Deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Alvin Botes said the job fair showed China's commitment to eradicating the triple challenges of poverty, unemployment, and inequality and was evidence of the depth of the two countries' partnership. According to him, the job fair would not only generate much-needed jobs, but also lead to skills transfer, especially in ICT, mining clothing, information technology, and construction. ""I believe that the Chinese companies and enterprises participating in this event have already advertised job opportunities and I hope that many young South Africans would embrace these opportunities that are being offered by the Chinese business community,"" he said. Botes said there were more than 200 Chinese enterprises in South Africa in different sectors including finance, mining, home appliances, communications, and construction machinery. Chinese-invested enterprises contribute to sustainable development in South Africa as the country was one of the largest investment destinations for Chinese companies in Africa. ""China's investment in South Africa exceeded 25 billion U.S. dollars in cumulative terms,"" Botes said. ""While this Jobs Fair and the opportunities on offer should be seen as complementary to the South Africa-China strategic partnership, it could be viewed as a further opportunity to enrich the bonds of friendship and understanding that exist between our people, as well as our cultures."" South Africa's Minister of Employment and Labor Thulas Nxesi expressed his gratitude to the Chinese Embassy and Chinese businesses for hosting the Job Fair 2022 of Chinese-Invested Enterprises, which, he said, would contribute significantly to reducing unemployment in the country. ""The Jobs Fair is a milestone in our friendship that is built on trust and mutual respect. As very good friends, the Chinese government and companies are aware that the issue of employment creation is at the center of our government's programs and priorities,"" Nxesi said at the Job Fair. According to Nxesi, the unemployment rate of South Africa stands at 35.3 percent for now. This ratio is much higher when it comes to the young people that are not economically engaged. ""On behalf of our government, I wish to express our gratitude to the people of China for this important gesture which will undoubtedly contribute to our efforts to reduce the current 35.3 percent unemployment rate,"" he said while calling on Chinese companies to partner with South African companies to create jobs in the country. ""These collaborations will ensure that these companies get a chance to scale up to compete globally,"" Nxesi said. ""Moreover, we will improve our cooperation at the level of BRICS and other platforms to build labor markets that are resilient and responsive to the needs of our citizens."" Enditem"

Eleven types of facilities, including restaurants, cafes, karaokes and public baths, where vaccine pass is still required, mandate visitors to show data proving that they are fully vaccinated. Aside from the frequently used QR code check-in, visitors can use COOV app on their smartphone or a paper certificate. Some point out that the government's new guidelines do not satisfy both small business owners and the medical community. The government initially planned to raise the private gathering size to eight but decided not to as the country's daily COVID-19 cases surpassed 100,000 recently, and just extended the mandatory closing time. Health experts are concerned that the government's decision may encourage people to let their guard down against COVID-19 and exacerbate the COVID-19 crisis.

980,1,IFCJ contributed in almost 50% increase in food baskets for Passover,766 words,Jpost.com (The Jerusalem Post online edition),"Twice a year, around the holiday seasons, the soup kitchens provide assistance through dedicated holiday baskets. As a result, food kitchens are forced to increase resources in favor of increasing the number of daily rations and distributing the food baskets designated for Passover. The grant for Passover, on behalf of the IFCJ, is intended to help increase resources, prevent the use of the annual budget of the food kitchens and prevent a significant impact on their activities. This year's grant is larger than that given to the food kitchens last year, which stood at about 350,000 ILS. For example, in ""Lasova"" in Tel Aviv, 1,000 food baskets are distributed this year, compared to only 50 last year, and 4,000 cooked meals are distributed compared to 2,400 last year. At the ""Mercaz HaChesed"" in Sderot, 1,200 food baskets are distributed this year, double the amount distributed at Passover last year. At ""Beâer-Sova"", located in Be'er Sheva, 500 food baskets are distributed, compared to only 65 last year, and 1,800 cooked meals are distributed, compared to only 200 last year. At ""Beit Batya"" in Kiryat Shmona, 500 cooked meals are distributed compared to 180 meals last year, along with 400 food baskets, 100 more baskets compared to Passover last year. The aid grant for the soup kitchens joins a special aid campaign for Passover held by the IFCJ, which focuses on basic needs, with an emphasis on food aid. Thanks to the mobilization of many Israeli-loving donors, the operating budget is about 18 million ILS and will provide assistance to about 50,000 families, the elderly, welfare children, lone soldiers and the needy. As part of the campaign, which will last until the end of February, the IFCJ provides: IFCJ contributed in almost 50% increase in food baskets for Passover. (credit: IFCJ, ISRAEL YOSEF) The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, together with the Ministry of Welfare and Social Security, is also setting a budget of 8 million ILS to expand the ""Golden Shield"" program operated by the ministry. The additional budget will be allocated to assist the elderly and Holocaust survivors in providing basic needs. The assistance activity will be carried out in collaboration with the IFCJ, through the social services departments in the local authorities. Senior citizens receiving service in social services departments and those who were in severe distress in light of the economic crisis during the COVID-19 period will now receive assistance in purchasing food products up to 2,200 ILS per household through regular packages, food chain tickets, shopping vouchers for local shops or chilled meals. In addition, the IFCJ provided 2.5 million USD in aid for Passover to Jewish communities in Ukraine. Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, the Fellowship has constantly assisted in evacuating Jews from their homes, providing food, medicine, necessary equipment, establishing a support assistance line and more. The Emergency Program of the IFCJ to the Jewish communities in Ukraine has so far included emergency grants totaling 4 million USD to a number of organizations working in the field. Now with the aid grant for Passover, the cumulative amount of grants has increased to 6.5 million USD. IFCJ contributed in almost 50% increase in food baskets for Passover. (credit: IFCJ, ISRAEL YOSEF) Ahead of Passover, the IFCJ, in collaboration with Chabad[https://www-jpost-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/j-spot/article-704109], distributed 10 tons of matzah to the Jewish community in Odessa. The shipment, which was planned even before the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, arrived at the port of Odessa and its release was delayed due to the state of emergency at the port which approved the unloading and release of goods according to their degree of necessity for the war. After much effort on the part of the IFCJ and Chabad, the matzah delivery was released from the port and its distribution among the Jewish community began."

This time it plans to use the stock symbol STWY, a departure from last time around when it used LVB as a tribute to Ludwig van Beethoven. A spokeswoman for Steinway declined to give a date for the initial public offering or say how much money it plans to raise. Proceeds of the IPO will go to Mr. Paulson, his firm and other stakeholders, according to the filing. A spokesman for Paulson & Co. didn't comment. A Steinway grand piano costs between $60,000 and $340,000, according to the filing. A smaller, upright piano starts at $40,000. The company also sells brass and woodwind instruments through its Conn-Selmer line. The Spirio, a self-playing piano, is its priciest model, making up about 32% of its total piano sales last year, the filing said. The Spirio appeals to those who don't know how to play but still want to hear one playing in their house, according to the company.  Steinway reported revenue of $538 million in 2021, up 29% from the year before, according to the filing. Net income rose 14% to $59 million in the same period. The company's filing said it wants to sell more pianos in China, where it says sales of luxury goods are growing and more children are learning to play the piano than in other parts of the world. It opened a Beijing store in 2017. ""China represents a unique market for Steinway due to two primary cultural and structural factors,"" the filing said. ""A deep-rooted reverence for classical music, specifically piano music, and a sizeable and rapidly expanding middle and upper class with an appetite for luxury Western products."" Steinway was founded in 1853 by Henry Engelhard Steinway, a German immigrant who developed the first Steinway piano in a Manhattan loft. A factory was opened in Astoria, a neighborhood in New York City's Queens borough, in 1873. A second one was opened in Hamburg, Germany, seven years later. Pianos are still made in both cities, said the company, which has its headquarters in Astoria. Steinway Street, a busy Astoria street, is named after it.

61,1,Digitization primed lender for growth Low-risk exposure paid off in pandemic,581 words,The Toronto Star,"Maria-Gabriella Khoury, senior vice-president of North American financial institutions at credit ratings agency DBRS Morningstar, said Home Capital's customer base includes many self-employed, new immigrant or otherwise alternative borrowers, a market she predicts will only grow in the coming months and years. After a near-death experience in 2017, the firm has returned to its pre-crisis footing, said Khoury, and the changes they've made with regards to digitization primed them for the pandemic shift. DBRS Morningstar's latest rating report on the firm was positive, noting a successful implementation of its strategic plan launched in 2019, including investments in technology. The report says these strategies have helped Home Capital regain its position as market leader. Because Home Capital already offers higher-priced products than institutions that deal primarily in prime rates, the firm has some flexibility in adjusting to rate hikes that other firms might not have, said Khoury.  Home Capital's stock price has been trending downwards, hovering in the mid- to high 30s in 2022 down from more than $45 in November 2021. But it's still higher than it was a year ago, at just over $30 in April 2021. Khoury said both Home Capital and First National have performed well since lockdowns began to ease last year, despite market volatility.  Home Capital has less competition than First National, one of the largest non-bank mortgage finance companies, according to DBRS Morningstar, which is primarily competing with other institutions offering prime rates. First National's customer base is also narrower, said Khoury, as it mainly deals directly with the mortgage brokers, while Home Capital deals with brokers, borrowers, depositors and others.  First National does have some alternative lending products but they're not the company's bread and butter, unlike Home Capital, said Khoury. That makes them very different institutions, she said: ""The client profile is very different."" Because of these differences, however, First National is generally exposed to less risk than Home Capital. During the pandemic, this paid off - its 2021 financial report shows that despite the volatility of the pandemic, the firm benefited from its business model. In 2021, the firm's mortgages under administration - the source of most of its earnings - reached a record high, and in its year-end report, the firm appears optimistic that it will continue to benefit from this growth into 2022 even if the housing market slows down.  First National's stock price has been trending downwards in the past several months, with a steep drop from the mid-40s to the high 30s in early March. Hoovering at around $40 this week, it's down by about $8 from a year ago. The bottom line Both Home Capital and First National are targeting urban areas, which are seeing lots of traffic, said Khoury - but both also have to contend with stress tests and the rising rates. The rate hike means alternative lending products may play a bigger role for homeowners and homebuyers in the near future, said Khoury. Home Capital's customer base and flexibility, combined with its clear digital mindset, may give it the upper hand in the coming months."

Aided by acquisitions and organic growth, the company posted an annual sales volume growth of 20 per cent from 279 million unit cases in 2017 to 569 million unit cases in 2021. The companyâs product and capacity expansion could act as growth triggers.

New plants in Bihar and Jammu & Kashmir will help bring its products closer to customers, increase penetration, help gain market share and improve profitability. While revenue growth is expected to be strong , the company will face commodity headwinds. Most brokerages expect an operating profit margin impact of over 120 basis points y-o-y in Q4FY22 to 15.9 per cent. The company, according to Kotak Institutional Equities, is facing inflationary pressure in PET chips, partly mitigated by low-cost inventory, operating leverage, and other cost saving initiatives such as light-weighting PET preforms. Expansion in international geographies such as Congo, higher overseas contribution to overall revenues and net profits as well as reduction of debt are expected to support the stock. Motilal Oswal Research expects the company to generate a free cash flow of Rs 2,670 crore over CY22-23 with overall debt expected to come down to Rs 990 crore in CY23 from Rs 3,340 crore in CY21. At the current price, the stock, which hit its 52-week highs on Wednesday, is trading at 36 times its CY23 earnings estimates. While growth prospects are strong, the stock (12 per cent higher over the past month) is trading near the target prices of most brokerages.

If they do not have a full course of vaccination, teenagers will need a professionally taken negative antigen every 24 hours to activate their pass ï¿½?tests are available to take in resorts, costing roughly ï¿½?2 for an antigen test or ï¿½?4 for a PCR. Pharmacies in some resorts are also able to issue a pass sanitaire (roughly ï¿½?6), valid for the duration of your stay, to single-jabbed teens who have recovered Covid-19 in the last six months and may struggle to get a âcertificate of recoveryï¿½?in the UK[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/news/forced-quarantine-freezing-motorhome-mercy-french-police/] and want to avoid the cost of testing daily. The option to take a test to access public places has been removed for anyone over the age of 16 with the introduction of the pass vaccinal. Italy Entry requirements Italy's borders are open to British holidaymakers, and vaccinated visitors, or those with proof of recovery, do not need to quarantine. Those who haven't had both jabs do still have to quarantine for five days, at the end of which they must take a test. Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, must present a negative test taken in the 48 hours before entering Italy and complete the EUâs digital passenger locator form, via the EU PLF application.

Following a winter of strict lockdowns and shuttered ski lifts, resorts in Italy have reopened and are welcoming Britons[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/news/slopes-italy-british-skiers-still-welcome/]. What rules are in place? Italy tightened its Covid-19 restrictions on January 10. Its 'Super Green Pass' rule ï¿½?the requirement for proof of vaccination or recovery (a negative PCR test result is not sufficient) ï¿½?has been extended to a range of venues and locations, including hotels, ski lifts and ski resorts. The pass first came into force on December 6 and since then was already required for anyone over the ages of 12 to buy ski lift tickets, with passes scanned at the base of the gondola, as well as to access restaurants and bars. Skiers are recommended to purchase lift passes online in advance to avoid queues and retain their lift pass card to use if visiting multiple times. As a general rule, lifts will operate at 80 per cent capacity ï¿½?Covid marshalls are on hand to ensure people are complying with rules. Here's what it's like to be back on the slopes this season.[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/news/slopes-italy-british-skiers-still-welcome/] What are the rules for families and teenagers? Only children aged 5 and under are exempt from pre-arrival testing. Under-18s do not need to quarantine if they are travelling with a fully vaccinated parent and (for those over the age of 6) have a negative test. However, the 'Super Green Pass' rules will affect family ski holidays if over-12s aren't double jabbed. A full course of vaccination is required to teenagers wanting to access ski lifts, hotels or restaurants ï¿½?or proof of recovery (within the previous 180 days). Vaccine-ineligible children under 12 have to prove their age to access key services. More information regarding the pass can be found here[https://italygreenpass.com/faq/]. Canada Entry requirements Fully vaccinated travellers are welcome in Canada, however they must present proof of this plus a negative result of molecular test result taken no more than 72 hours before their scheduled flight. This information must be submitted via the ArriveCAN app before arrival, along with an electronic travel authorisation (eTA) form. They may also be chosen to test on arrival to Canada, and must isolate at their chosen place of quarantine until the result is received. Unvaccinated Britons are not eligible to enter Canada. See below rules for children. Are ski resorts open? Yes, the ski lifts in Banff[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/resort-guides/canada/banff/banff-ski-holiday-guide/] and Lake Louise have begun turning and skiers are back in Whistler. What rules are in place? Canadaâs resorts have been welcoming domestic visitors throughout the summer season and last winter, and are well versed in operating in the current climate, but rules vary greatly between resorts. In Whistler[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/resort-guides/canada/whistler/whistler-ski-holiday-guide/], the countryâs largest and most popular resort, a number of measures have been announced by owners Vail Resorts to curb the spread of the virus this winter. These include mandatory mask wearing when indoors, including on enclosed lifts, cashless transactions in shops and restaurants. Whistler Blackcomb requires proof of Covid-19 vaccinations in all indoor restaurants, restaurant patios and bars due to orders from the Provincial Health Authority of British Columbia and all Vail Resorts employees will be required to be vaccinated against Covid-19. Anyone wanting to eat at self-service restaurants on the mountain will need to make a mandatory reservation. Last winter the resort also adopted a reservation system for lift passes, requiring skiers to pre-book their place on the mountain each day ï¿½?this has been scrapped for 2021/22 and lifts will run at their normal capacity. Elsewhere in British Columbia, Grouse Mountain and Revelstoke have both mandated that skiers prove theyâre vaccinated before visiting. Lake Louise in Alberta has implemented what is known as a 'Restrictions Exemption Program,' meaning skiers have to have proof of vaccination, a negative test or recovery to access most resort services. Here's what it is like to be back on the slopes in Canada.[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/news/really-like-ski-canada-season/] What are the rules for families and teenagers? Children over 12 must be fully vaccinated in order to visit Canada ï¿½?and any unvaccinated children aged 5-11 years in Canada must have proof of recovery from Covid between 14 and 180 days before departure. The US Entry requirements Fully vaccinated Britons, as well as unvaccinated under 18s, can travel to the US, with proof of a negative test, but not those who are unvaccinated. Find more information here[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/advice/travel-to-usa-when-uk-ban-lift-entry-requirements-america/]. See below rules for children. Are ski resorts open? Yes, with rules in place, which vary across state borders. What rules are in place? Itâs a complicated situation in America, with varying rules from state to state. As a guide, a number of ski resorts are owned and operated by giant Vail Resorts, which implemented blanket restrictions across its destinations[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/news/ski-resorts-in-america-announce-strict-rules-for-this-winter/], regardless of state rulings, last winter. This season the mandatory lift pass reservation system has been scrapped, but masks remain commonplace and visitors aged 12 and over will be required to show proof of vaccination when eating at on-mountain self-service restaurants and all Vail Resorts employees will be required to be vaccinated against Covid-19. Ski school will also require proof of vaccination for full-day lessons. Elsewhere, at Aspen and Snowmass for example, similar rules apply, requiring vaccination to access restaurants and hotels, but not the slopes. What are the rules for families and teenagers? Unvaccinated children and teenagers aged 17 and under can ski unrestricted in many destinations in the USA, but if unvaccinated, those kids must take an antigen test between days three and five of their holiday once in resort. Rules vary for youngsters between states, but in some destinations owned by giant Vail Resorts, guests aged 12 and over are required to show proof of vaccination to dine at indoor, on-mountain self-service restaurants ï¿½?if over 12s want to ski and dine with a ski school on a full-day lesson they will therefore need to be double jabbed ï¿½?but the inoculation rules stop there. Norway Entry requirements Britons with a valid QR coded NHS Covid Pass can visit Norway, but must complete an online registration form, within 72 hours prior to arrival ï¿½?the need to carry out mandatory testing on arrival has been dropped[https://www.facebook.com/homeofskiing/posts/5067963543255022]. Unvaccinated travellers and persons who received their first vaccine dose between three and 15 weeks prior to their date of arrival must quarantine. The UK is currently classified as 'dark red', meaning unvaccinated arrivals must quarantine for ten days with the option to leave quarantine if they test negative on a PCR test after day three. See below rules for children. Are ski resorts open? Yes, including Trysil, Hemsedal and Myrkdalen. What rules are in place? Unlike their Alpine cousins Norwayâs resorts have not made masks mandatory for visitors this winter. Instead visitors are encouraged to observe social distancing, stay at home if they feel unwell and make reservations in advance to avoid queues. It's one of a small handful of hassle-free ski holiday destinations[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/advice/go-normal-ski-holiday-without-red-tape/] this winter. What are the rules for families and teenagers? Unvaccinated teenagers are allowed to travel with their parents without the need to quarantine. Travellers under the age of 16 are exempt from completing an online registration form[https://reg.entrynorway.no/], within 72 hours prior to arrival. All over-12s must wear a face covering in public areas where it is not possible to socially distance, but there are very few restrictions on skiing. What do I need to know before I book the best ski holiday destinations for the 2021/22 season? It is essential you check the latest travel advice for a destination before booking. Whether you leave it until the last minute or book now to secure your spot on the slopes, as long as you book with an Atol-bonded tour operator, or ï¿½?in most cases ï¿½?pay for your holiday with a credit card, you will get a refund in the event of the operator going into insolvency. Package holiday providers also have a legal responsibility for your safety, so they wonât take you to a destination that the FCDO advises against, or if resorts are closed because of lockdown measures, and they are legally obliged to refund you for a cancellation ï¿½?though many have been taking weeks or months to do so. Many travel insurance companies have now started to sell policies again and nearly all will cover you if you get ill. Relatively few offer Covid-related cancellation cover though. Winter sport specialists MPI Brokers and Battleface have specific policies for snow-sport fans looking for extra cover, for coronavirus, ski-specific claims or travel against Foreign Office advice. Before booking, you need to check explicitly the policy of the operator or airline you are dealing with and whether they will allow you to cancel without penalty if there is another lockdown or travel restrictions are tightened, impacting your ability to travel.

718,0,IT giants mum on how they deal with abusive posts in Japan,485 words,AJW (Asia & Japan Watch),"An expert panel of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has asked companies, including social media networks, to disclose how many harmful messages they have deleted in Japan. The panel also asked them to describe how they respond to requests in Japan to delete such messages, as well as what countermeasures they have in place to prevent abusive messages from being posted. However, most of the companies refused to disclose such information at the panelâs hearing held on March 7.  Twitter, for example, mentioned how many requests it had received from courts and others to delete defamatory and slanderous tweets, but it would not say how many posts it had actually deleted.  Meta, formally Facebook, Google and Twitter all declined to describe their systems or arrangements in Japan to respond to requests for the removal of harmful posts. In contrast, Yahoo Japan Corp. and Line Corp., which operate mainly in Japan, disclosed numbers, figures and operational details concerning the issue. The IT giants said one reason they could not disclose the requested information is that it is difficult to identify which deleted messages were initially posted by someone in Japan. They also said that their teams that are handling these issues operate globally, making it tough to accurately say how many employees are devoted to Japanese cases. A representative from Twitter even asked the panel members what benefit could come from disclosing such information. A panel member later said the hearing made it clear that companies will not disclose information unless there is a legal framework requiring them to do so. Currently in Japan, people targeted by defamatory and slanderous messages online can use the Provider Liability LimitationÂ Law to ask social media companies and others to disclose information about those who uploaded the abusive posts. But how to deal with such posts is largely left to the discretion of each company, reflecting the governmentâs stance of supporting freedom of expression. The ministryâs consultation center on illegal and harmful online information handled 5,407 cases in fiscal 2020, a fourfold increase over the previous 10 years. The center advises people on how to deal with illegal and harmful information posted online. Calls for tougher measures to prevent online harassment increased after Hana Kimura, a professional wrestler, committed suicide in 2020 after becoming the target of online abuse following an appearance in the âTerrace Houseï¿½?reality television program."
162,0,Breville brews up Italian coffee deal,516 words,The Australian - Online,"Breville announced on Friday that half of deal will be paid in cash and half by the issue of fully paid ordinary shares in Breville priced at $27.64 apiece which will be subject to a five-year trading lock post completion. Shares in Breville last traded at $26.98.  Breville said the cash portion will be funded from existing reserves and debt facilities and that key members of the LELIT Group management team, including the founders, have agreed to join the company Founded in Castegnato, Italy in 1985, LELIT designs, manufactures, and markets premium prosumer home coffee equipment in Europe and throughout the world. Prosumer coffee machines are professional looking coffee machines, with all the bells and whistles of a commercial device that could be at home in a cafe or restaurant but are aimed at the consumer, at-home market. LELIT coffee machines can sell for as much as $5000 and have state of the art technology and machinery that can be used by professionals baristas but also people at home who desire a coffee made on a commercial device.  Breville already has an existing coffee machine business along with its portfolio of other kitchen appliances.  Breville said as a rapidly growing disrupter in the premium Italian-made espresso machine and grinder market, LELIT complements Brevilleâs award-winning coffee portfolio and brings together two iconic companies in the design and distribution of pre-eminent home coffee equipment. Breville chief executive Jim Clayton said the deal brought together the two great coffee cultures of the world: Italy and Australia. âBoth companies have a shared passion for using product innovation to improve our customersï¿½?coffee experience at home, and we look forward to working alongside LELIT and its existing partners to further accelerate its growth and product innovation, while preserving the values that underpin its Italian identityï¿½? The transaction is expected to complete by early July 2022 following a pre-acquisition restructure of the Italian company. LELIT chief executive, Emanuele Epis, said: âBreville Group is the ideal strategic partner to support LELIT in its next stage of growth, at the same time enabling us to remain faithful to our Italian heritage and design. âWe look forward to leveraging Brevilleâs global platforms, capabilities and infrastructure to further strengthen our success on a global scale.ï¿½?Last month Breville ï¿½?which counts Mr Lewâs retail business Premier Investments as its biggest shareholder with a stake of just under 26 per cent ï¿½?booked a 25 per cent jump in interim profit to $77.7m as sales rose around 24 per cent to $878.7m."
254,0,"Sainsbury's to SHUT 200 of its cafes this Spring putting 2,000 jobs at risk as it announces plans to open STARBUCKS in 30 of its UK locations",643 words,Mail Online,"* It is also looking into opening Starbucks in 30 of its stores across the UK Sainsburyâs is set to shut 200 cafes this spring, the supermarket announced today amid concerns over rising costs. It will also close 34 hot food counters, and 'simplify' the running of 54 bakeries in its stores. London, Bristol, York and other UK cities will all see Sainsbury's cafes permanently close from next month. Only 67 will remain open. Britain's second-largest supermarket said it was closing the cafes to 'transform' its eat-in offer for shoppers. Later this year it will open 30 Starbuck's branches in stores, and another 30 restaurants from the chain that runs Gourmet Burger Kitchen and Ed's Diner. Chief executive Simon Roberts said: 'We are really excited about this new customer offer we will be rolling out over the next two to three years across many of our stores.' Sainsbury's saw its sales spike during the pandemic amid panic-buying and the closure of hospitality venues ï¿½?along with other supermarkets. But despite the surge, its profits fell 39 per cent to Â£356million before tax over the financial year to March 2021, the latest available. Bosses at the chain blamed expensive Covid safety measures and continuing to pay business rates even after the rules were relaxed. Today's announcement comes after the supermarket permanently closed all of its meat, fish and deli counters more than a year ago. Despite opposition to the move, the supermarket said they would be closed due to 'reduced consumer demand' and to make its stores easier to run. Sainsburyâs revealed plans to close 200 of its cafes to staff this morning. It said workers affected by the closures will be prioritised for vacant roles in stores and will be encouraged to apply for jobs elsewhere in the business. In April last year, Sainsburyâs said 1,200 jobs were at risk from plans to stop baking products in some stores, while it cut around 3,500 jobs due to the closure of fresh meat and fish counters in November 2020. Chief executive Simon Roberts said: 'As we go through this period of transition, we have taken the difficult decision to close 200 of our cafes next month. 'We have spoken to all colleagues affected by these changes today and are absolutely committed to supporting them in any way we can during this uncertain time. 'Of course, we understand this is very unsettling for our colleagues, but we must keep adapting our business to make sure we are offering customers the best possible food and drink at affordable prices. 'We are totally focused on improving what we can deliver for our customers and, at the same time, working hard to make our business simpler.' Which Sainsbury's cafes are staying open?

914,0,How ProPublica and The Post researched posts of Facebook groups,883 words,Washington Post.com,"Many of these groups disappeared from public view during the period of our analysis. To determine when groups focused on U.S. politics within our data set went offline, we analyzed the more than 5,000 groups that had meaningful activity (more than 10 posts tracked) but were no longer online as of Aug. 30, 2021. We hand-labeled each group as political if its name and description showed that it was created to represent or support a U.S. political interest or group, to be a forum for U.S. political speech, or to represent or discuss a social or cultural movement with a strong connection to U.S. politics (national or local). We ultimately found more than 2,500 such groups, including those for and against various parties, candidates and issues across the political spectrum; groups for various kinds of political memes and discussions; and groups for movements such as the QAnon conspiracy theory, militia groups and Stop the Steal. We then estimated the time of disappearance for each of these 2,500-plus U.S. political groups by taking the latest date seen on their posts and other group activity. Based on our reporting and the timing of spikes in group disappearances, which often coincided with Facebook's announcements of group suspensions, we believe the majority of them were removed by Facebook. However, some may have been deleted or removed from public view by their own administrators. We shared the list of more than 2,500 groups with Facebook and asked it to clarify whether they were removed by the company or taken offline by their own administrators. Facebook did not respond to our questions about these groups or any other of our quantitative findings. We used these labeled offline groups to predict which of the still-online groups within our sample were also U.S. political groups. We used posts from the offline groups to train a text classification model to predict whether a post was from a U.S. political group and ran it against all the posts from each group in our data set. We labeled a group as a likely U.S. political Facebook group when the mean prediction for its posts was over 0.5 (1.0 indicates that the model predicts with maximum probability that the post is from a U.S. political group). We used this labeling method to identify over 27,000 likely U.S. political groups with posts between Election Day and Jan 6. We hand-checked a sample of the groups to calculate an estimate of the proportion of groups that were actually U.S. political groups, and got a precision rate of about 79 percent. To count the number of posts that specifically sought to delegitimize the election results, we examined 18.7 million posts from Election Day through Jan. 6 within the likely U.S. political Facebook groups. We separated out posts from groups with ""Stop the Steal"" in their name and calculated which keywords and phrases were disproportionately common in posts from those groups using a text-analysis technique called TF-IDF. Then, we handpicked the terms and keywords that were meaningfully linked to election delegitimization theories (e.g., ""stop the steal,"" ""steal the election,"" ""every legal vote""). We had about 60 terms that indicated delegitimization on their own, plus 86 more in two buckets that, if terms from both buckets were present, indicated delegitimization (e.g., a reference to absentee ballots on its own did not indicate delegitimization, but a reference to ""absentee ballots"" and ""fraud"" did.) We identified about 1.03 million posts that likely referenced delegitimization. Finally, we hand-checked a sample of these posts to estimate the proportion that actually sought to delegitimize the election, and got a precision rate of about 64 percent. (False positives included mainstream news articles, debunks of fraud claims, and references to other countries' elections.) We arrived at our final estimate of delegitimizing posts by multiplying the two together, to get an estimate of a bit more than 655,000. Because of CounterAction's sampling method, the groups we analyzed are likely to contain a greater proportion of right-wing groups than the platform as a whole. The activity of the right-wing groups we analyzed matches with the findings of our reporting, and group activity in our sample coincided with Facebook's public announcements about group removals. However, we would need additional outside data to analyze whether groups in our sample are representative of the broader platform. We sampled and checked precision rates in our analysis based on a 5 percent margin of error and 95 percent confidence level."

Many people thought of the movie 'The Pianist,' the movie depicting a Polish Jewish musician struggling to survive the Holocaust. Leaming's video was flooded with over 2,000 comments, such as 'It's like a scene from the movie 'Titanic,' where the musicians played music on a sinking ship[.]', and 'My heart is broken.' The music's composers, Philip Glass and Paul Leonard-Morgan, who are one of the prominent minimalist composers, also saw the video. Glass released a statement on Tuesday, saying, 'I never thought of this music as a political piece, but it has become one. Innocent people are living through difficulties we all hope to never face.' Leonard-Morgan also shared the video on his Twitter account and commented. 'My heart was moved beyond words by the fact that someone found comfort in our music in the most tragic moment of his life,' he said. 'I do not know whether the boy found comfort and hope in the song, but music has power to overcome adversity.' The boy's identity is unknown. Leaming said she left the hotel a few minutes later to cover the news and that she never saw the boy and his family again."
433,0,"A Town That Saved a Mountain, and a Mountain That Saved a Town",1981 words,NYTimes.com Feed,"Mr. Lyall beckoned me up an old chairlift ramp. He swept his ski pole across the panorama and pointed to the snow-covered summits of Okemo and Killington, ski resorts that lie within a 30-mile radius. The White Mountains of New Hampshire felt close enough to touch. âThere would be many times that I would stand up here and watch storms dump snow on those ski areas and just bypass Ascutney. We couldnât win,ï¿½?said Mr. Lyall, an avid backcountry skier. In its heyday, the Ascutney ski resort boasted 1,800 vertical feet of skiing on over 50 trails, and included a high-speed quad chairlift, three triple chairlifts and a double chairlift. But when it closed in 2010 because of scant snow and mismanagement (twin killers of small ski resorts), it threatened to take with it the nearby community of West Windsor, Vt., population 1,099. âProperty values plummeted, condos on the mountain saw their value decrease by more than half, and taxes went up,ï¿½?recalled Glenn Seward, who worked at the resort for 18 years, once as the director of mountain operations. The townâs general store, the gathering place of the community, also went broke and closed. âWe were desperate,ï¿½?said Mr. Seward, who at the time was chair of the West Windsor Selectboard, a Vermont townâs equivalent of a city council. That desperation led the community to hitch its fortune to the mountain, becoming a model for how a small ski area and its community can thrive in the era of climate change. Working with the state of Vermont as well as the nonprofit Trust for Public Land, the town bought the failed ski area in 2015. But instead of allowing a private company to run the mountain, contracting out its operations, the local residents themselves would chart a sustainable, volunteer-driven path for the ski area. Seven years later, Mount Ascutney and West Windsor are magnets for families and outdoor enthusiasts. Between 2010 and 2020, the townâs population jumped over 20 percent and median single-family home sale prices more than doubled, to $329,750. A bustling new general store featuring local products has opened in the village of Brownsville, reinvigorating the center of the West Windsor community. The town and mountain draw people year round, from endurance runners and mountain bikers in the warm months to skiers in winter. At the heart of this revival is Ascutney Outdoors[https://www.ascutneyoutdoors.org/], a nonprofit with over 100 volunteers that now runs recreation on the mountain. Instead of high-speed quads and snow-making, skiers take a rope tow or T-bar that accesses 435-vertical feet of skiing, found on 10 natural-snow trails that are groomed. There is also a lift for snow tubing. A lift ticket costs $20, or $100 for a season pass. The lifts run on Saturday and Sunday when there is enough snow, and it takes about 40 volunteers to staff a busy weekend. The upper 1,300 vertical feet of the mountain, maintained by Ascutney Trails Association, is reserved for backcountry skiers to skin up and ski down for free ï¿½?though donations are appreciated. Thursday night ski races take place under lights, and an after-school program brings children to the mountain every afternoon. The mountain is also home to 45 miles of renowned mountain bike trails, numerous hiking trail[https://www.ascutneytrails.com/]s and Mt. Ascutney State Park[https://vtstateparks.com/ascutney.html]. It is one of the top hang-gliding sites in New England. âWhen thereâs snow, we ski, and when thereâs not, we do other things,ï¿½?said Mr. Seward, who is now executive director of Ascutney Outdoors. âThatâs a pretty easy model to sustain.ï¿½?âWe lost our identity as a ski townï¿½?Mount Ascutney (elevation 3,144 feet), Vermontâs most famous volcano, has lured skiers for decades. Skiing began on Ascutney in the winter of 1935-36[https://www.newenglandskihistory.com/Vermont/ascutney.php] on the 5,400-foot long Mount Ascutney Trail, opened by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Windsor Outing Club. The first skiers skinned up the mountain under their own power, just like backcountry skiers today. The Mt. Ascutney ski area opened in 1946 with rope tows. In a harbinger of the struggles to come, the ski area endured several poor winters and went bankrupt four years after opening. New owners periodically came and went and Ascutney remade itself as a destination resort, attracting tourists and second-home owners from New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts. It was described in a 2005 New York Times article[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/02/travel/escapes/snow-yes-crowds-no.html] as âless fashionable than some of its competitorsï¿½?with a base lodge that was âsmall and utilitarian.ï¿½?Local skiers continued to be its loyal mainstay. Ascutney Resort was bedeviled by years of erratic snow levels. In the 1980s, a new ownership group, Summit Ventures, poured $55 million into lifts, condos and snow-making. A hotel was built at the foot of the mountain (it is now a Holiday Inn Club Vacations). By 1991, the ski area was forced into liquidation. The ski resort closed for the final time in 2010 and sold off its lifts. It was a crushing blow for the community. âWe lost our identity as a ski town,ï¿½?said Mr. Seward, who grew up in the community and married his wife, Shelley, on the mountain. Jim Lyall added: âYou saw everyone at the school, the general store, the post office, and at the ski area. We were in jeopardy of losing all four and becoming just a bedroom community.ï¿½?Skiing in a warming world Climate change poses an existential threat to New England ski areas, which now number 89 in six states. A 2019 study[https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/doi/full/10.1080/13683500.2017.1410110] showed that in northeastern states besides Vermont, at least half of ski areas will close by the mid 2050s if high greenhouse gas emissions continue. A study published in 2021 in the journal Climate[https://www-mdpi-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/2225-1154/9/12/176] showed that New England is warming significantly faster than the rest of the planet. From 1900 to 2020, winter temperatures in Vermont rose 5.26 degrees Fahrenheit. âThat means more of our winter precipitation is falling as rain instead of snow, less of it is accumulating on the ground, and there is more midwinter melt,ï¿½?said Elizabeth Burakowski, research assistant professor at the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space at the University of New Hampshire. New England is littered with the ghosts of abandoned ski areas: According to the New England Lost Ski Areas Project[https://www.nelsap.org/], more than 600 ski areas have closed in the region. Ski industry leaders warn that the survival of ski areas depends on political action. âItâs absolutely critical that the business leaders in the outdoor and ski industries come together to strongly advocate for bipartisan climate action at the federal and state levels,ï¿½?said Adrienne Saia Isaac, director of marketing and communications for the National Ski Areas Association. West Windsor was determined to reimagine a future that did not rely on the vagaries of winter. In 2014, the West Windsor Selectboard asked the Trust for Public Land to help it purchase and conserve 469 acres of the former ski area to be used for backcountry skiing, mountain biking and other human-powered recreation. The ski area would be added to the existing town forest and protected by a 1,581-acre conservation easement safeguarding the land from development. A special town meeting was held[https://www.vpr.org/vpr-news/2015-12-25/west-windsor-buys-land-at-closed-mt-ascutney-resort] in October 2014 asking West Windsor voters to approve the town spending $105,000 toward the $640,000 purchase of the former ski area, part of the $905,000 project price to return the land to recreational use. The purchase was approved by a three-to-one margin. In 2015, a group of townspeople gathered at Jim Lyallâs house to start Ascutney Outdoors. A new rope tow was installed that same year, followed by the tubing lift in 2017 and a T-bar in 2020. The community raised funds to build the Ascutney Outdoor Center, a 3,000-square-foot base lodge, at the foot of the mountain. Reviving a community hub  Brownsville Butcher and Pantry[https://www.butcherandpantry.com/] is minutes from Ascutney Outdoors, and their fates are tightly bound. Peter Varkonyi and Lauren Stevens opened the store in November 2018, and on a recent weekday, cheerily greeted a steady stream of customers and regulars. This is not your typical general store. It has a wall of Vermont craft beer and a butcher was carving a side of pork hung from a meat hook in front of refrigerator cases that include Vermont Wagyu beef, fresh goat and all the makings for sushi. In the cafe nearby, customers can choose from homemade bagels and housemade hot pastrami to a vegetarian smoked-beet Reuben and three varieties of burgers. In 2018, a community group, Friends of the Brownsville General Store, bought the foreclosed building from the bank for $95,000 and invested $250,000 to renovate it. The group then leased the building to Mr. Varkonyi and Ms. Stevens for $1 per year, with an option that the couple could purchase it at any time for cost. Chris Nesbitt, an organizer of the Friends group, urged his neighbors to âthink of this like the common good. You are investing in the community.ï¿½?Buying local âis the basis to what we do every day,ï¿½?said Ms. Stevens, proudly itemizing $35,000 in purchases of organic produce from Edgewater Farm[https://www.edgewaterfarm.com/] in Plainfield, N.H., and $30,000 in lamb, goat and pork from Yates Farm just down the road. In 2021, she tallied, âour tiny business put $500,000 back into local businesses.ï¿½?In December, the couple bought the store from the Friends. A lifelong resident of the community and teacher at the local elementary school, Amanda Yates, was sitting with her young son enjoying burger night at the general store. Ms. Yates motioned to the bustling cafe and store. âI credit the store and Ascutney Outdoors with bringing the town back,ï¿½?she said. âThey brought places where you could meet, get good food, where you could see people again around town. âThey really brought back that community hub.ï¿½?David Goodman is the author of âBest Backcountry Skiing in the Northeast[http://www.bestbackcountryskiing.com]ï¿½?(AMC Books) and host of âThe Vermont Conversation,ï¿½?a public affairs radio show and podcast.

218,0,"Yes, I can afford Â£12k for a holiday ï¿½?but I draw the line at a Â£10 rum punch",889 words,sundaytimes.co.uk,"While checking that it had gone through, I noticed just how many subscriptions I have accumulated for services that I now donât use: magazines I no longer read, clubs I donât attend. One is the Groucho Club in Soho ï¿½?you must have heard of it, awfully smart with a long waiting list. I was actually a founder member and investor in 1985. Friends of mine, who were starting it up, said that if I invested Â£3,000 I would get a tax break because of some sort of government scheme to encourage start-ups. That same week I got a letter from Jeffrey Archer, whom I had never met, offering me the chance to put Â£3,000 into a West End theatre. I have no interest in shares, donât have any, but they both seemed interesting, worthwhile projects. Ten years later the Groucho Club was taken over and, on paper, my shares were worth Â£30,000. I have dined out on this story for a decade, showing how clever I was. I rarely mention that the theatre project collapsed in six months and I got nothing back. What a dummy. I had endless meals and parties at the Groucho in the early years, including the first private event held there by a member, in 1985, when I had a party to celebrate my silver wedding. I think it was the only time my wife went. She thought it was pretentious to be a member of any club. I have not been there for about three years, thanks partly to Covid and old age. I do now find it a fag going into the West End. But I was still paying subs. My statements showed Â£97.50 going out regularly, although I canât remember if that was six-monthly or annually. Shows what a financial whizz I am. Anyway, before I went off to the Windies, I decided to cancel my membership. Save myself some money which I could now spend on other things, such as rum punch. You get a free punch when you arrive at the Bequia Beach Hotel, which gives me such pleasure, as I do love free things. After that you have to pay their bar prices Bloody hell, after two days I suddenly realised that each rum punch, for me and my holiday companion, was costing me Â£10. We will have to cut down, pet, I told her. Next day at Knights Supermarket in Port Elizabeth I noticed that a bottle of local Sparrowâs rum was only 27 EC dollars ï¿½?about Â£7. I then bought a bottle of fruit juice at 10 EC dollars and a packet of grated nutmeg at 4 EC. Hope you are following all this fascinating info and adding it up your head. The point is that we got 13 glasses of rum punch out of one bottle which we mixed ourselves, for us and also treating our friends. In other words, 13 rum punches for about the price of one glass at the bar. I was well made up. Highlight of the hols. I later stupidly boasted about what we were doing to Philip, the son of the hotel owner, Bengt, half fearing he might say âOut, out, we donât want cheapskates like you making their own drinks in the hotelï¿½? But he just smiled. âThe bar price for rum punch is to stop people like you having too many.ï¿½?Good one, Philip. And, of course, true. Our homemade version did seem stronger. I went to bed each night staggering. But very happy. I was even happier when I got home. Guess how the Groucho had replied to my resignation? Go on. Indulge me. They have made me an âhonorary memberï¿½? which I did not know existed. So I will not have to pay subs again, as long as I am alive, which canât be all that long, not at the rate I am now drinking sauvignon blanc. After saving a bloody fortune making our own rum punches, I am now working on a plan to sneak in a bottle of Tescoâs Chilean sauvignon blanc, a bargain at Â£3.89, when I next go for lunch at the Groucho. Instead of paying Â£30, or whatever they now charge. Yes, I know someone who can afford to pay a fortune on a Windies luxury hol can afford to pay hotel and club prices for drinks. But all my life it has always given me such pleasure to save money by buying raspberries from a street stall at Â£1 despite knowing that next day when I have them on my muesli half will be mouldy. Do I care? Of course not. Such pleasure in being mean and penny-pinching, while at the same time spending loads."
314,0,Meituan Shows China Tech Isn't Delivering Yet; Investors were hoping for a reprieve from the regulatory crackdown that punished shares in 2021,512 words,The Wall Street Journal Online,"Friday's policy guidelines, from the state economic planner and 13 other government bodies, aim to help industries that have been hit hard by the pandemic such as restaurants and retail. The guidelines also include other measures meant to support the service sector such as tax breaks and subsidies. China's retail sales have been lagging behind other drivers of economic growth. Small- and medium-size businesses are doing particularly poorly [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/chinese-small-businesses-no-good-very-bad-year-11640954205]. There is no mention of how, or for how long online food-delivery platforms should cut fees. Meituan's take of every dollar spent on food delivery on its platform in the third quarter of 2021 was around 13.4%. Morgan Stanley estimates that a one-percentage-point drop in that monetization rate would lower Meituan's overall food-delivery revenue by 7%. Meituan made more than half of its revenue from food delivery in the third quarter, though its higher-margin hotel and travel segment delivered higher profits. The market may be overreacting if this proves to be only a short-term measure to shore up struggling restaurateurs. Meituan provided subsidies and rebates to its merchants at the outset of China's initial Covid-19 outbreak in 2020, but its sales quickly recovered after the pandemic there came under control. But investors seem to be taking away a harsher message. Other Chinese technology stocks, which shouldn't really see much direct impact from the new guidelines have fallen too. Alibaba and Tencent have both dropped around 7% in the past two trading days. Predicting consumer-technology companies' long-term growth and profits obviously becomes more difficult if their pursuit clashes with other high-level objectives of Beijing, such as curbing large private conglomerates' market power. Such worries were, of course, behind the precipitous declines in Chinese tech stocks [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/beijing-gives-tech-investors-a-brutal-new-tutorial-11627377792] last year. These new guidelines show shares aren't out of the woods yet by any means. Moreover, with China apparently prepared to stick with its ""zero-Covid"" approach for quite some time still, service-sector consumption in general could be a long time recovering. China's tech sector had been relatively resilient this year compared with the carnage in the U.S. Now investors are realizing they may have been too complacent: Regulatory risks clearly aren't going away yet.

922,0,New restaurant restrictions come into force today - doors close as early as six p.m.*** TRANSLATED ***,206 words,STT,"Restrictions will be introduced in all distribution areas, ie in all provinces in Finland, the Government press release said on Tuesday. The restaurant is open to guests from 05:00 until 18:00. The restriction also applies to restaurants that do not dispense alcoholic beverages. The number of customer seats is also limited. In restaurants where alcohol is the main business area, only half of the customer seats are used indoors and outdoors. In other catering establishments, 75 per cent of the customer seats may be used indoors. In addition, restrictions on the use of the corona passport will be extended until the end of January. In practice, this means that the corona passport cannot be used as an alternative to regional restrictions. The government said on Tuesday it had amended a decree restricting the activities of catering businesses to prevent the spread of the corona epidemic. *** DISCLAIMER: THIS IS AN AUTOMATED TRANSLATION FROM FINNISH ***"

Tata Motors, which has the largest market share in the Indian CV industry also reported that its sales in the fourth quarter of FY22 were recorded at 1,10,027 units, which was around 21 per cent higher than the previous quarter (Q3 FY22) and 12 per cent higher than the same quarter last year (Q4 FY21). MHCV Segment âThe medium and heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) segment grew by more than 51 per cent compared to the previous quarter, while being 20 per cent ahead of the same quarter (Q4) last year, owing to increased activity in road construction, mining and improved infrastructure spending by the Central and State governments,ï¿½?Girish Wagh, Executive Director, Tata Motors said recently. Early signs of recovery have also been observed in the otherwise worst-affected CV passenger segment, he added. âWe are cautiously optimistic about domestic MHCV and intermediate and light commercial vehicle (ILCV) demand while keeping a close eye on geopolitical developments, fuel inflation and semiconductor shortage,ï¿½?he said.

900,0,Highlights: Austrian Talk Shows German 9-11 Jan 22,2353 words,BBC Monitoring Europe,"Surviving Omicron ""Omicron is a race between a mutation-happy virus and a corona-fatigued population. Who will win remains an open matter. The government is trying a paradigm change. The accompanying concept does not contribute to calming things down: Controlled infestation. This strategy is generating more questions than answers. Is this how a collapse of the healthcare system, schools, kindergartens, businesses will be prevented?"" wondered presenter Claudia Reiterer, speaking on political talk show Im Zentrum on 9 January. Reiterer was discussing Austria's recent emergence from lockdown, only to slide into major worries that fast-rising infection rates with the Omicron variant could take the public health system to its limits, requiring new restrictions. Asked how Austria could prepare for the impending Omicron wave, World Health Organisation (WHO) representative Gerald Rockenschaub said: ""I believe that what can be said first of all is that everyone is frustrated at the beginning of the third corona year, and that is understandable. We have about 300 million positive corona cases to show, and 5.4 million deaths from Covid or because of Covid. Everyone is tired, but unfortunately, the virus is not tired and keeps surprising us with new mutations, such as this Omicron variant, which is significantly more infectious than previous variants. And I believe the key is for us to use the time to prepare our healthcare systems adequately."" Rockenschaub further said that to prevent further mutations of Covid-19, ""we must ensure that we immunise as many people as possible globally, through an expansion of vaccinations"". Asked whether hopes of milder illnesses resulting from Omicron were justified, Rockenschaub said: ""Well, we do see with Omicron that the individual clinical courses [the disease takes] is milder. That is true, but we are seeing this above all in countries where first of all we have a higher vaccination rate than is still the case in Austria, such as England, Denmark, Israel."" ""What we also cannot estimate yet is how Omicron will behave in a population in which vaccination rate is a little lower, and in which we still have a great many unvaccinated people in the high-risk category,"" Rockenschaub said, referring to Austria's relatively low vaccination rate. Asked how high the Omicron wave was likely to become in Austria, mathematical modeller Peter Klimek said: ""That will depend very significantly on how we all respond to this rise we are seeing here."" Klimek noted that if the government took no further action, 10%-20% of the population would get infected ""before the wave slows by itself"". ""This is simply the second run through, this is an immunological escape variant, and there is now an extreme potential for how many people can still get infected in the population,"" Klimek added. Klimek further said that even if a light lockdown were imposed immediately, ""we would still estimate that we will not really push down this wave, but only significantly flatten it, but we would not quickly get into a sustained lowering of infection rates"". ""And there, the question arises of what has already been mentioned, which is whether this is still a realistic option at all with the pandemic fatigue which exists again,"" Klimek continued, adding that booster shots were essential for protecting the vulnerable parts of the population, short of going into another lockdown. Asked whether strict measures were required immediately, Klimek said: ""Because it is also unrealistic that we are going into a hard lockdown like in March 2020, it must be said very clearly that if we are unable to prevent this wave or do not want to, the only way for measures to still make sense is if we use the time to conduct more booster shots especially in the older population."" Government perspective ""We have only just ended a lockdown and have only opened things up in a minimal way, so to speak. We have done precisely what is possible for a little normality in our country. We all know this is far removed from our normal normality. And from this situation forward, the goal is now to secure the path by getting through the wave through immunisation via vaccination,"" said Katharina Reich, director-general for public health at the Federal Health Ministry. Asked why the Austrian government seemed to be going for a strategy of controlled infestation with Omicron, even though German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach had rejected such an approach as irresponsible, Reich said: ""In my opinion, we should move away from this concept, also because it was not mentioned [within the government's expert council]."" ""Omicron will come to us as a wave, that is a fact. It is a fact that we know how we can protect ourselves, and that there is an extremely strict and varied bundle of measures on the table, which we must all respect. And that is the point,"" Reich added. ""Every single one of us has control over whether the measures are respected,"" Reich continued. ""The alternative is in fact to lock things up, one thing after another, go lock down the entire country. We can do that when the health resources get to their limits. That is something we have had to do before, and I do not rule out that we will have to do it again if our healthcare resources reach their limits,"" Reich further said. Problems with working from home ""We can certainly state that the world of work has been put upside down because of corona. We have experienced short-time labour, job losses, closures of businesses. All of that comes with losses of income, and it has brought a number of people to reach the poverty line. We have seen that employees have reached their limits. And I would certainly like to emphasise that it was generally the women who were really up to the limit, as were certain groups of employees,"" said Renate Anderl, chair of the Chamber for Workers and Employees, also speaking on Im Zentrum. Anderl added that among other problems facing employees and businesses was the lack of testing centres to ensure Covid-19 safety in the workplace, noting that ""there are still a few states in which the testing strategy is almost completely unavailable, especially in the rural areas"". Furthermore, working from home is only possible for 40% of employees, Anderl said, adding that the government should not forget working conditions there, and focus on ""what happens to those employees who are constantly sent to work from home, and especially those who have no option to work properly there"". Reich said that ""our test system is set up well, compared to others. That does not mean it is already optimal"". Mandatory vaccination ""We have always argued that mandatory vaccination should be viewed as a last resort, when all other means have been exhausted and these other means cannot sufficiently achieve the vaccination targets, and then only on the basis of a very broad societal debate, which is currently taking place in Austria,"" Rockenschaub said, when asked to state the WHO's position on mandatory vaccination. Anderl said that while she favoured mandatory vaccination because there appeared to be no alternative, ""we are viewing it very critically, and we are critical because we are simply missing educational outreach before starting something like this"". ""We never did that, which is very sad. Many people have fears, and there is nobody to take away the fears,"" Anderl continued. Austria gets a new body for preventing climate change ""The Citizens' Climate Council, as I believe it is called, is a common ground between political leaders who are elected in our democratic system, and society, which is not organised in lobby-groups, so to speak. And this has proved itself in many countries for the most varied topics, to somehow reflect the society of a state, municipality, or region within a miniature version of Austria, where you hope that as many opinions and perspectives on the topic will come together,"" said climate expert Professor Georg Kaser, speaking on current affairs talk show Nachgefragt on 11 January. Kaser was discussing the establishment of the Citizens' Climate Council at the initiative of environment minister Leonore Gewessler (Greens), in which a group of 100 Austrian citizens, selected to reflect the Austrian population, was to work out concrete proposals for how Austria could become fully climate-neutral by 2040 without hurting society or the economy. Kaser has been part of the council's scientific advisory team. Kaser noted that the proposals generated by the council ""cannot automatically be put into law, that is not possible in representative democracy, and it should not be. That would be a false expectation"". However, Kaser also noted that the ambition was that proposals submitted by the council would be heard and ""live on, perhaps right up to changes in law"". Kaser further said that talks within the council were subjected to ""a kind of Chatham House rule thing, meaning that you can discuss things, but it must not be made public who said what, because then conflicts are brought in"". Asked whether this participatory model was going to change anything about the fact that some people, including in Austria, would need to make significant lifestyle changes to protect the environment, Kaser said: ""You can also consider that in entirely different dimensions, namely global ones. There too, we will have to strive for a kind of justice. You can basically call it climate justice, but it will be social justice, a justice of eco-systems, since it is not just about the climate. And global society will certainly look different 20-30 years from now, either by design or disaster, as a friend of mine says."" ""The European green deal and all of these plans are fantastic. We could not have imagined them three or four years ago, but they are coming in 20 years too late, that is when we should have stated taking these steps, and we would have had time to guide it. Now, much will probably only happen in a rushed way,"" Kaser. Austrian media reform plans ""It is important for me that we are now starting a process of conferences in which we will speak about precisely these things, about how we can improve on transparency and clarity, how we can develop new criteria based on which the state can fulfil these needs for information. But it is also clear that it is important for us to have the ability to inform the public, that is legitimate and necessary, for example, about corona measures, about measures against domestic violence, when there are job openings at ministries,"" said women's minister Susanne Raab (Austrian People's Party, OeVP), speaking on news show Puls24 News on 11 January. Raab was speaking about her plans to reform the Austrian media landscape, which now falls within her remit due to a reshuffle following the resignations of two federal chancellors. Plans include a process to change the criteria based on which the government distributes advertising among the country's media outlet. Lucrative government purchases of advertising space in media outlets has been a controversial topic following numerous allegations against Austrian leaders for allegedly favouring certain outlets over others. Asked whether the government planned to introduce a cap on how much advertising can be contracted through individual media outlets, Raab said: ""I cannot say anything definitive about that. There are different options available that will be discussed in the context of these conferences. On the other hand, corona has demonstrated how important it is that the media can give comprehensive information about corona measures, vaccination, hygiene measures, or measures against violence."" There are also plans to reform the way in which the government subsidises Austrian media outlets, to favour media diversity. Asked whether Austrian media outlets would receive higher funding in the coming years, Raab said: ""Overall, it is important for me that both media cooperatives and media subsidies result in a picture that allows us to strengthen Austria's media climate. That is my task as minister. I would like to uphold the variety and plurality of the media. The media are a very important corrective. It is important that the media climate in Austria holds up in the face of a large German-speaking realm."" Asked whether quality levels and respect for democratic values would become criteria for funding, Raab said: ""I do not want to make a definitive statement on what these criteria will look like. There will be this process [of discussions with media representatives]. But one thing is also clear: I do not want politics to decide what is a quality media outlet and what is not."" Raab further noted that additional funding would be available to help digitise Austrian media: ""This year, we will make available 54 million [euros] in digitisation subsidies for the media. This is about a classic media outlet, such as a print media outlet, getting the chance to be able to better shape the transformation process into the digital age."" This funding was also meant to help protect against fake news and the influence of large global media companies, including US internet giants, Raab said: ""This is important because we see that especially the young are increasingly strongly consuming media online. We are supporting that because disinformation campaigns and fake news come to Austria via the internet giants."" Source: BBC Monitoring 11 Jan 22"

46,0,Omicron-hit hotel bookings to recover once international travel resumes: Report,460 words,Mint,"As compared to January , February saw huge jump in bookings for destinations like Pondicherry, Mysore, Goa, Mumbai. Mumbai was the leader in the metro cities followed by Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai and Kolkata, according to the report. The strong growth in Delhi and Mumbai suggested higher activity on international airports as well as resumption of business travel, said the firm. Cities in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh registered a degrowth as state elections began in February 2022 and so tourism and business activity was lower. There was also a degrowth in most numbers when compared to last year due to the fact that weddings were restricted to 200 guests in most cities from January when omicron hit till the end of February. Schools and offices, too, in most cities resumed in February and therefore overall leisure travel in the month was much lower. International travel trends: India, UAE, United States and Mexico are showing the least growth as travel in February last year was already touching pre-Covid levels and therefore YoY levels are not as high as other countries. India's growth in travel was 10% in February 2022 versus February 2021. In comparison, countries like France and Japan showed 532% and 743% growth respectively. European countries such as France, Italy, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom are showing the sharpest recovery compared to last year where Covid restrictions have been relaxed. Asian and American travellers are also expected to resume international travel for the first time in two years. Except China, Hong Kong, where Covid cases are rising, and Russia, where international travel is banned, other countries are showing a growth in travel as compared to last year.

498,1,Ex-Highland Capital Partner revives alternative credit strategy following decade-long legal battle close,755 words,Dallas Business Journal,"Last month after a decade of lawsuits and litigation, Daugherty was awarded claims as part of Dallas-based alternative investment platform Highland Capital Management LP's bankruptcy plan. (Highland Capital Management LP is a separate entity from Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors LP, the latter of which is still managed by James Dondero.) Daugherty was also awarded 100% ownership of two no-asset Highland Capital Management LP subsidiaries and a lump sum payment, effective April 1. He and the newly formed team will use one of the subsidiaries, Highland ERA Management, to renew the alternative credit strategy developed 20 years ago.  Highland Capital started the Crusader Fund in 2000 after the dot-com bubble burst to buy distressed corporate loans, which trade at discounts due to the companyâs likelihood of defaulting on its debt obligations. Daugherty said the fund started with $20 million ï¿½?half from Highland and half from an external investor ï¿½?and entered the 2008 financial crisis with $10 billion. He said he thinks the new platform will track similar growth or better. The team will target credits in middle market and broadly syndicated corporate loans and equity and mezzanine tranches of third-party-managed collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) traded on the secondary market. Still, Daugherty said the platform wonât go after control positions. âWe're going to have a bottoms-up analysis of credits themselves, which will allow us to make investment decisions on the equity that those loan assets are housed in via the CLOs,ï¿½?Daugherty said. âWeâll go all the way up through the mezzanine.ï¿½?The strategy leans away from aggressively pursuing CLOs under current market conditions. Daugherty told Dallas Business Journal the team might launch one CLO initially to serve as a platform to roll in deals down the line. He said that CLOs are volatile, and he thinks inflation, which hit a new high this week as the consumer price index rose 8.5% year-over-year, per Labor Department data, will be bad for highly-leveraged assets within CLOs. He added that although CLOs withstand time well, institutional investors like mutual funds, hedge funds, pension funds and insurance companies have mark-to-market losses annually on their books, which he thinks would be exacerbated by the current environment. âThere's a lot of pain that can be incurredâ¦it can be pretty scary in downtimes. I saw that in 1999 to 2002,ï¿½?Daugherty said on CLO's effect on institutional investors. âWe've got massive inflation, and we've got the Fed increasing rates. This is starting to look a lot like 1999 to 2002 when the air is coming out of the balloon, albeit for different reasons.ï¿½?Glacier Lake Capital Advisors, an alternative investment firm founded by Daugherty and Rourke in 2015, will act as sub-advisor to the platform, with Daugherty serving as CEO and chief investment officer, Rourke serving as head of research and senior portfolio manager and Chura serving as head of special situations and senior portfolio manager. Daugherty said he hasnât decided whether the firm will keep the Highland brand, merge with Glacier Lake or go forward as a newly-named entity. He added heâs evaluating potential partnerships with private equity firms, which would potentially provide faster growth with a well-capitalized partner, but at the cost of material ownership. Daugherty previously worked with Rourke and Chura at Highland on CLOs, distressed investments, and restructuring, including investments in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and SunCom Wireless. The team is currently eight to 10 folks, but Daugherty said he plans to hire more experienced portfolio managers. He said itâs important that the firm has a different culture from Highland. Though operations will be headquartered in Dallas, heâs open to hybrid work environments.

866,0,Facebook trumpets massive new supercomputer,447 words,Agence France Presse,"The supercomputer, built from thousands of processors, will be used to ""seamlessly analyse text, images, and video together; develop new augmented reality tools; and much more"", the firm said in blog post written by two of its Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers. They envisage developing AI tools that will, among other things, allow people speaking in several different languages to understand each other in real-time. Meta said the machine, known as AI Research SuperCluster (RSC), was already in the top five fastest supercomputers and would become the fastest AI machine in the world when fully built in the next few months. Platforms like Facebook and Google have long been criticised for the way they process and utilise the data they take from their users. The two firms currently face legal cases across the European Union that allege data transfers from the bloc to the United States are illegal. And the AI algorithms that funnel Facebook users towards appealing posts have been criticised for helping to fuel disinformation and hate speech.  Facebook has apologised repeatedly about the adverse effects of its algorithms and has long flagged its investment in content moderators and other measures to tackle problematic posts. The blog on Monday stressed that weeding out harmful content was among the ""critical use cases"" for its AI development. The researchers wrote that high-definition video was creating ever greater demand for processing power at the same time as the company was pushing for AI tools based on trillions of examples. ""We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together,"" wrote the researchers. ""Ultimately, the work done with RSC will pave the way toward building technologies for the next major computing platform -- the metaverse, where AI-driven applications and products will play an important role."" Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg has been pushing harder than his big tech rivals to develop the idea of the metaverse, which envisages an immersive 3D internet enabled by virtual reality headsets and sensor equipment.  Facebook has not yet confirmed the location of its supercomputer, telling AFP the information was confidential. lby-jxb/spm"
961,0,SEAFOOD'S BIG FISH,766 words,The Advertiser,"âRegardless of what their political beliefs are, China is the biggest economy in the world and weâve got to work with them,ï¿½?he said. âTheyâre rejecting our lobsters and tuna and taking them from other parts of the world. It will cost us deeply ï¿½?millions and millions of dollars.ï¿½?Mr Stehr, founder of the Stehr Group, based in Port Lincoln, is not shy about speaking his mind. The Stehr family is synonymous with the southern bluefin tuna-fishing industry, not just in South Australia, but across the country. Hagenâs son, Marcus, is managing director and a director of seafood supply company Clean Seas, and grandson Saxon also works at for the Stehr Group. Wife Anna is a company director, while daughter Yasmin Stehr co-owns Oceanic Victor, which runs the swim-in aquarium at Victor Harbor and The Island Cafe on Granite Island. In 1997, Mr Stehr set up the Australian Maritime and Fishing Academy at Port Adelaide. The next year, he was named an Officer in the Order of Australia for services to the industry. EYRE PENINSULA SEAFOODS THE countryâs largest producer of blue mussels was formed from a merger of Kinkawooka Mussels and Boston Bay Mussels. Eyre Peninsula Seafoods executive director Andrew Puglisi and father Bob formed Kinkawooka Mussels in 2000 and the two businesses combined in 2016. The company employs about 60 people. Mr Puglisi says while 2021 had been a turbulent year for many, sales were still strong. âMussels is a poor manâs seafood, and itâs been a good year for us,ï¿½?he said of 2021. But it certainly hasnât been all smooth sailing over the past 12 months. His company is leading a charge against SA Waterâs plans to build a desalination plant at Billy Lights Point. The business and many other locals are worried about potential environmental effects associated with hypersaline water from the plant being discharged into Boston and Proper bays. The state government recently announced the project would be put on hold for a year while it worked with SA Water to explore other potential sites for the project. The plant will deliver water to people across the Eyre Peninsula. THOMAS CAPPO SEAFOODS ATTRACTING enough skillÂ­ed workers and supply to meet demand are among the seafood sectorâs biggest challenges in 2022, Damian Cappo says. âSA has exceptional pedigree within the seafood industry with product recognised locally and globally for its high quality,ï¿½?he said. âAt the same time, attracting skilled workers remains an issue with a current shortage of fish filleters and oyster shuckers.ï¿½?However, Mr Cappo said that with the reopening of borders, the market for South Australian produce would grow once again. The Cappo name is synonymous with seafood in SA and the family, in 2017, teamed up with Thomas Foods to expand nationally and internationally. Family members were early Italian migrants and a partnership of six brothers founded the business in Port Pirie in 1919. Third-generation broÂ­thÂ­ers Damian and Matthew Cappo are now the co-directors of Cappo Seafoods, taking over running of the business from their father Maurice. DINKO SEAFOODS FARMING for abalone in Elliston and harvesting seaweed are among new projects on the books for Port Lincoln-based Dinko Seafoods. Dinko Lukin began tuna farming on the Eyre Peninsula in 1966. In the face of government restrictions to address overfishing of southern bluefin tuna in the 1980s, he hatched the idea of farming the species. Fish were harvested as they passed through cold SA waters in late summer. They are transferred to a net and towed back to Port Lincoln where they are put in pens and fed a diet of pilchards, sardines and yellow tail. When Mr Lukin died in July 2011, his wife Lukina Lukin continued the companyâs operations as managing director. She says plans to farm for abalone in Elliston and also to harvest seaweed from its existing operations, are among new opportunities the business will explore in 2022.

The application was dismissed on March 4, two days after Artichoke founder Grant Madgwick, 53, ceased as a director and shareholder in the restaurant. He was replaced by Sydney resident Jamyson Taylor-Leigh Curthill. Artichoke Restaurant was placed into liquidation on April 8, with Jason Bing-Fai Tang of Cor Cordis in Sydney appointed liquidator. Mr Madgwick had vowed in February to re-open after the eatery was fined almost $7000 and ordered to close under the Public Health Act. A former Artichoke staff member last week said Mr Madgwick had abandoned the city to operate another venue further north. Mr Madgwick has created two new companies in the past month, Meatloaf Australia and Roots Catering. Neither has a registered ABN and both are located in Forrest Beach, outside of Ingham.

985,0,Life after Debenhams,1672 words,The Sunday Times,"You would never have guessed that this emporium of leisure was, until recently, a huge Debenhams department store. The only remnants of the building's old occupier are the escalators shuttling punters between the amusement arcade, bowling lanes and an e-sports arena. It is almost a year since the last surviving Debenhams shut its doors for good. Nine in ten former stores remain empty, according to the data provider LDC. A total of 276 branches have been shut by Debenhams, John Lewis, House of Fraser and Marks & Spencer over the past five years. Two-thirds lie vacant with no plans on what to do with them. Once the glue holding town centres together, department stores have become a sorry emblem of their demise. Gravity, however, is thriving. It is attracting 15 per cent more visitors than Debenhams did, and chief executive Harvey Jenkinson is in talks to take leases on another ten vacant department stores. His early success could prove instructive for the dozens of local authorities and property owners desperately in need of a new use for the empty megastores haunting town centres across the country. While the scale of the problem is vast, a number of big redevelopment projects are under way. Department stores are being converted into apartment blocks, offices and even a university campus. The variety of solutions emerging makes it clear there is no silver bullet, though and for the nation's most deprived towns, it is difficult to see any solution at all. The existential challenge posed to department stores by online shopping was exacerbated by the injudicious development of out-of-town retail parks. Over the past two decades, selling space has increased by almost 50 per cent to 126.3 million sq ft, according to data provided by the retail and leisure research firm Trevor Wood Associates. Gloucester is typical. The city's shops had long been in the shadow of wealthier neighbour Cheltenham, before their struggles were compounded by the opening of the Gloucester Quays outlet centre in 2009. But a happier outcome is in sight. Just as the demise of Debenhams threatened to drive another nail in the coffin, last March, Gloucestershire University swept in to buy the huge, five-storey building for Â£3 million. Construction will begin shortly to transform the 50-year-old department store into a campus that will eventually host more than 4,000 students and 350 members of staff. ""By growing the student population in the city, we can provide substantial footfall and an economic boost,"" said Stephen Marston, the vice-chancellor at Gloucestershire University. ""We are rooted in our community, so it is part of our role to be part of how the community reinvents itself."" For the neat solution in Gloucester to be replicated in other university locations, the building must be suitable. The old Debenhams in Gloucester benefits from an art deco facade and huge windows looking out onto the high street. But it is questionable whether students would be enthused about the prospect of lectures held in a windowless box at the back of a shabby shopping centre. Marston acknowledges that the project's Â£60 million cost is a stretch financially, too. The new campus will back onto The Forum, a regeneration project that will create 135,000 sq ft of new offices, 43 new flats and a hotel. For developers, it is easier to make the economics of repurposing a department store stack up if it is part of the wider regeneration of a town. In Altrincham, Cheshire, the property developer Bruntwood Works and Trafford council have formed an alliance to carve up the former House of Fraser store, known as Rackhams, into highspec offices, shops and restaurants. Nearby buildings are also being converted into homes to bring more people into the town centre, theoretically boosting the retailers that remain. The collapse in demand for large shops is forcing landlords to let their department stores to discounters on vastly reduced rents. Chris Dawson, the boss of retail chain The Range, has opened in three vacant Debenhams stores and sees potential to move into about another 15. B&M has moved into five sites vacated by Marks & Spencer at rents that were low enough to justify mothballing the upper floors, which are, in effect, a liability because of the associated business rates. In towns where property prices are above the national average, it is now, in some instances, economically viable to convert department stores into flats. A block of 134 apartments will be built on the site of the former Debenhams in Southsea, situated a short stroll from the beach. Portsmouth city council has granted a local developer planning permission to construct flats on the two top floors of the building, add two new floors of flats on the roof, and build a new block of 36 on the old service yard at the back. In Guildford, an affluent commuter town in Surrey, developer Native Land bought the old Debenhams an enormous 1960s block on the banks of the River Wey for Â£20 million. The building will be demolished and replaced by more than 200 flats, smaller shops, restaurants and a riverside park. Finding a new life for department stores in leafy Surrey is one thing, but solutions remain elusive in the more deprived parts of the country central to the government's levelling-up agenda. High business rates and less affluent local populations make finding new commercial uses difficult, while low residential property values make conversions financially unviable without significant government intervention. Mark Williams, executive director of RivingtonHark, which works with local authorities on regeneration projects, said: ""Just because the space exists doesn't mean it makes sense [to exist]. Much of it is economically defunct and I can see a number of old Debenhams stores just remaining empty."" Few places have been hit harder by the department store wipe-out than Walsall, which has waved goodbye to BHS, Marks & Spencer and Debenhams in the past five years. Despite being one of the most deprived towns in Britain, there are two shopping centres, a high street, a half-empty historic market and a Victorian shopping arcade all located within a five-minute walk around its unloved town centre. The scene in Old Square, the older of Walsall's two shopping centres, is particularly desperate. Just three of the 30 shops inside are occupied, the toilets are permanently closed and the escalators outside the shuttered Debenhams store are blocked off. ""This was our main shopping hall once, but now look at it,"" lamented Cherry Smith, gesturing down the deserted walkway. As a former employee on a Debenhams beauty counter, the 53-year-old feels its absence more than most. ""We were all really shocked when Debenhams closed it has just killed everything else,"" she said. The ripple effects are reverberating through the shopping arcade over the road. ""We are suffering because there has been a dramatic drop-off in footfall,"" said Andrew Plested, owner of clock repair shop the Hand of Time. ""Walsall's market went into decline because shops were deemed more important, but now all the shops are closing."" Maria Till, owner of Arcade Florist, started selling gifts to attract more customers after seeing footfall halve over the previous four years. ""Debenhams going definitely had a big impact nobody wants to come down here any more,"" she said despairingly while cutting flowers for Easter table decorations. Recent history suggests finding a new use for Walsall's Debenhams will be a huge challenge. The former BHS was vacant for three years before a local entrepreneur took on the lease, carved up the ground floor into 35 small units and sub-let them to local traders. Today, about half of them are unoccupied and the top floors are cordoned off entirely. The former Marks & Spencer store remains vacant.  Walsall council is using Â£32 million of central government funding to connect its bus and train stations and relocate a 1,000-seater performing arts venue to the town centre. The Saddlers Centre, a shopping centre that the council bought for Â£13.8 million in 2017, will be modernised and redesigned to open out onto the high street. Simon Neilson, executive director of economy, environment and communities at Walsall council, hopes these initiatives will pave the way for private sector investment but to deliver its 2040 masterplan, the council needs to find almost half a billion pounds. ""We like a challenge in Walsall,"" Neilson said. ""People here are gritty there is an underdog spirit."" Walsall, and dozens of other deprived towns, will need that in spades. Additional reporting by Laith Al-Khalaf OLD SITE, NEW USE The Gravity leisure complex in Wandsworth, southwest London is attracting 15 per cent more visitors than the Debenhams store it replaced. Gravity's chief executive Harvey Jenkinson is in talks to open another ten in former department stores. The University of Gloucestershire plans to turn the former Debenhams store in the centre of Gloucester into a new campus serving more than 4,000 students, helping to invigorate the city's struggling shopping district. STARTING AFRESH Andrew Plested, the owner of Hand of Time in Walsall's central shopping arcade, is suffering in the wake of the closure of the town's nearby Debenhams. Walsall has lost three department stores in recent years.

74,1,Biden ends summer sales ban of higher ethanol gasoline blend,622 words,Austin American-Statesman,"American drivers usually fill their tanks with E10 gas, fuel with a 10% mix of ethanol, which averages about $4.10 a gallon. E15 gas is about 10 cents less a gallon. The Environmental Protection Agency has prohibited E15 from being sold in much of the U.S. from June 1 to Sept. 15 because its use can increase smog in warm weather. The administration's decision allows the EPA to waive the restriction. Gasoline manufacturers began including ethanol, a renewable, plant-based fuel, after the Renewable Fuels Standard of 2005 required its use. Ethanol in gasoline, however, has proved a contentious issue. What is E15 gasoline? E15 gas is made with ethanol, a fuel from plant materials known as biomass, though corn is a primary source. About 98% of U.S. gasoline contains ethanol, and roughly 40% of ethanol in the U.S. is made from corn. Gasoline with ethanol comes in three blends: E10: 90% gasoline | 10% ethanol E15: 85% gasoline | 15% ethanol E85: 15% gasoline | 85% ethanol Ethanol's octane number, a measure of pressure at which it will combust, is higher than that of gasoline. However, ethanol contains about one-third less energy per gallon than gasoline. That translates to vehicles traveling 3% to 4% fewer miles per gallon on E10 and 4% to 5% fewer on E15 than on 100% gasoline. Which ethanol grades do vehicles use? While E10 can be used in most cars, E15 is more restricted. It's made for cars built in 2001 and later and for light-duty trucks and sport-utility vehicles. Flex-fuel vehicles, which can operate on gasoline and gasoline-ethanol blends, can use both E15 and E85. Will the wrong ethanol grade hurt my vehicle? E15 can damage older vehicles, those built before 2001. Ethanol is considered a corrosive element on rubber and some metals. Bankrate notes it can increase moisture in gas tanks of cars that have been parked for a time. AAA says sustained use can cause engine wear and damage fuel systems. Ethanol plants tend to be located close to biomass sources Ethanol plants are concentrated in the Midwest to be closer to corn production. Plants in other parts of the country usually receive corn by rail but can also use other feedstocks. These plants are near large cities. Why are summer sales of E5 being allowed? Prices of gasoline and other items have been rising further since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. On March 31, Biden announced the release of 180 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to bring down energy prices. That's the largest release from the reserve since it was created in 1975. Have year-round sales of E15 been tried before? In May 2019, President Donald Trump lifted restrictions on E15 sales in summer. That was intended to help grain farmers hurt by tariffs imposed by Trump on China. The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, the trade group for the oil industry, challenged the move. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reinstated the restriction in 2021, saying the EPA had exceeded its authority. In January 2022, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal by a biofuels industry group that wanted summertime sales of E15 to continue.

I am certain that the company will continue to uphold the corporate values of integrity and accountability it lived by as a long-time PSE trading participant,' PSE President Ramon S. Monzon said in his welcome message. 'I am optimistic that its experience in handling investor-clients will help CTS Global in carrying out its investor relations responsibilities and be a role model in shareholder engagement to existing and upcoming listing applicants in the Small, Medium and Emerging Board.' CTS Global was established to engage in the business of equities trading. It uses its expertise to capitalize on opportunities on a local and global scale through trading of equities listed in various stock exchanges, its documents read. Currently, the company has a pool of over 30 individual traders who manage a combined capital amounting to P550 million. The company said most of the proceeds of its IPO will be used to scale up it operations globally. 'For the past few years, the company has consistently generated profits from its assets under management but was not able to maximize its bottomline profit due to overhead expenses. As the traders scale their accounts using the existing strategy, the company's overhead expenses will stay the same, giving a promising opportunity for its operating leverage,' it said. 'For the past decade, the company maintained its capital stock at P200 million, only raising it to P500 million in the last quarter of 2019 and an additional P50 million in 2020. A further increase in capital to be deployed in the global markets is the key to CTS Global taking it to the next level.'"
800,0,"Cyberattack on News Corp, Believed Linked to China, Targeted Emails of Journalists, Others -- 3rd Update",728 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"News Corp said it notified law enforcement and hired cybersecurity firm Mandiant Inc. to support an investigation. ""Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests,"" said David Wong, vice president of incident response at Mandiant.  News Corp disclosed the hack in a securities filing Friday, saying its preliminary analysis indicates that data was taken. Representatives for the Chinese Embassy in Washington didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.  News Corp said in the memo to staff it believes the threat activity is contained. The company has been offering guidance to affected employees. ""We are committed to protecting our journalists and sources. We will not be deterred from our purpose -- to provide uniquely trusted journalism and analysis. We will continue to publish the important stories of our time,"" said Almar Latour, chief executive of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal. The company's investigation indicates that systems housing financial and customer data, including subscriber information, weren't affected, according to the securities filing and a person familiar with the matter. The investigation detected that the intrusion appeared to date to at least February 2020, according to people briefed on the matter, and scores of employees were impacted. The hackers were able to access reporters' emails and Google Docs, including drafts of articles, the people said. The company was still trying to determine which emails and documents were accessed, the people said. Reporters who were affected by the hack and were briefed on it expressed concerns to company officials about protecting their sources' identities. Law-enforcement officials and cybersecurity experts say that journalists are often high-priority targets for hackers seeking to gain intelligence on behalf of foreign governments, because they speak to sources who might have valuable or sensitive information. Powerful surveillance tools have been used against journalists and human-rights activists. U.S. authorities have accused China-based hackers for years of targeting a range of American businesses and government institutions. FBI Director Christopher Wray said this week that Beijing is running a ""massive, sophisticated hacking program that is bigger than those of every other major nation combined."" The FBI has more than 2,000 active investigations related to allegations of Chinese-government-directed theft of U.S. information or technology, Mr. Wray said. China has repeatedly denied allegations that it has carried out cyberattacks. In 2013, Chinese hackers trying to monitor news coverage of China hacked into the Journal's network, apparently aiming to spy on reporters covering China and other issues, the Journal reported. The New York Times had experienced a similar attack. At the time, a Chinese embassy spokesman condemned allegations of Chinese cyberspying and said Beijing prohibits cyberattacks. In February 2020, China revoked the press credentials of three Journal reporters based in Beijing. China's Foreign Ministry said the move was punishment for an opinion piece published by the Journal. The three journalists work for the Journal's news operation, which operates with a strict separation from the opinion staff. The following month, the Trump administration announced a personnel cap in the U.S. on four state-run Chinese media outlets. Later that March, China expelled from the country American journalists from multiple news organizations, including the Journal. In November 2021, each country agreed to ease visa restrictions for the other's reporters. The Journal was among a handful of U.S. outlets set to receive new press credentials for some staff.

437,0,Tim Roth mesmerizes and meanders in the mostly toothless movie 'Sundown',674 words,Washington Post.com,"You wouldn't know its violent character from the opening scenes of ""Sundown,"" which focus on a family of super-rich tourists vacationing at a luxury Acapulco resort. For Neil (Tim Roth), his sister Alice (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her two adolescent children (Samuel Bottomley and Albertine Kotting McMillan) ï¿½?all heirs to a prosperous English meatpacking business ï¿½?this getaway is nothing but sea and swimming, great food, guitar music, gorgeous sunsets and margaritas. All is apparently well with the world. But then an event occurs that triggers Neil (and, predictably, the recognition that this idyllic picture is all an illusion). News arrives of an emergency back home, precipitating the family's mad rush to the airport for a hasty flight home ï¿½?without Neil, as it turns out, who announces, upon arriving at the airport, that he has forgotten his passport back at the hotel. But there's a strange, zombielike quality to this protagonist's subsequent behavior, after his relatives have flown off and Neil heads not to the resort he just left, but to a seedy motel, where he proceeds to settle in, embarking on a sexual affair with a young woman (Iazua Larios) and whiling the days away drinking beer with her questionable male friends. When it becomes clear that Neil isn't all that eager to rejoin his family ï¿½?he lies to Alice when she calls, and then starts ghosting her completely, for weeks ï¿½?the question becomes: Why? Franco is clearly interested in highlighting the disparity between the opening scenes of wealth and the milieu of tawdriness and squalor in which the rest of the film is set ï¿½?as well as Neil's affectless reaction to it. When a man is gunned down in broad daylight on the beach, in a drive-by speedboat shooting, Neil stares at the bloody body with less reaction than one might have over a washed-up horseshoe crab. Is he a sociopath? Is there something wrong with him physically? (Later developments suggest that there may be.) Or is he simply a convenient symbol of the apathetic haves in Franco's allegory of the have-nots? Scenes of pigs wandering into Neil's encounters ï¿½?hallucinations, perhaps, or heavy-handed metaphors for both the slaughterhouse and obscene wealth ï¿½?add a patina of social critique, but it's generally toothless. ""Sundown"" is at its most engrossing as an individual portrait, even if its inscrutable subject is a person to whom virtually no (sane) viewer will relate. Roth is still a great and mesmerizing actor, even when he's drifting, vacantly, through a hellscape. Given his rÃ©sumÃ©, Franco seems to be commenting on class and other social divisions. The film's title could refer to the sundown of the ruling elite. Then again, it may also refer to the phenomenon of ""sundowning,"" a state of late-afternoon mental confusion common to dementia patients. Is Neil a stand-in for the one-percent, whose days may or may not be numbered? Or is he just losing his mind? Franco's director's statement calls the film at once a ""character study,"" a ""study of family dynamics"" and an ""exploration of all perspectives present in Acapulco."" But the writer-director ï¿½?or at least his film ï¿½?is a bit too diffuse for any one of those things to make much of an impact. michael.osullivan@washpost.com"

389,1,Successful children's range gives Dunelm extra bounce,460 words,The Times,"In the year to date its sales are 25 per cent higher at Â£1.19 billion, or 37 per cent higher than two years ago when the first lockdown hit and forced its shops to shut. Online sales now account for more than a third of revenues. Analysts forecast that Dunelm will report a full-year profit of Â£198 million to Â£218 million. Shares in the retailer rose 5p, or 0.47 per cent, to Â£10.65.  Dunelm started out in 1979 as a market stall in Leicester run by Bill and Jean Adderley, who sold factory seconds of curtains and soft furnishings. It now has 176 shops and 10,000 employees, with the Adderley family holding a 45 per cent stake.  Dunelm has been one of the pandemic's success stories, as its ranges of affordable furnishings have been in demand as people have spent longer than ever in their homes because of coronavirus restrictions. While some analysts believe the homewares boom will tail off as spending shifts back to leisure pursuits, the rise of flexible working has continued to provide an incentive for people to invest in their home offices.  Dunelm said that its winter sale had been popular, while it would be extending its collaboration with the Natural History Museum after ""pleasing"" numbers and customer enthusiasm.  Nick Wilkinson, chief executive, said the retailer's Summer Living range of outdoor furniture had already had strong sales. Despite rising inflationary pressures,  Dunelm said that its gross margins improved in the third quarter thanks to a lower proportion of discounted sales, and it was continuing to work closely with suppliers to mitigate rising freight and raw material costs. About 80 per cent of what Dunelm sells is own-brand products, which means it has more control over its prices. Wilkinson said: ""The resilience of the Dunelm business model and the ability of our colleagues to adapt quickly to changing circumstances give us confidence in our plans, and we remain well placed to continue to grow market share.""

773,0,Hackers breach popular online shopping platform,561 words,South China Morning Post,"Hong Kong Technology Venture Company Limited (HKTV), HKTVmallâs parent company, said on Friday it had detected âabnormal and suspicious activitiesï¿½?in its computer systems on January 26 as servers located in other Asian regions gained unauthorised access to customer information on its delivery platform. âA small portion of the 4.38 million registered customer information at HKTVmall was accessed,ï¿½?it said in a statement. âHKTV has immediately contained the event and conducted a thorough investigation. âIt has since engaged one international and one local leading cybersecurity firm on January 27, 2022 to conduct an investigation, and to further enhance HKTVmallâs robust network and system security measures in addition to the current 24-hour network security monitoring.ï¿½?It added that there was no evidence of financial loss or misuse of customer data, while credit card information and order details were untouched. HKTVmall is one of the cityâs most popular online retailers. In January, it handled nearly HK$700 million worth of purchases, processing about 47,400 orders a day on average. Based on its investigation, it concluded that the affected customer information might include names of account holders, encrypted and masked login passwords, email addresses, recipientsï¿½?names, delivery addresses and contact numbers for orders placed between December 2014 and September 2018. The date of birth, recipientsï¿½?names and email addresses for HKTVmall accounts linked to Facebook accounts and Apple ID might also have been accessed. HKTV promised it would take responsibility for any unauthorised purchases made as a result of the data breach. Vice-chairman and group CEO Ricky Wong Wai-kay apologised on behalf of the company. âWe hereby express our sincere apology to the affected customers,ï¿½?he said. âUpon discovery of such an incident, the group management, our technical department and the two cybersecurity firms made continuous efforts to investigate and strengthen system security, and will make full effort to prevent further attacks.ï¿½?The company said it had implemented measures to ensure network security and reduce vulnerabilities. It had launched a review to limit the amount of client data that would be collected and retained. It also reported the breach to police and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data. Francis Fong Po-kiu, honorary president of the Hong Kong Information Technology Federation, said although only a small portion of the information was involved, there might be tens of thousands of accounts based on the large number of customers using the platform. âAs the passwords are all encrypted, they probably will not be leaked,ï¿½?he said. âThe biggest problem is that some hackers may pose as staff from other companies and call the affected customers. By stating the customersï¿½?account names or personal information such as phone numbers and addresses, they may lure the customers into providing passwords or verification codes.ï¿½?He urged consumers to be vigilant about such calls or emails. Users should also consider changing the passwords of their accounts on the platform, Facebook or Apple ID and enabling two-step verification as a precaution, he added."
77,1,What does Weetabix owner have in mind for protein drink Ufit?,760 words,The Grocer Online,"Weetabix is thought to have paid around Â£30m for the fast-growing protein shakes business, but the deal is perhaps less notable for its size than its strategic implications. Notably, it moves Weetabix both outside the breakfast occasion and into the chilled aisle for the first time, enabling the business to benefit from the post-Covid return of impulse purchasing and convenience. Complementing ranges  Weetabix is no stranger to the ready-to-drink dairy category. Faced with long-term decline in traditional breakfast occasions before the advent of Covid and at-home working, the brand launched its On The Go range into ambient aisles in 2014. But one City observer notes Ufit âplays a subtly different role to what the Weetabix brand can doï¿½?and âcomplements rather than competesï¿½?with its existing range. âIt is an obvious way for Weetabix to complement the existing offering with something that commands shelf space in the chiller cabinet in an important area of store,ï¿½?the source says. Indeed, Weetabixâs On The Go range suffered under Covid as on-the-move breakfasting reduced markedly. Annual sales for its drinks range fell back from over Â£14m pre-Covid to around Â£10m annually, despite a 54% share of the category ï¿½?though it is understood to have returned to growth since Covid restrictions were relaxed. In contrast Ufit, which is pitched as a health-focused protein drink, fat-free and with no added sugar, saw sales continue to grow as Covid brought health concerns to the fore. Ufitâs annual retail sales rose by 33% to Â£13.1m last year [NielsenIQ 52 w/e 11 September 2021]. A Weetabix spokesperson said: âUFit complements our current On The Go range, offering a strong protein-focused product range that offers growth opportunities in different parts of the store.ï¿½?âThis is an opportunity for Weetabix to support UFitâs expansion in the fast growing high-protein shakes market both in the UK and internationally.ï¿½?Looking ahead, Ufitâs health credentials are also likely to position it as a strong beneficiary from forthcoming HFSS rules. Notably, protein drinks have become an increasingly important aspect of Postâs US business, according to another industry source, meaning the category is a natural extension of its UK business, currently built around Weetabix. Though the companies will be run separately, with Lackaâs existing management team remaining in place, the deal points to Postâs UK strategy of using Weetabixâs significant market presence as a beachhead for expansion into adjacent categories. âThis may signal further ambitions from Weetabix on the acquisition trail,ï¿½?the City source notes. âPostâs strategy is to grow by acquisition, so Iâd expect more from them.ï¿½?It is understood Post has been involved in processes for significantly bigger-ticket UK-focused branded companies, also outside the cereal aisle. Further diversification would no doubt bolster Weetabix, which has struggled for consistent growth since its acquisition by Post as a result of the challenges in the cereal category. Under Post, revenues at Weetabix UK did not recover to their 2016 pre-acquisition levels of Â£313m until 2019. And while they rose to Â£331m in 2020 as Covid lockdowns boosted the performance of more traditional breakfast brands, the challenge for Weetabix is to replicate this upturn in trading as consumer behaviour returns to pre-Covid normality. Postâs latest first quarter results from the US show Weetabix volumes declined 4.4% in the first three months of 2022 against tough Covid-driven comparisons of the previous year, though it remains the UKâs biggest breakfast brands with domestic sales of over Â£250m. So Ufit ï¿½?which is already available across the mainstream grocers ï¿½?is likely to become an important growth engine for the group in the UK. Austin Bailey, founder and MD of Lacka Foods, called the deal âa transformational step in the Lacka Foods storyï¿½?to supercharge its growth in the UK and internationally. And all the signs suggest Postâs ambitions in the UK will not be limited to this one high-growth addition."
875,0,Beer boss is accused of intimidating staff,434 words,The Times,"Watt, 39, took to an internal forum for investors to suggest that sources for the show could regret co-operating. ""All of this is very, very likely to end up in court,"" he said. Watt suggested that the BBC was likely to have told sources that their identity would remain confidential but that ""can never be guaranteed"". In a separate post shared widely on social media, he says the company is ""very concerned about the BBC's sources"" because many people it had spoken to left for disciplinary reasons and had ""an obvious axe to grind"". Some were dismissed for theft, poor performance, being intoxicated, abusing others, health and safety breaches and endangering colleagues, Watt said. He added: ""For the BBC to use a source who was dismissed, for instance, for theft and not cite that fact is neither fair nor responsible journalism."" Watt has been fighting to restore the company's reputation after dozens of staff, under the collective name of Punks with Purpose, signed an open letter in June alleging ""toxic attitudes towards junior staff"" and a culture of fear that had left many ""burnt out, afraid and miserable"". Bryan Simpson, of Unite Hospitality, said: ""Perhaps if Mr Watt had spent more time and resources over the last six months trying to resolve the issues instead of trying to discredit whistleblowers then there wouldn't have been a need for workers to speak out as part of the BBC documentary."" In a statement released yesterday Watt said hackers had made attempts to access his personal email last year. He said: ""The BBC appears to have acquired personal information that is entirely confidential and it's clearly a concern that [it] has been passed information that may well have come from that illegal hacking, or information that was otherwise illegally obtained. ""We also know false information has been given to the BBC, which, if broadcast, would be highly defamatory."" Watt has previously described appearing on the BBC show Who's the Boss? as one of his biggest mistakes and said it was ""a complete hatchet job"". Watt and his friend Martin Dickie, also 39, started BrewDog in 2007. Disclosure: The Truth About BrewDog is being shown on BBC1 on Monday."

The BBC said it had âconsidered the implicationsï¿½?of the law and that after âcareful deliberationï¿½?it would continue English language reporting from Tuesday evening. In a statement, the BBC said: âWe have considered the implications of the new legislation alongside the urgent need to report from inside Russia. After careful deliberation we have decided to resume English language reporting from Russia this evening, after it was temporarily suspended at the end of last week. âWe will tell this crucial part of the story independently and impartially, adhering to the BBCâs strict editorial standards. The safety of our staff in Russia remains our No 1 priority.ï¿½?The broadcaster paused the work of all its news journalists and support staff in Russia after the Russian Duma approved the law cracking down on foreign outlets [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/04/bbc-temporarily-suspending-work-all-news-journalists-russia]. A number of media groups removed their staff from Russia as a result, with the new law essentially threatening to punish independent journalism with prison sentences of up to 15 years. The BBCâs director general, Tim Davie, previously said the new law appeared to âcriminalise the process of independent journalismï¿½?in the country.  Vladimir Putinâs foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, had accused the BBC of playing a âdetermined role in undermining the Russian stability and securityï¿½?over its reporting on Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine [https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/08/ukraine-news-russia-war-vladimir-putin-volodymyr-zelenskiy-kyiv-russian-invasion-live-latest-updates]. On Friday, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Bloomberg News said their journalists had also stopped working. CNN and CBS News said they would stop broadcasting in Russia and other outlets removed Russian-based journalistsï¿½?bylines as they assessed the situation. Russian officials have repeatedly said false information had been spread by the US and its western European allies in an attempt to sow discord among the Russian people. The new legislation was drafted by Russiaâs upper house of parliament and signed into law by Putin, the state-run news agency Tass reported. âThis law will force punishment ï¿½?and very tough punishment ï¿½?on those who lied and made statements which discredited our armed forces,ï¿½?the chair of the Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, said.

654,0,"Facebook-owner Meta says Ukraine's military, politicians targeted in hacking campaign",631 words,Reuters News,"Meta said in the last 48 hours it had also separately removed a network of about 40 fake accounts, groups and pages across Facebook and Instagram that operated from Russia and Ukraine targeting people in Ukraine, for violating its rules against coordinated inauthentic behavior.  A Twitter spokesperson said it had also suspended more than a dozen accounts and blocked the sharing of several links for violating its rules against platform manipulation and spam. It said its ongoing investigation indicated the accounts originated in Russia and were attempting to disrupt the public conversation around the conflict in Ukraine.  In a blog post on Monday, Meta attributed the hacking efforts to a group known as Ghostwriter, which it said successfully gained access to the targets' social media accounts. Meta said the hackers attempted to post YouTube videos from the accounts portraying Ukrainian troops as weakened, including one video which claimed to show Ukrainian soldiers coming out of a forest and flying a white flag of surrender.  Ukrainian cybersecurity officials said on Friday that hackers from neighboring Belarus were targeting the private email addresses of Ukrainian military personnel ""and related individuals,"" blaming a group code-named ""UNC1151."" The U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye has previously connected the group with Ghostwriter activities.  Meta's security team said it had taken steps to secure targeted accounts and had blocked the phishing domains used by the hackers. It declined to give the names of any of the targets but said it had alerted users where possible.  Meta said the separate influence campaign, which used a number of fictitious personas, claimed to be based in Kyiv and ran a small number of websites masquerading as independent news outlets. These outlets published claims about the West betraying Ukraine and Ukraine being a failed state.  The company said it had found links between this influence network and an operation it removed in April 2020, which it had connected to individuals in Russia, the Donbass region in Ukraine and two media outlets based in Crimea.  Meta declined to give a number of impressions or views for the influence campaign's content but said it had seen a ""very low level"" of shares, posts or reactions. It said the campaign had fewer than 4,000 Facebook accounts following one of more of its pages and fewer than 500 accounts following one or more of its Instagram accounts. It did not say how long the campaigns had been active on its platforms.  It said the campaign had also used Alphabet Inc's YouTube, Telegram and Russian social media sites Odnoklassniki and VK. YouTube, Telegram, Odnoklassniki and VK did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The crisis in Ukraine has seen escalating clashes between Moscow and major tech companies. On Friday, Russia said it would partially restrict access to Facebook, a move Meta said came after it refused a government request to stop the independent fact-checking of several Russian state media outlets. On Saturday, Twitter also said its service was being restricted for some Russian users.  Ukraine's health ministry said on Sunday that more than 300 children, had been killed since the beginning of the invasion.  Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""  Ukraine has been buffeted by digital intrusions and denial-of-service actions both in the run-up to and during the Russian invasion. Several big tech companies have announced measures to bolster the security and privacy of their users in the country."

This was followed with a whopping US$58 million income in 2020, mostly coming from his Netflix film Spenser Confidential that became a sleeper hit on the streaming platform. If we know anything about Marky Mark (formerly of the Funky Bunch, his pre-acting stage name) itâs that he is the epitome of living life in the fast lane. From expensive supercars to luxurious timepieces, he loves to splash his cash as much as he works hard for it. Here we take a look inside the starâs crazy rich life. According to GQ, the 50-year-old star has an array of sports cars at his disposal including a Lamborghini Diablo VT Roadster, Bentley Azure T and Porsche Panamera ï¿½?all part of his US$2 million car collection. For a family outing, he opts for the Toyota Sienna. He described it as the âMintmobileâï¿½?on The Ellen DeGeneres Show due to the endless supply of mints he saved in there. Wahlbergâs passion for cars started when he used to work as a mechanic as a teenager, and now all grown up the Max Payne actor once reportedly shelled out more than half a million dollars for his distinctive 2014 Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe, complete with two-tone colour scheme and rear-hinged doors. From Patek Phillipe to Rolexes, The Italian Job star sure loves his exquisite timepieces. According to the DâMarge website, the actor owns dozens of Rolexes and is often the first person to receive hot new products straight from the watchmaker. Meanwhile, his Patek Philippe Reference 6002 Sky Moon Tourbillon ï¿½?the brandâs most complicated watch ï¿½?has a 44mm case in rose gold with 12 complications and a front dial that combines Grand Feu champlevÃ© and cloisonnÃ© enamelling.

It features 11 bedrooms, 18 bathrooms, a full-size basketball court, pool, wine cellar, spa and golf putting green. The spacious backyard is enveloped with lush greens while the interior shows coffered ceilings, limestone floors and a fireplace. But Wahlbergâs prized room is, of course, his state-of-the-art gym filled with every fitness equipment piece one can think of: stacks of dumbbells, cardio machines, and many more fearsome-looking contraptions. During the 2020 quarantine, Wahlberg treated fans to a sneak peek inside his French palace-inspired home, sharing a throng of videos and pictures of his wife Rhea Durham and their four adorable children. The family moved into their purpose-built mansion in 2013 after selling his previous seven-bedroom, 10-bathroom estate, which went for more than US$12 million. While he loves his fast cars and Swiss luxury watches, Wahlberg is also a fashionista. He has often sported head-to-toe Louis Vuitton during his public appearances, but his most enthusiast collection is definitely his Air Jordan trainers. According to People, The Departed actor had well over 100 pairs of kicks, which were valued at around US$100,000 in 2015. At a Boston Celtics game in 2020, his young son Brendan sported a pair of the rare Air Jordan IV Wahlburgers trainers ï¿½?an exclusive collaboration between the actorâs restaurant chain and the Jordan brand in 2018. When youâre Mark Wahlberg, there is no other way to quarantine but like a king.

The house came with a US$400,000 fortnightly price tag, round-the-clock security team and a private ambulance on standby.

91,0,India may become popular holiday destination for Russians after Europe closes - ambassador,342 words,World Service Wire,"""I am sure that in the future India will not only be able to receive the maximum number of Russian tourists, but would also be very interested in this. Unfortunately, Aeroflot regular flights have been suspended for the time being. This is a common situation for all countries at this stage. But Air India operates flights between Moscow and Delhi. In the near future, their number will be increased. The only thing that can somehow be an obstacle is the restriction of money transfers, the use of credit cards abroad, but I think that in this case a solution will be found in the near future,"" Alipov said. Indians are warmly disposed towards Russia The diplomat added that the Indians, both now and before, are warmly disposed towards Russia, despite the negative information background, which prevails in the country. ""Unfortunately, in the Indian information space, a serious position is occupied by Western content, which is broadcast here. But at the same time, not only among ordinary Indians, but also among experts and political analysts who are closely following the development of the situation and commenting on it, there are many who perfectly understands all the circumstances of the current aggravation of the situation and the reasons that led to it,"" Alipov said. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on February 24 that in response to a request by the heads of the Donbass republics he had made a decision to carry out a special military operation in Ukraine, stressing that Moscow had no plans of occupying Ukrainian territories. Western countries responded to the actions of the Russian authorities by slapping sanctions against physical and legal entities."

244,0,"Sunwing deal is just the first as hospitality sector faces consolidation pressures; Tour operatorâs financial challenges mirror what is playing out for owners of hotels, restaurants, gyms, ski hills and all sorts of other privately held businesses",842 words,The Globe and Mail (Breaking News),"As this year began, the tour operator faced repaying $327-million in federal government loans. At the same time, vacation travel was taking off and Sunwing needed to spend money to lease aircraft and rehire pilots and flight attendants. Mr. Hunter said the conflicting pressures of paying down debt while needing to put more capital into expanding the company prompted Sunwing to revisit prepandemic overtures from WestJet Group and agree to sell the business his family launched in 2002. âWe got to the point, in the last few years, where we couldnât grow as much as we wanted to grow,ï¿½?Mr. Hunter said in an interview. He said Sunwing was looking at options for dealing with the seasonality of its business ï¿½?its fleet goes from 40 aircraft in the winter to 15 in the summer ï¿½?before the pandemic burdened the company with debt. He said tapping the market reach and financial strength of WestJet and parent Onex Corp. âhelps get us over this hump.ï¿½?Sunwingâs financial challenges mirror what is playing out for owners of hotels, restaurants, gyms, ski hills and all sorts of other privately held businesses hit by the pandemic. If they survived the past two years, they did so by slashing costs, burning through savings and borrowing money. Now these entrepreneurs ï¿½?the hospitality sector is dominated by family-owned businesses ï¿½?face the challenge of rebuilding their operations while paying down debt. Sunwingâs owners are in the fortunate position of having a deep-pocketed buyer. Other companies facing the same headwinds are going out of business. Toronto-based Sky Regional Airlines Inc. shut down last March, ending a decade-long run. Mr. Hunterâs family and Sunwing minority shareholder TUI Group, a German tour operator with a 49-per-cent stake, will take WestJet shares in exchange for their business. The Hunter family and TUI will continue to own a collection of 30 hotels in the tropics.  Federal regulator launches formal probe into Flair Airlinesï¿½?compliance with Canadian ownership laws[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-federal-regulator-launches-formal-probe-into-flair-airlines-compliance/] WestJet set to buy vacation airline Sunwing[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-westjet-set-to-buy-vacation-airline-sunwing/]  Sunwing is a private company but did disclose that it borrowed $227.1-million under a federal government loan program and drew an additional $99.6-million from a credit facility. This was expensive capital. The debt carried a 5-per-cent interest rate, and Mr. Hunter said that, as a private company, Sunwing was also forced to pay an additional 6 per cent for credit insurance. âWith or without this deal, we were looking to repay that financing,ï¿½?he said. âThis will turn out to be a good investment for Canadian taxpayers.ï¿½? WestJet is unique among Canadian airlines for turning down government funding during the pandemic, a decision that Mr. Hunter said made the Calgary-based airline a more attractive partner. WestJet and Sunwing declined comment on the value of the transaction. Toronto-based Onex acquired WestJet in 2019 for $5-billion, including assumed debt. Onexâs financial results, released last Friday, show it funded the takeover with US$980-million of equity. Of that total, US$196-million came from Onex, with the remainder coming from its institutional investor clients.  Onexâs results show that, despite the pandemic, the company received US$3-million in cash distributions from WestJet over the past two years.  WestJet chief executive Alexis von Hoensbroech, who took the top job less than two weeks ago after serving as CEO at Austrian Airlines, said combining the two companies will be a win for consumers and will mean more jobs in Canada, âas you combine Sunwing, a large tour operator with a small airline, with WestJet, a large airline thatâs a small tour operator.ï¿½?Once Sunwing joins the fold, WestJet plans to expand a tour business that was focused on Florida, the Caribbean and Mexico to destinations the Calgary-based airline already serves, such as Arizona, California, Hawaii and Europe. WestJetâs advisers on the transaction are investment bank Barclays and law firm Goodmans LLP. The takeover requires regulatory approval ï¿½?a process that helped scuttle Air Canadaâs proposed acquisition of Transat AT Inc. last April ï¿½?and is expected to close by the end of the year.

524,0,Hong Kong hamster massacre: Residents resist 'zero covid' city's pet project,1115 words,Washington Post.com,"But when the government announced a cull of 2,000 pet hamsters, a line was crossed. The rodents could carry the coronavirus, officials said, and transmit it to humans. Now, an underground operation is trying to save abandoned hamsters, with foster caregivers taking them in and concealing them. Pet owners are in an uproar over the government's plan to kill the hamsters, which experts say is rooted in knee-jerk panic rather than science. The hamsters are casualties of Hong Kong's ""zero covid"" policy, which many here see as a futile political quest. Resistance groups have assembled on the Telegram messaging app to share updates, drawing on methods used in anti-government protests in 2019. Nearly 3,000 people have volunteered to house the affected hamsters. On social media, concerned residents have shared photos of abandoned hamsters in the hope of enlisting rescuers. Many garnered responses in seconds. The furor erupted when the government said Tuesday that hamsters purchased from pet shops after Dec. 22 were potentially infected with the virus ï¿½?after several imported from the Netherlands tested positive. Authorities ""strongly recommended"" that pet owners surrender hamsters to their fate. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department has begun to cull small animals from the Little Boss pet store, where the infected hamsters were found after a 23-year-old worker tested positive. The hamsters ""can infect other animals, other hamsters and human beings,"" Thomas Sit, assistant director of the department and a veterinarian, said at a news conference Tuesday. ""We have to protect public health, and we have no choice."" For many pet owners, the response was a resounding ""no."" Alice, 36, said she would never turn in Siu Ding, purchased from Little Boss for her 6-year-old daughter after the cutoff date. She spoke on the condition that only her first name be used, for fear that the authorities could trace the pet. ""Their sins are too deep,"" she said, referring to the government as she held back tears. ""I don't want my hamster killed."" Experts have questioned the merits of the policy. Guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is ""no evidence"" that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus. The City University of Hong Kong's Center for Animal Health and Welfare said the risk of contracting the virus from pets is ""negligible."" The hamsters could be ""innocent bystanders,"" said veterinarian Lawren Durocher-Babek. The government is moving too quickly with the cull, she said, leaving owners struggling to make decisions about the level of risk with no data available. ""There are way too many unknowns to definitively blame hamsters,"" she said. The government has no legal means to force owners to give up their pets, and authorities say there will be no criminal consequences for noncompliance. But some are pushing for stronger action. On Wednesday, lawmaker Michael Tien said a mandate to round up hamsters is necessary as long as there is a risk that they could spread the virus. ""To 'strongly recommend' people to turn in their hamsters is neither fish nor fowl,"" he said. ""There could be drastic consequences."" Hamster supporters are mobilizing in creative ways. One, who is skilled in Photoshop, has offered to amend hamster purchase receipts to indicate the pets were bought before Dec. 22. For some hamsters, it is too late. Convinced by the government or prompted by panic, some families have begun surrendering their furry friends. A boy was seen bawling in a video recorded by local TV channel i-Cable News, saying amid sobs that he didn't want his hamster to go, while taking pictures of their last moments together before his father turned in the doomed animal. At the agriculture department's entrance, a local media outlet interviewed a man who had relinquished his hamster, fearing that the government could trace him to the pet shop via credit card records. Another told reporters that ""the government only wants what's best for citizens."" Volunteers have tried to intercept owners heading to hand over their hamsters, offering to take the animals into their care instead. On Friday, the department warned that if the ""people concerned continue with such action,"" officials would report them to the police. If the authorities come for Siu Ding, Alice said, she will stash the pudding dwarf hamster at a friend's place. ""If, say, horses and dogs are the ones infected, would you decide to kill them all?"" she said. A woman with the last name Yuen, 36, said her mother asked her to dump her hamster, Bao Bao, onto the streets. ""I told my mother, 'I won't throw you out if anything happens to you, as you are my family. Same goes for my hamster; it is my family,' "" she said, withholding her full name out of security concerns. Animal rights groups say the authorities failed to take into account animal-to-human bonds or consider alternative policies, such as testing the hamsters. Poor messaging has led to panic, said Sophia Chan of Life on Palm, a hamster concern group. Chan has been inundated with messages from hamster owners, many of whom face family pressure to abandon their pets. Her apartment has become a safe house for several dozen hamsters she is fostering ï¿½?not all of them purchased after Dec. 22. The group has received close to 100 abandoned hamsters, Chan said. One woman called in tears after her family threw away her hamster without asking. She rummaged through the trash, but her pet was nowhere to be seen. Despite the outrage, authorities have continued with the hamster slaughter. On Wednesday, officials in full-body protective gear were seen holding medical bags retrieved from pet shops and loading them into vehicles. That same day, 1,213 small animals, including hamsters, rabbits, guinea pigs and chinchillas, were euthanized, according to the agriculture department.

20,0,Soufi's restaurant closes its doors permanently,547 words,The Toronto Star,"A family-run restaurant at Queen Street West and Bathurst Street, Soufi's opened its doors in 2017, bringing Syrian cuisine to Toronto. Its last day was Sunday. ""Our mom has been sick for a year and a half. We tried to make it through the pandemic but with the no-mask rule, it's too risky,"" said Alaa Alsoufi on Sunday. ""Plus, we're tired, we need to breathe a bit."" Mask mandates were dropped in most circumstances provincewide in late March, relieving some pressure on small businesses. But for the Alsoufi family, it made for a well-ordered exit. ""We were actually trying to reach this point, we wanted this to happen in the turning point, not when things were less certain. We were just trying to at least reach this point, it's been hard,"" Alaa said. Founded by the Alsoufi family, the Toronto eatery has been praised as a refugee resettlement program success story. After arriving in Canada, the Alsoufis noticed there wasn't much in terms of Syrian food throughout the city, prompting them to start their own restaurant. Missing from Toronto's kaleidoscopic cuisine were knafeh and maneesh. So the family decided to fill that gap, much to their customers' delight. ""This was a wonderful place, the food is delicious, the owners are lovely people,"" said Akash Swar, a customer who's patronized Soufi's since it first opened. ""It was really nice to have this community here and have the city get introduced to Syrian food. This is something I grew up eating back in Dubai, so its close to my heart."" ""I'm happy that they had that opportunity to share their culture and food with people here because I feel like Toronto is such a diverse city and it gives you that opportunity to explore your options and put something new out there."" Another customer, Josh Chernofsky, lamented the changing nature of Toronto's streets as businesses like Soufi's close. ""It seems Queen Street and a lot of streets in general are losing their character and it includes the loss of this,"" Chernofsky said. ""Nothing seems to be changing for the better in the city."" Although Soufi's is closing, Alaa points out there are other Syrian restaurants sprouting up in and around the GTA. ""There's a bunch of different places, mostly in Mississauga, and there is one on Yonge and Eglinton."" The restaurant has made headlines in the past. In 2019, Soufi's closed temporarily after their son was a target for death threats following a political protest. Now that Soufi's is closing on its own terms, Jala Alsoufi considers it a bittersweet moment. ""This is a project me and my family worked on really hard for five years, but now we want to focus a bit more on our family,"" Jala said. ""To take care of each other and we're really happy with what we've done. ""We're proud of this. We're proud of this space and we love our customers. It's just time for us to close."""
258,0,"Williamsburg Hotel's Owners Siphoned Off Cash, Bankruptcy Examiner Says; The Brooklyn hotel's developers deny the allegations, saying the examiner spun a false narrative to run up fees",914 words,The Wall Street Journal Online,"The examiner, Eric Huebscher, determined the developers ""controlled both sides of the accounting ledger, preventing open disclosure of financial and accounting transactions, and allowing for the siphoning of funds"" from the hotel to ""unrelated investments."" The hotel's owner said in court papers Monday the report is ""full of mischaracterizations, false statements, and outright defamatory and baseless conclusions"" and was developed in close coordination with the hotel's secured mortgage lender, Benefit Street Partners LLC. The examiner identified an aggregate $12.5 million sent from the management company to other entities connected with Ms. Moskovits and Mr. Lichtenstein, as well as other legally questionable transactions, according to the report, filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y. The report ""creates a false narrative, and is replete with deliberate misstatements, false claims and conclusions, in spite and in the face of evidence and facts that have proven such claims to be false,"" according to the hotel's owner, 96 Wythe Acquisition LLC. The report will influence the hotel's ongoing efforts to exit chapter 11 under a restructuring plan backed by Ms. Moskovits' and Mr. Lichtenstein's Heritage Equity Partners but opposed by Benefit Street. The hotel stopped paying interest in 2018 on its mortgage loan, which matured in 2019 without repayment before the hotel filed for chapter 11 protection last year to avoid foreclosure. Mr. Lichtenstein said in a declaration filed Monday that Mr. Huebscher misused his position to act as a ""passionate advocate"" for Benefit Street's claims and positions and was in ""almost daily contact"" with the lender's lawyers. A bankruptcy judge appointed Mr. Huebscher to conduct an outside examination in November after the lender raised allegations [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/williamsburg-hotels-top-lender-challenges-chapter-11-exit-plan-11642552221] that Ms. Moskovits and Mr. Lichtenstein had diverted revenue and other funds from the hotel to affiliated entities under the developers' control. Mr. Lichtenstein said on Monday the examiner had needlessly expanded the scope of his investigation to run up fees and aid the lender in its efforts to derail the planned restructuring. The developers' plan would force Benefit Street to accept a new, borrower-friendly $70.7 million loan [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/williamsburg-hotel-pushes-for-interest-rate-cut-on-top-lender-11644963960] with lower interest rates than the current mortgage. The lender has said it is owed $95 million including interest and fees and is entitled to a higher coupon on any replacement loan, which the hotel disputes. Lawyers for Benefit Street didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. In court papers, the hotel said that transactions identified in the report as suspect were legitimate payments for covering the hotel's operating or construction expenses, repaying loans owed to third parties or reimbursing business expenditures and short-term loans by the hotel's principals or affiliates. The examiner was provided with ""more than enough information to establish the foregoing,"" according to the owner's filing, which said the report also failed to mention the roughly $21 million in equity and $11 million in loans infused into the hotel. Mr. Lichtenstein separately said the examiner had ignored inflows of money, double-counted certain transfers and erroneously claimed the business had transferred more funds than it had generated from 2017 to 2020, a ""practical impossibility."" Mr. Huebscher has sought court approval to increase the fee cap on his investigation from $350,000 to $850,000, saying the investigation cost more than expected because Ms. Moskovits and Mr. Lichtenstein failed to turn over bank statements, interfered in subpoenas issued to third parties and failed to answer questions about thousands of transactions. The owner asked on Monday to enforce the fee cap, saying the examiner's fees are disproportionate to the size of the bankruptcy case and the result of his arbitrarily expanding the scope of the probe and looking at unrelated bank accounts. Monday's report found the hotel didn't file tax returns from 2017 to 2019, even though about $24.5 million was deposited into its bank accounts from 2017 to 2020. Similarly, about $68 million was deposited into the developer-controlled hotel manager's account, but with the exception of 2019, those deposits weren't reported to any taxing authority, the report said. In response, Mr. Lichtenstein told the examiner that additional tax returns weren't filed because the entities didn't make a profit, according to the report. Mr. Lichtenstein said Monday that the hotel's tax filings have been brought up to date. Ms. Moskovits and Mr. Lichtenstein have proposed injecting $10 million into the hotel under a bankruptcy-exit plan that would retain their equity interests in the business. A court hearing to consider the restructuring has been pushed back to April from March to accommodate mediation talks with Benefit Street.

UnitedHealth said it expects full-year earnings to be between $20.30 a share and $20.80 a share, up from its previously issued guidance[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/unitedhealth-logged-steady-revenue-growth-to-close-2021-11642594464?mod=article_inline] of $20.20 a share to $20.70 a share. Adjusted earnings for the year are now expected to be between $21.20 a share and $21.70 a share, up from $21.10 a share to $21.60 a share. Throughout the pandemic, at times when Covid-19 cases have surged[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/coronavirus-case-count-11594333471?mod=article_inline], the company has seen levels of usual healthcare, like colonoscopies and joint replacements, fall off in tandem. Over the first quarter, hospitalizations due to Covid-19 dropped sharply, to around 2,000 in March compared with about 40,000 in January, while most types of healthcare were at normal levels. So far, UnitedHealth isn't seeing problems due to care put off or canceled during the pandemic, including no uptick in cancer-related diagnoses. Health screenings are happening at normal levels, the company said.  UnitedHealth said it was on track to meet its goal of enrolling 800,000 new people in its Medicare Advantage products in 2022. The company said Optum now expects to add 600,000 customers this year to its tally of patients getting care under capitated arrangements, which typically involve paying doctors set amounts, rather than fees for each service. UnitedHealth has highlighted its expansion of capitation as a key initiative and previously projected it would add 500,000 capitated lives this year.  UnitedHealth also signaled it would continue its aggressive strategy toward acquisitions, highlighted by the recent announcement that it plans to buy home-care company LHC Group[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/unitedhealth-to-buy-home-health-firm-lhc-group-for-5-4-billion-11648550701] Inc.

Net income attributable to shareholders for the first quarter of 2022 was $5.03 billion, or $5.27 a share, up from $4.86 billion, or $5.08 a share, a year ago. Revenue for the quarter rose more than 14% to $80.15 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected revenue of $78.73 million. The company's profit, stripped of amortization and tax effects, was $5.49 a share. Analysts had been expecting adjusted earnings of $5.36 a share, according to FactSet's survey. The medical-loss ratio, a closely watched measure of the proportion of premiums going to medical care, was 82%, below analysts' expectations. The company's UnitedHealthcare insurance business saw revenue grow 13.6% in the first quarter to $62.6 billion. The business added 350,000 members in the latest quarter, with growth in programs tied to government benefits, such as Medicare Advantage and Dual Special Needs Plans, leading the increase. Prescriptions filled by OptumRx, the company's pharmacy-benefits division, grew to 352 million in the quarter, compared with 329 million in the same quarter last year.

829,0,How Hackers May Have Gotten an Early Look at Earnings Releases -- Barrons.com,1660 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"It's one of the largest hackings of inside information on stocks ever charged, and the case is likely to shine an uncomfortable light on an obscure but crucial industry that handles the market's most-sensitive information. Charging documents from the Department of Justice, and a parallel civil case by the SEC, conceal the names of the two filing services. The SEC complaint describes ""Servicer A"" as a Chicago-based company, and ""Servicer B"" as a division of a foreign company. Barron's was able to determine that Servicer A is Chicago-based Donnelley Financial Solutions (DFIN), while Servicer B is the Toppan Merrill unit of Japan's Toppan (TOPPY). That's because the SEC's public archive, known as Edgar, has digital copies of the earnings announcements mentioned in the criminal case, and each filing names the responsible filing service. Federal prosecutors in Boston allege that the Klyushin group stole computer passwords from the filing agents' employees and then roamed the firms' networks from 2017 through 2020 to steal copies of more than 500 unannounced earnings drafts. After his arrest in Switzerland and extradition to Boston, Klyushin pleaded not guilty at his Jan. 8 arraignment before U.S. Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler. The judge declined to release him on bail. His co-defendants remain at large and aren't represented in court. Toppan Merrill acknowledged to Barron's that it is one of the filing agents described in the indictments of the hacking ring. ""Toppan Merrill has been cooperating fully with government authorities in support of their investigations in this matter,"" the company's general counsel Lisa Bilcik wrote in an email. ""We have communicated with the limited set of customers whose information was allegedly accessed and used in the illegal trading scheme."" Toppan Merrill declined to comment further. Donnelley Financial did not respond to repeated requests for comment, and it has never publicly spoken about the hacking cases. Its website, DFIN -- as Donnelley Financial now styles itself -- tells potential customers that its ActiveDisclosure system is secure. ""Unsurpassed security gives you peace of mind,"" says the website. ""At DFIN, we successfully handle some of the most sensitive documents in the world thanks to our best-in-class security architecture and fraud detection solutions."" Donnelley Financial and Toppan Merrill are remnants of a once-thriving financial printing industry, relied upon by Wall Street to confidentially prepare the prospectuses, proxies, and sensitive announcements of public companies. As ink and paper gave way to electronic files, financial printers evolved into software suppliers hired by public companies and investment funds to securely format and submit the SEC filings that contain some of the most actionable trading information on the planet. The Donnelley Financial business was spun off in 2016 from R.R. Donnelley & Sons (RRD) -- the 150-year-old Chicago firm that had been America's largest printer, producing catalogs for Sears Roebuck and magazines for Time Inc. The first-known infiltration of the filing agent's systems was in October 2017, according to prosecutors: a year after Donnelley Financial first traded on the New York Stock Exchange for $28 a share. Nearly every public company now uses the software systems of three firms: Donnelley Financial, Toppan Merrill, or the Ames, Iowa--based Workiva (WK). At Workiva, the filing firm that wasn't involved with the alleged hacks, its chief information security officer, Eric Anders, expressed sympathy for his rivals. ""Let's be clear,"" he blogged, after the unsealing of the hacking case, ""[N]o company is completely immune to attack, and anyone who promises otherwise is lying."" In a March 2021 affidavit filed by prosecutors to obtain Klyushin's arrest warrant, Federal Bureau of Investigation agent B.J. Kang alleged that the hacking group penetrated one of the filing agents in November 2018, and used inside information to buy or sell short shares of its clients, including IBM, Avnet (AVT), Steel Dynamics (STLD) and 3M (MMM). Public filings at the SEC show that those firms were clients of Toppan Merrill. Infiltration of the second filing agent began in 2017, Kang alleged, allowing the conspirators to trade ahead of the announcements of a long list of that filing service's customers, which included Tesla, Grubhub, Nielsen Holdings (NLSN), Kohl's (KSS), Hexcel (HXL), Roku (ROKU), HubSpot (HUBS), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), and Snap (SNAP). The SEC Edgar database shows that Donnelley Financial was the filing agent for those companies, and dozens of others mentioned in the FBI affidavit. Barron's queried the public companies whose announcements were alleged to have been stolen. Only Nielsen Holdings would comment, saying that the charges unsealed in December were its first notice of the alleged inside trading. Nielsen says it has asked for more information from its filing agent, Donnelley Financial. One of the four co-defendants alleged to have carried out the intrusions, Ivan Yermakov (or ""Ermakov""), worked for Klyushin's Moscow-based cybersecurity firm, M-13, prosecutors say. The 35-year-old Yermakov, they say, is a veteran of the Russian military intelligence agency known by the initials GRU. While at GRU, according to a 2018 federal indictment, Yermakov infiltrated the computers of the Democratic Party and the campaign of Hillary Clinton, ahead of the 2016 elections. A second indictment in 2018 charged him with hacking antidoping agencies, sports federations, and antidoping officials, as well as the nuclear reactor unit of Westinghouse Electric, the international agency against chemical weapons, and a lab that had investigated suspected Russian poisonings in the United Kingdom. Yermakov remains at large, and no charges were lodged against M-13. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Yermakov in 2018 for his alleged hacking of the 2016 election, and an FBI wanted poster seeks him for the election and sports-doping-related allegations. No attorney has appeared for him in any of the U.S. proceedings, including the recent stock trading cases. Yermakov appears never to have commented publicly on his U.S. indictments, and his social media accounts were closed down after the first case filings. The M-13 cybersecurity firm where Klyushin employed Yermakov is hired by its clients to attempt computer attacks in an exercise known as penetration testing, according to its website. The website listed clients that include Russian government agencies and the office of President Vladimir Putin. In June 2020, Putin awarded Klyushin a national medal of honor. M-13 did not respond to requests for comment. Klyushin's activities have left him well off, say prosecutors. In arguing that he posed a flight risk if released on bail, prosecutors presented photos they say Klyushin sent Yermakov, showing a safe with an estimated $3 million in $100 bills. Klyushin has a $2 million London apartment and a $4 million yacht, according to court filings. The attorney representing Klyushin in the federal criminal case did not respond to queries. Letters to Judge Bowler, purporting to come from Klyushin's employees, praised Klyushin's fairness and generosity, saying that he paid their medical bills and took them on retreats to resorts like the Russian city of Sochi. He paid to repair the roof of Moscow's Sretensky Monastery, said one writer, and loved pets and nature. ""I can't imagine a situation in which Vladislav could hurt someone or wish evil,"" wrote his second wife, Zhannetta Kliushina. ""Vladislav cannot commit what he is accused of."" Previous criminal cases have charged overseas hackers with stealing advance knowledge of market-moving information from public relations newswires, the SEC itself, or from merger-and-acquisition lawyers. Only the illicit gains alleged in the newswires case exceeded the $82.5 million that Klyushin and his co-defendants are charged with reaping. According to the latest federal charges, Yermakov stole log-in credentials from employees of the two filing agents and installed malware that allowed him to query their networks from over 100 rotating, anonymous internet addresses associated with locations around the world. He had bought and established the fictitious addresses using cryptocurrency to cover his tracks, say prosecutors. Klyushin and others allegedly traded on the stolen information in the hours and days before the announcements became public. A statistical analysis by the SEC claims that the probability that the group would have traded as it did around the companies' earnings--by chance alone--is one in a trillion. In prosecutors' filings, they cite an array of evidence that includes photos and text messages exchanged by Klyushin, Yermakov, and their associates, as well as trading records from Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR) and brokers in the U.K., Denmark, Russia, Cyprus, and Portugal. None of the brokers have been accused of wrongdoing. In a June 2020 exchange of texts, prosecutors say, Yermakov told Klyushin that they needed to go to work to make money to buy an apartment. Klyushin responded that there was no need to do that, because they just had to ""turn on the computer"" to make money, according to prosecutors. 1 Feb 2022 02:59 ET How Hackers May Have Gotten an Early Look at -2- Write to Bill Alpert at william.alpert@barrons.com, (END) Dow Jones Newswires February 01, 2022 02:59 ET (07:59 GMT)"
734,1,Ericsson reports first quarter results 2022,1560 words,Communications Today,"EBIT amounted to SEK 5.9 b. with an EBIT margin of 10.7% when excluding the provision and a revaluation of Ericsson Ventures investments of SEK -0.3 b. Reported EBIT was SEK 4.7 (5.3) b. EBITA amounted to SEK 6.1 b. with an EBITA margin of 11.0% when excluding the provision and the revaluation of Ericsson Ventures investments. Reported EBITA was SEK 4.9 (5.5) b. Networks EBIT margin was 18.7% when excluding the provision related to Russia. In addition, EBIT was negatively impacted by timing of software sales in a large contract as well as by increased R&D. Reported EBIT margin was 16.6% (20.0%). Organic sales in Emerging Business and Other grew by 15% YoY driven by Cradlepoint. Reported net income was SEK 2.9 (3.2) b. Free cash flow before M&A was SEK -1.7 (1.6) b. impacted primarily by proactive inventory build-up for supply chain resilience. Net cash on March 31, 2022, was SEK 65.2 b. compared with SEK 43.0 b. on March 31, 2021. Comments from BÃ¶rje Ekholm, President and CEO of Ericsson: âWe continue to execute on our strategy to be a leading mobile infrastructure provider and to establish a focused enterprise business. We see strong business momentum and our investments in technology and a resilient supply chain have allowed us to continue to win market share and deliver on customer commitments in spite of global supply chain challenges. In the quarter, we saw organic sales[1] growth of 3%. Gross margin at 42.3% (42.8%) indicates underlying stability while absorbing cost increases in the supply chain. Our EBITA margin was 11.0%, adjusted for revaluation of holdings and provision related to Russia. Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine and the resulting humanitarian disaster is a major setback for the world. While mobile infrastructure is essential for communications in Russia, it has been clear from the start of the invasion that business in Russia would have to be reconsidered. Following current sanctions, we have announced an indefinite suspension of our affected business in Russia and recorded a provision for impairment of assets and other extraordinary costs of SEK -0.9 b. in Q1. We will continue to monitor and respond to the situation day by day, with priority on the safety and well-being of our people. In our core mobile infrastructure business, we foresee a longer investment cycle compared with previous mobile generations as 5Gâs broad application usage will drive a continued need to increase capacity. Technology leadership is driving our competitiveness, and in the quarter, we invested SEK -10.7 (-9.6) b. in R&D. Networks sales[1] grew organically by 4% in Q1 reflecting our continually strengthened market position. Gross margin was 44.7% (46.1%). Software sales vary between quarters, and a certain SEK 1 b. annual software contract that is normally recorded in Q1, is this year delayed into Q2. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by proactive investments in supply chain resilience. Hard work throughout the organization enabled us to deliver on customer commitments despite global supply chain challenges. We also continue to increase our R&D investments to extend our leadership. R&D increased by SEK -1 b. YoY and was primarily related to our Cloud RAN portfolio, which gives customers more flexible deployment options, and to next generation ASICs that provide industry-leading radio performance, energy savings and footprint reduction. We foresee long-term attractive return on our investments similar to the last few years. Digital Services organic sales[1] were down by -2% YoY in the quarter and EBIT was SEK -1.4 b. We are building a strong platform for Digital Services and sales development in the cloud native 5G core portfolio is encouraging with double digit growth, albeit from a low base. However, the overall result in the quarter is not satisfactory. The target of a limited loss for 2022 is challenging especially in light of the increased investments in R&D in service orchestration and 5G portfolio. We now increase focus on accelerating sales growth and addressing efficiency to improve profitability. To capture opportunities in the rapidly growing enterprise space, we are focusing on two specific areas. The first focus area is wireless networks for enterprise where we already offer easy-to-use pre-packaged solutions, with Cradlepoint showing strong growth in the first quarter as 5G coverage increases on the US C-band. We also see growing momentum for our 5G portfolio in Dedicated Networks. In addition, we are increasing investments in our enterprise go-to-market organization. The other focus area is a Global Network Platform, which will be built on global unified interfaces, so called APIs. Developers and enterprises will be able to create new use cases and experiences, like high quality video or XR on top of the 5G network, which enable operators and the industry to monetize the network investment in new ways. Ericsson intends to play a major role in building the API platform. With our previously announced intention to acquire Vonage ï¿½?more than 1 million developers, 120,000 enterprise customers and a proven scaled API infrastructure ï¿½?we will have a strong position to deliver on this ambition.  Ericssonâs IPR licensing revenues in Q1 were affected by several expiring patent license agreements pending renewal and by 5G license negotiations. We are confident in our strong 5G position and leading patent portfolio, positioning us well to conclude pending and future license renewals. Revenues from current IPR licensing contracts are estimated to SEK 1.0ï¿½?.5 b. in Q2. The actual revenue impact will depend on timing as well as terms and conditions of new agreements. We are currently engaging with the Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the breach notices it issued relating to the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The resolution of these matters could result in a range of actions by DOJ, and may likely include additional monetary payments, the magnitude of which cannot at this time be reliably estimated. As this process is ongoing, we remain limited in what we can say about the historical events covered in the Iraq investigation and our ongoing engagement on the matter. We are fully committed to co-operating with the DOJ and our work to further strengthen our Ethics and Compliance program, controls and our culture remains a top priority. It was actually our improved compliance program that allowed us to identify the misconduct in Iraq that started at least back in 2011. In light of the global supply chain challenges, we decided to create a buffer of vital components in order to secure that we meet customer delivery commitments. In the quarter this had a material impact on inventory levels and therefore Free cash flow before M&A amounted to -1.7 (+1.6) b. We expect elevated inventory levels to remain in the next few quarters. We are well positioned to continue our strategic journey. The mobile infrastructure business will remain our core and we will not spare any effort to strengthen our position here. Our ambition is to continue to grow and develop this business based on market growth and market share gains. In the growing enterprise space, we are seeing good traction for our established portfolio with Cradlepoint and Dedicated Networks. We continue to work towards closing the Vonage acquisition in the first half of 2022 and to start developing the Global Network Platform. With our investments in both our core and enterprise businesses, as well as in our culture, we are determined to continue to make Ericsson a stronger, more resilient company while at the same time put it on a higher growth trajectory. Our key focus is to accelerate the pace towards reaching our long-term target of an EBITA margin of 15ï¿½?8% and our ambition is to reach this target no later than in 2ï¿½? years.ï¿½?SEK b.Q1 2022Q1 2021YoY changeQ4 2021QoQ changeNet sales55.149.811%71.3-23%âSales growth adj. for comparable units and currency[1]Â âÂ âï¿½?%âÂ âÂ Gross margin[1]42.3%42.8%ï¿½?3.2%âEBIT4.75.3-10%11.9-60%EBIT margin[1]8.6%10.6%ï¿½?6.6%âNet income2.93.2-8%10.1-71%EPS diluted, SEK0.880.96-8%3.02-71%Measures excl. restructuring charges[1]Gross margin excluding restructuring charges42.3%42.9%ï¿½?3.5%âEBIT excluding restructuring charges4.85.3-10%12.3-61%EBIT margin excluding restructuring charges8.7%10.7%ï¿½?7.3%âFree cash flow before M&A-1.71.6ï¿½?3.5âNet cash, end of period65.243.052%65.8-1%"
332,0,"UPDATE1: Japan extends COVID quasi-emergency in 17 prefs., ends it in 5 others",509 words,Kyodo News,"Shigeru Omi, the government's top COVID adviser, told a press conference, after a government panel approved the extensions earlier in the day, that two of its members opposed the extension, saying the Omicron variant, which is said to cause no or mild symptoms, does not call for such restrictions. But Prime Minister Fumio Kishida asked for understanding regarding the decision. ""I am making the request as I believe that through proceeding with various measures, we will achieve certain results,"" he said during a House of Representatives Budget Committee meeting. Hitoshi Kikawada, senior vice minister at the Cabinet Office, told the panel that the 17 prefectures seeking extensions ""face the possibility of an increase in the number of patients with severe symptoms and need to reduce the burden on their health care systems."" Kikawada said the strain on hospitals had eased in the five other prefectures -- Yamagata, Shimane, Yamaguchi, Oita and Okinawa. The quasi-emergency measures were set to expire Sunday in 16 of the 17 prefectures and on Feb. 27 in Wakayama in western Japan. The remaining 13 prefectures are Hokkaido, Aomori, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Ishikawa, Nagano, Shizuoka, Hyogo, Okayama, Hiroshima, Saga and Kagoshima. But Japan on Friday confirmed 211 virus-related deaths, the fourth consecutive day that the count has gone over 200. The seven-day rolling average for deaths was also at a record 190. Daily new infections remained high nationwide at 87,723, including 16,129 cases in Tokyo and 11,505 in Osaka Prefecture. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said at a news conference that experts believe the recent wave of infections has likely peaked, and the government plans to ""confirm the downtrends in the infection situation and the strain on hospitals"" in the extended two weeks. The government could lift the measures before the scheduled end date if the situation improves and local governors call for it. The quasi-emergency measures have been in place since January in many of the areas to prevent a surge in COVID-19 patients from overwhelming hospitals. The government will also begin implementing a new policy for allowing children between five and 11 years old to be vaccinated for the first time from late February. As inoculation is not compulsory, authorities will focus on promoting the safety and efficacy of vaccines for children. The highly transmissible Omicron strain tends to cause no or mild symptoms. But elderly people and those with underlying health conditions are more likely to develop severe symptoms requiring medical treatment. ==Kyodo"

776,1,All New L.O.L. Surprise!(TM) Earth Love(TM) with Eco-Friendly Packaging Demonstrates a Big Step Toward MGA Entertainment's Commitment to Sustainability,853 words,PR Newswire,"By Fall 2022, the company plans to transition about 65 percent of their L.O.L.

834,0,4 top publishers to sue U.S. IT firm for âpirateï¿½?manga,403 words,AJW (Asia & Japan Watch),"Publishers Shueisha Inc., Kodansha Ltd., Shogakukan Inc. and Kadokawa Corp. will seek combined damages totaling about 400 million yen ($3.48 million), the sources said. Some of the publishers were successful in shutting down Mangamura, one of Japanâs largest manga piracy websites, in 2018. The publishers decided their best course to protect their copyrights was to pursue the responsibility of the provider of the content delivery network that pirate operators useÂ as identifying such operators based overseas is extremely difficult. The sources said one of the largest pirate magna sites was contracted with Cloudflare and that its server in Japan is used to deliver pirated manga. The site receives around 300 million hits a month and delivers pirated versions of 4,000 works. They include extremely popular works, such as âOne Pieceï¿½?and âAttack on Titan.ï¿½?The publishers said Cloudflareâs content delivery network is essential for pirate operators to distribute a huge amount of data instantaneously when viewers access their sites. Since April 2020, Kodansha, Shueisha, Shogakukan and Kadokawa had each notified Cloudflare in succession to stop delivering the pirated versions based on the U.S. copyright law, but to no avail. TheÂ companies estimated that they each suffered losses to the tune of billions of yenÂ until late last year. They will each seek about 100 million yen in partial damages as well as an end to the delivery ofÂ pirated and copied content. A Cloudflare representative contacted by The Asahi Shimbun replied: âCloudflareâs CDN and pass-through security services do not meaningfully contribute to infringement.ï¿½?After the closure of Mangamura, a similar site called Manga Bank appeared on the internet on 2019. But it, too, was shut down after the publishers filed an information disclosure request against the operators at a U.S. court."
602,0,"Crown, Blackstone confident state regulators will approve $8.9b deal",1094 words,The Sydney Morning Herald - Online,"""There are a few things that need to be done in terms of finalising our probity, but it's mostly done, and I'd have to say we haven't found anything that is going to be a bar to them proceeding,"" he said. Sources close to both Crown and Blackstone are also confident that regulators in Victoria, NSW and WA will also support the transaction and give Blackstone approval to take up Crown's casino licences. Blackstone is hoping to secure the approval to have the deal completed mid-year. The James Packer-controlled Crown has come under significant scrutiny in the past three years amid revelations of serious governance breaches including that some of its customers were engaged in criminal activity such as money laundering. Crown has faced inquiries in all three states where it operates. NSW stripped Crown of its prized licence for Barangaroo in late 2020 following the Bergin Inquiry. A Victorian royal commission into Crown's Melbourne casino led by retired judge Ray Finkelstein, QC, found Crown was unfit to run its flagship property but decided not to recommend cancelling its licence, and instead gave it two years to reform itself. Blackstone has also faced questions about its appropriateness amid concerns about the governance and oversight of its casino businesses in Latin America and Las Vegas. Blackstone - spearheaded by local dealmaker Chris Tynan - lobbed its fourth takeover offer for Crown Resorts this week, hiking the offer to $13.10 a share. Blackstone's newest offer has already gained the approval of the casino's board and the attention of billionaire majority shareholder Mr Packer, who said he was ""encouraged"" by the announcement. The offer is non-binding and subject to further due diligence and approvals from regulators. A binding offer from Blackstone is needed before regulators can make a final call. Former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett, who spearheaded Crown casino's opening in the 1990s after inheriting the project from the Kirner government, said he would ""like nothing more"" than for Crown to be in the hands of new owners with the experience and reputation for governance needed to run it. ""For more than 20 years it has been an icon of quality and our largest single-site employer,"" he told The Age and the Herald. ""I could think of nothing more important than for it to find security through an owner that can with experience provide consistently good governance."" A person close to Blackstone who could not speak publicly about the deal said the private equity firm had done all it could to win over regulators, and did not believe it would struggle to win the approval of the Foreign Investment Review Board which is required for the deal's completion. Crown's chairman, Ziggy Switkowski, would not be drawn on the deal's progression when contacted on Friday, other than to say things were ""working well"". ""We have a number in front of us, there's the due diligence process to be completed by Blackstone, everything's kind of working well between us,"" he said. Crown has been in the crosshairs of a number of buyers since Mr Packer first indicated in May 2019 he would be willing to sell down his stake. Fellow casino operator Star launched a merger proposal in May, which was rejected by the Crown board, and on Thursday said it remained interested in a transaction with Crown. However, the Sydney-based casino operator is facing its own governance scandal, with financial regulator AUSTRAC expanding its probe into alleged breaches of anti-money laundering laws. Mr Crawford said he believed ILGA's assessment of Crown would be finalised within the first quarter of 2022, in line with Blackstone's goal of having shareholders paid out by June. However, ILGA's probity review of Blackstone would not impact its separate assessment into Crown, he said, and whether the company should be able to continue gambling operations in NSW. ""The fact that Blackstone might swan in and become the owner doesn't in itself give them the right to conduct gaming,"" Mr Crawford said. ""The company [Crown] itself needs to prove that it's got adequate systems in place and run it properly and that staff are properly trained and know what they're doing to comply with their legal and governance obligations to make it work."" NSW Hospitality Minister Kevin Anderson said he held confidence in ILGA to complete all necessary checks and balances. ""The authority will be well placed to identify, investigate and prevent serious criminal issues such as those found in the Bergin Review,"" he said. ""In 2021 the government agreed to support all 19 recommendations contained in the Bergin report, including the creation of an independent casino regulator."" A spokeswoman for Victorian Gaming Minister Melissa Horne said since the final report of the Finkelstein inquiry, the government had prioritised what it considered the most urgent actions to restore public trust in the casino. ""The government is undertaking further detailed analysis and consultation on the remaining recommendations,"" she said.  Monash University gambling expert Charles Livingstone said the biggest regulatory hurdle faced by Blackstone would be demonstrating to the Foreign Investment Review Board that the takeover by a US private equity group was in the public interest. But Dr Livingstone said perhaps the biggest issue of all faced by the company would be lower profits as a result of the Finkelstein recommendations, which could cut Crown's revenue by as much as 30 per cent. ""I think the real issue for them is how they're going to make money,"" Dr Livingstone said. ""If the government chooses to implement the reforms of Finkelstein argued for around responsible gambling - that is limits on how long you can gamble for, carded play, amounts pre-set by punters to make sure they don't spend more than they can afford - I mean that would have a big impact."""
991,0,Future Retail hauled into IBC process,291 words,The Telegraph,"Meanwhile FRL, in a regulatory filing, said it has been served and received a copy of the petition and is in the âprocess of taking legal adviceï¿½?

Rutte said lifting the lockdown completely was not an option due to dramatically rising infection figures. ""Everything at the same time is not possible, the risk is too great,"" he said, while noting that there might be a further easing of the rules at the end of the month. Health Minister Ernst Kuipers said the nation had reached a ""new phase of the pandemic."" He acknowledged that many citizens and business owners were distressed by the nationwide lockdown, currently the only in Europe. ""We have to learn to live with the virus,"" Kuipers added but cautioned that the risk of overwhelming the health system remained high. Opposition to the harsh measures grew strongly over the past few days. Restaurant owners have already announced protests for Saturday and some plan to open again for service despite the ban. Many of these businesses have the support of local mayors. In the southern town of Valkenburg, near the German border city of Aachen, many shops and restaurants were already open on Friday. Following the government's decision, shops will again be allowed to receive customers until 5 pm daily. Citizens can have four visitors in their homes at once, up from two previously. Quarantine requirements will no longer apply to those who have received a booster vaccination or were already infected with the coronavirus this year. Up until now, only supermarkets and pharmacies have been allowed to open. The lockdown, which began on December 19, was intended to ease the pressure on hospitals. And despite daily peaks in new infections, the number of patients in hospitals is decreasing. On Friday, more than 35,000 new infections were registered - more than ever before. That is more than 1,300 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over seven days. # Notebook ## Update ## Note to editors - Releads with government announcement and updates throughout - dpa photos"

After long-running tensions, Hardy showed up to a shoot three hours late. Theron had been waiting on set in full make-up for the duration.

499,0,The âOmicron waveï¿½?was the catastrophic dumper that closed our Sunshine Coast restaurant forever,991 words,The Guardian,"Weâve ridden the cash flow ups and downs that all small businesses do. Weâve adjusted our stroke as tourists flood in and flood back out again. We dived under the first pandemic wave in 2020, emerging stronger and more resilient after 11 weeks of lockdown, thanks to the federal governmentâs cash boost and jobkeeper programs, and higher spending by optimistic guests. And now our prime minister has told us to ride the Omicron wave, a catastrophic dumper created by state and federal governments that canât be ridden by small business. Weâve closed our restaurant. Forever. My business partner, Paul Holmes, who opened the restaurant more than six years ago, is a restaurateur with 40 yearsï¿½?experience. He has turned around countless floundering restaurants for others, traded through recessions and run his own successful restaurants. But he couldnât save this business. No one could have. Our regulars came back in droves after the first lockdown. They supported local businesses, including ours. We had our best winter trading since we opened. But the closure of the âPineapple Curtainï¿½?(the Queensland border), although popular with the stateâs voters, has had the longer-term disastrous effect of vaccine hesitancy within the cloistered population. Post-jobkeeper lockdowns during the pandemic exposed the already high-level career insecurity in the hospitality industry, and then supercharged it. Our small business lost qualified and experienced chefs to mining, manufacturing, warehousing management and the food service industry ï¿½?not to other restaurants. They wanted to be able to pay their mortgages and keep their jobs through lockdowns. When our head chef left for personal reasons on 12 September last year, we had to close our restaurant and let all our other staff go as we hadnât been able to find a suitably experienced chef to replace him. By then, weâd already been looking for three months. We took another three months to find a fantastic head chef and a second chef who were pivotal in the rebuilding of our team. We nervously reopened on 10 December. During this search for a chef, there was an online pile-on by anti-vaxxers when we replied âIt is the lawï¿½?to an enquiry asking if the chef had to be vaccinated. We also had a surprising number of applications from people who had âdone some cooking at a cafe for 12 monthsï¿½?and an unsurprising number of applications from chefs living abroad ï¿½?outside our closed national borders. Weâd used a welcome Queensland government grant to fund the increased wages necessary to secure these key staff members and to partially restock the restaurant. Paul had worked with the chef to create a smaller menu to help manage costs. He felt that weâd have to absorb the increase in the price of fresh produce, especially meat and fish, over the last 12 months. Spending per head had dropped noticeably on our return and although locals were pleased the border had opened, they were now nervous about catching Covid. You have to have a certain amount of good luck when running a small business. Some people say you make your own luck. They might be right. But the timing of the bad luck we had on the night we reopened was the beginning of the end. The kitchenâs exhaust fan motor seized that first night, making the temperature in our kitchen about 50C. Weâd already limited guest bookings by half to just 25 people to allow our new kitchen team to cope with working together with a new menu in a new environment. In a Christmas miracle, we located a great air-conditioning mechanic who could diagnose the problem and replace the unit or repair the motor. Replacement would take until February due to international shipping delays (Covid) or he could retrofit a different unit by Christmas. We chose the latter. Unfortunately, the unit got caught up in trucking delays from Melbourne (Covid) and the new motor seized eight minutes after it was installed in late December, due to damage acquired from poor packing prior to transport (possibly not Covid). Our chefs worked for three weeks in great discomfort. The final nail in our coffin was hammered in on 7 January when the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, urged people to work from home if they were able and avoid socialising for the next six weeks. Cancellations went through the roof and bookings through the floor. You canât run a restaurant in a ghost town. When one of our staff was declared a close contact of someone with Covid last Friday, we decided to decline the offer of the federal government to allow us to trade insolvent and have closed our once-$1m-turnover business. Thankfully, weâre walking away with no debt. Our landlord deserves special mention. He rang us before the first lockdown in 2020 and offered us a two-month rent holiday before any government had offered small business any support. And he has worked with us on making our rent affordable during the whole pandemic. He has been compassionate and generous throughout. The poor planning and poll-driven decisions by governments has defeated us. An economy ï¿½?the real one that youâll find in main streets, shopping centres and in tourist towns ï¿½?collapses when citizens are too afraid to leave their homes and when small businesses all over the country close. * Teresa Russell is a Sydney-based freelance writer and silent(ish) partner in Ocean Ended, a Sunshine Coast restaurant, now closed.

851,0,"Young decries needle lies, damage done on Spotify",574 words,USA Today,"""I am doing this because Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines ï¿½?potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them,"" Young said. ""Please act on this immediately today and keep me informed of the time schedule. ""I want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform,"" Young continued. ""They can have (Joe) Rogan or Young. Not both."" Spotify did not immediately respond to USA TODAY for comment late Monday. Rogan, host of ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" who tested positive for COVID-19 in September, had downplayed the need for mass vaccines for large events like comedy shows. Launched in 2009, Rogan's podcast is among the most popular in the United States. In 2020, Spotify acquired Rogan's podcast library in a deal reportedly worth more than $100 million, according to the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, Young, the hall of fame rocker, is the latest to openly challenge Spotify about Rogan's controversial comments about the vaccines. Young's pushback comes nearly a month after nearly 300 doctors, physicians and science educators signed an open letter also demanding Spotify stop spreading Rogan's commentary and ""moderate misinformation on its platform."" The letter said Rogan has ""repeatedly spread misleading and false claims"" and ""a number of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories"" on his podcast, provoking distrust in science and medicine. They also claim Rogan has discouraged vaccination in young people and children, and ""incorrectly claimed that Moderna vaccines are 'gene therapy,' promoted off-label use of ivermectin"" to treat COVID-19 that's contrary to warnings by the Food and Drug Administration. ""With an estimated 11 million listeners per episode, JRE, which is hosted exclusively on Spotify, is the world's largest podcast and has tremendous influence,"" the physicians' letter said. ""Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform, though the company presently has no misinformation policy."" Rogan's social media pages frequently mention the debate over COVID-19 vaccines. Last year, Rogan said on Instagram to treat his symptoms he turned to ivermectin, among other treatments not approved by the FDA. Ivermectin has been approved by the FDA for use by people and animals to treat parasitic infections, mostly in livestock. The agency has repeatedly said that using any treatment for COVID-19 that's not approved or authorized by them, unless part of a clinical trial, ""can cause serious harm."" However, vaccines are scientifically proven as the best possible method to slow the spread of the virus, medical experts say. Also, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also repeatedly recommended that Americans receive the vaccine. Young is no stranger to pulling his music off Spotify. He removed his music off of the platform and other music streaming services in 2015, stating he felt their audio quality was too low. His music reappeared on those platforms the following year.

972,0,Dine-in restaurants in Delhi worried by fresh covid curbs,834 words,Mint,"Last Friday, restaurants in Delhi were allowed to provide dine-in services till 9 pm, only on weekdays. DDMA imposed a weekend curfew in the city and shut malls and restaurants on Saturdays and Sundays. Restaurant operators fear that after Delhi, other states may also consider further curbs on dining in. The suspension of dine-in services after one quarter of good business will lead to major loss of business in the fourth quarter, they said. ""The Omicron variant is not dangerous, but the reality is that the number of cases is soaring. The government has to take steps, but they should find a fine balance so that the most vulnerable industries, such as food and beverages, are allowed to survive. Deliveries, regardless of the type of format restaurants operate in, do not make up for more than 30-40% of the total turnover,"" said Anjan Chatterjee, hotelier and founder of publicly-traded Speciality Restaurants, which runs chains such as Oh! Calcutta and Mainland China. Restaurateurs said they have already been complying with various rules imposed and are seeing a reduction of up to 50% in dine-in revenues because of seating restrictions. Restaurants have also had to comply with business hour restrictions with daily night and weekend curfews that started at the end of December around the time of New Year festivities. Such announcements are leading to a working capital crisis as rents have to be paid regardless of the disruption, said Ajit Shah, co-founder at White Panda Hospitality. ""The policies are not conducive to continuing business. Political rallies are still going on and the local governments have to realize that we also generate a lot of revenue. They need to support us, too,"" he said. Zorawar Kalra, founder at Massive Restaurants, which runs chains such as Farzi Cafe and Masala Library and delivery-chain Louis Burger, said he is hopeful that if hospitalizations and morbidities do not increase, these restrictions can be quickly removed as they are extremely debilitating for the already beleaguered industry. ""If they continue, they will result in a major increase in permanent closures and unemployment in the sector,"" he said. Dine-in restaurants are panicking, but for companies whose primary focus has been home deliveries, it is likely to be a good run. A spurt in the delivery business is expected, said Mansher Duggal, co-founder of Delhi-based Enoki Hospitality, which runs 10 cloud kitchens for Asian and North Indian cuisines. His business, he said, saw about 40% growth in the last lockdown in April-May 2021. However, restaurants should be allowed to continue operations with 50% capacity with strict regulations allowing only fully vaccinated guests, similar to the norms followed in the US and the UK, Duggal said. More restrictions on restaurants will send an industry that is still recovering into complete disarray, he said. The size of the restaurant industry shrank by more than 50% from Rs.4,23,624 crore in FY20 to about Rs.2,00,762 crore in FY21, the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) said. The association said Delhi NCR is the 'restaurant capital' of India with the highest number of restaurants in the country. There are about 95,187 eateries in Delhi including both organized and unorganized players. Out of this, 32,777 are organized (with FSSAI number and GST). ""While unorganized will also take the brunt of these new guidelines, the real brunt will come from the organized segment as they have a complete chain/employees, government taxes, suppliers etc. to deal with,"" said the association's president Kabir Suri. Organized players in the city generate a revenue of Rs.31,132 crores since the dine-out frequency in Delhi is the highest as compared to the national average. Delhi eats out about six times a month as compared to the national average of 4.5 times a month. Suri said takeaway and delivery is just a meagre of this entire pie. ""We are also very worried about the fate of the over 3 lakh people employed in Delhi restaurants. We don't want them to suffer but unfortunately, we don't have adequate resources to support them for long,"" he added. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT."
219,1,"Rlys targets 1,700 mt freight this fiscal year",492 words,Business Standard,"âThe Budget estimated freight loading for the next fiscal year at 1,475 mt, which was a conservative estimate. Our freight loading for this year was 1,418 mt, where we also achieved the highest-ever annual growth at 15 per cent. Naturally, we have to go over and above the Budget if we want to fulfil our objectives under the National Rail Plan (NRP),ï¿½?a senior ministry official told Business Standard. The ministryâs internal estimates point to a sharp uptick in freight demand, majorly coming from its core basket of commodities. The national transporter recently floated a tender for the acquisition of 90,000 wagons over the next three financial years, along with a push for track development with respect to dedicated freight corridors (DFCs). The Centre has completed 1,110 km of construction on two DFCs, while three other corridors were also recently sanctioned, Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told Parliament. The freight target of 1,700 mt for this fiscal year is about 20 per cent higher than the goods loaded in FY22. Railways has, so far, not achieved this level of increment in freight loading in a single year. Under the National Rail Plan (NRP), the Centre wants to increase its modal freight share to 45 per cent by 2030. According to government estimates, consolidated demand for freight will be over 6,300 mt by 2026 and 8,220 mt by 2031. According to these estimates, Railways will need to account for over 3,600 mt in 2031 to meet its modal freight share targets. In the medium-term, it is targeting over 2,000 mt by 2024, the official said. Business Standard had previously reported that the national transporter launched an ambitious ~1-trillion-plan for various infrastructure projects, through which it wants to add ~79,000 crore to its freight revenue by 2024. Sector experts have pointed out that the ambitious targets can only be achieved through a steady gain in modal freight share, as economic activity will have to scale up rapidly to be the sole factor influencing growth targets for the railways. âRail freight witnessed a robust growth of around 15 per cent in FY 2022 to 1418 mt supported by improvement in reduced transit time and cost efficiencies(through long term tariff contract, traditional empty flow direction schemes). While the rising fuel prices and the consequent hike in road freight increases the competitiveness of rail as a mode but target of 1700 mt looks steep; 1500-1550 mt is achievable,ï¿½?said ICRA's Rajeshwar Burla."

The key focus now is to accelerate the pace towards reaching the long-term target of an EBITA margin of 15-18 percent. The goal is to achieve this target within 2-3 years. Revenues for the quarter rose to SEK 55.1 billion from 49.8 billion, with group organic revenues up 3 percent, driven by Networks in North America, Europe and Latin America. Organic sales in Emerging Business and Other grew by 15 percent, pushed by Cradlepoint. EBIT slipped to SEK 4.7 billion from 5.3 billion, with the margin going to 8.6 percent form 10.6 percent. Excluding the provision and a revaluation of Ericsson Ventures investments of SEK, the figure went to SEK 5.9 billion, with a margin of 10.7 percent. The Networks EBIT margin amounted to 18.7 percent excluding the provision. Ericsson said the figure was negatively impacted by the timing of software sales in a large contract, as well as by R&D expenses. The net profit also declined, to SEK 2.9 billion from 3.2 billion, with diluted earnings per share off at SEK 0.88 from 0.96. The free cash flow fell to a negative SEK 1.7 billion from a positive 1.6 billion, mainly because of the inventory build-up. Net cash at end March was still higher, at SEK 65.2 billion, from the 43 billion recorded the year before."

Journalists are a high-priority target for government-backed hackers seeking intelligence. In 2013, Chinese hackers infiltrated the Wall Street Journal's network, apparently with the intent of spying on reporters covering China. The New York Times experienced a similar attack. Tech supply chain: The hackers targeted News Corp's third-party technology suppliers, according to a company filing. The attack came as U.S. officials over the past year have been increasingly warning of criminal and nation-state hackers breaking into the computer systems of organizations through sometimes opaque supply chains for software and other technologies. Swissport hit with ransomware. Swiss aviation services company Swissport International said it suffered a ransomware attack that caused flight delays. The company provides hospitality, luggage, cargo handling, cleaning and other services for 310 airports in 50 countries. Swissport tweeted on Friday that the attack was ""largely contained."" A spokesperson for the company told Der Spiegel that ground services for airlines were able to continue without IT systems running, but delays were caused by the disruption. (Bleeping Computer)  Microsoft says group linked to Russia's security service targets Ukrainian government. A hacker group that the Ukrainian government previously linked to Russia's Federal Security Service has been targeting Ukrainian government and military offices, and nonprofit organizations for the last six months. Goals appear to be accessing sensitive information, maintaining system access and moving laterally into other organizations. The hacker group has targeted or compromised emergency response organizations that coordinate international and humanitarian aid in Ukraine. Hackers went after crisis aid. Microsoft said the group, which it calls Actinium, uses phishing emails to impersonate legitimate organizations. One email appeared to come from the World Health Organization containing information about the spread of Covid-19. Careers First 90 Days: Selim Aissi  Selim Aissi , who in January joined Blackhawk Network Holdings Inc . as CISO, is due this month to deliver a three-year cybersecurity plan to top leaders at the payments company. The plan will cover internal security and the protection of Blackhawk products. Mr. Aissi has a long career in cybersecurity leadership and safety systems, most recently overseeing cyber at ICE Mortgage Technology , which was formed when Intercontinental Exchange Inc ., the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, bought Ellie Mae Inc . in 2020 in a deal valued at $11 billion. He had been at Ellie Mae since 2015 and has experience at Visa Inc ., Intel Corp ., General Motors Co . and General Dynamics Corp . He discussed his process with WSJ Pro Cybersecurity. Assessing the mechanics: I do my own analysis based on a combination of several frameworks. I use NIST [National Institute of Standards and Technology ] as a base. I leverage the SANS Institute framework for maturity. I've dealt with Gartner and others in the past. I combine all of those in my assessment. I go through every control, every security tool in place. I look at, are we governing the right way. Protecting Blackhawk products: Over the past couple of weeks I've been looking at every product for different attributes. Does the product touch personally identifiable information? Who is the customerâbusiness or consumer? What are the risks? I digest other assessments done in the past, like audit reports, independent penetration testing reports, internal penetration testing reports. Is the product generating a lot more revenue than othersâthat's also a key attribute. I want to know where the hot spots are, focus on products that have had some issues or are more vulnerable than others. Relationships: I try to meet with as many leaders as I canâthe privacy team, internal audit, product development. I try to get to know them but also try to understand the relationship with security they have had, and see opportunities for improvements, where I need to pay attention. I want to understand in my organization's skillsets and any gaps. Things I want to focus on this year are people development and diversity. The result: The plan will be based on all of this discovery. I tend to deliver something that my team can execute. It's not theoretical. It's very practical. And it's highly prioritized, quarter by quarter, tied to the strategic objectives of the company. âKim S. Nash Privacy  Facebook loses appeal against Australian privacy regulator. Australia's federal court rejected Facebook Inc .'s claim that it doesn't do business in Australia and called the argument ""divorced from reality."" The ruling allows the Australian Information Commissioner to serve legal documents on the company. The regulator filed proceedings against Facebook Inc . and its Irish subsidiary Facebook Ireland in 2020 for violating the privacy rights of individuals because of the company Cambridge Analytica's harvesting of Facebook users' data. The Australian Information Commissioner's said the office will move forward with the case. Meta says privacy restrictions may force it to shut down in Europe. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc . said it would "" likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram , in Europe"" if the U.S. and European Union don't adopt a new agreement enabling personal data transfers between the jurisdictions. The EU's top court determined that the Privacy Shield arrangement was illegal in a 2020 ruling. In 2020, Facebook issued a similar warning in an Irish court filing.

All these accounts are based in Pakistan. The accounts were spreading toxic and baseless information and against the sovereignty of the country. This is a sort of a war of misinformation against the country and that is why we have used the emergency provisions under the IT Rules.ï¿½?The Ministry said that Indian intelligence agencies closely monitored these social media accounts and websites and had flagged them to the Ministry for immediate action. I&B Ministry Joint secretary Vikram Sahay said orders were issued on January 20 to the respective social media companies (intermediaries) and the internet service providers through the Department of Telecom for blocking all these accounts, and that is underway. âThe anti-India and fake content on these social media accounts and sites was on various subjects such as Indian Armed Forces, Jammu & Kashmir and Indiaâs foreign relations with other countries. Rampant fake news was also spread through the YouTube channels regarding the tragic demise of the former Chief of Defence Staff Late General Bipin Rawat besides separatist ideas and notions, among others,ï¿½?he added. The Ministryâs statement added the 35 accounts were identified to be part of four coordinated disinformation networks. âThese include the Apni Duniya Network operating 14 YouTube channels, and Talha Films Network operating 13 YouTube channels. A set of four channels, and a set of two other channels were also found to be acting in synchronization with each other,ï¿½?the statement added. Replying to a query, Chandra said that intelligence agencies and the Ministry would continue to take action against such accounts. He added that this is also the responsibility of the intermediaries, and in their systems, such accounts spreading fake and toxic information should get flagged. He added intermediaries have been quite receptive to the orders issued by the Ministry. âVide five separate orders issued under rule 16 of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, the Ministry has ordered to block these Pakistan based social media accounts and websites,ï¿½?the Ministryâs statement added. In December, the Ministry ordered the blocking of 20 YouTube channels and two websites for spreading anti-India fake news.

145,0,Breville brews up $168m deal for specialty Italian coffee group,450 words,The Australian,"Breville announced on Friday that half of the deal would be paid in cash and half by the issue of fully paid ordinary shares in Breville priced at $27.64 apiece, subject to a five-year trading lock post completion.  Breville said the cash portion would be funded from existing reserves and debt facilities, and that key members of the LELIT Group management team, including the founders, had agreed to join the company. Founded in Castegnato, Italy in 1985, LELIT designs, manufactures and markets premium Prosumer home coffee equipment. LELIT coffee machines can sell for as much as $5000 and have state-of-the-art technology and machinery that can be used by professional baristas but also people at home who desire a coffee made on a commercial device.  Breville already has an existing coffee machine business along with its portfolio of other kitchen appliances. Breville said that as a rapidly growing disrupter in the premium Italian-made espresso machine and grinder market, LELIT complements Brevilleâs award-winning coffee portfolio and brings together two iconic companies in the design and distribution of pre-eminent home coffee equipment. Breville CEO Jim Clayton said the deal brought together the two great coffee cultures of the world: Italy and Australia. âBoth companies have a shared passion for using product innovation to improve our customersï¿½?coffee experience at home, and we look forward to working alongside LELIT and its existing partners to further accelerate its growth and product innovation, while preserving the values that underpin its Italian identity,ï¿½?he said. The transaction is expected to complete by early July 2022 following a pre-acquisition restructure of the Italian company. LELIT chief executive, Emanuele Epis, said: âBreville Group is the ideal strategic partner to support LELIT in its next stage of growth, at the same time enabling us to remain faithful to our Italian heritage and design.ï¿½?âWe look forward to leveraging Brevilleâs global platforms, capabilities and infrastructure to further strengthen our success on a global scale.ï¿½?Last month Breville ï¿½?which counts retail billionaire Solomon Lewâs Premier Investments as its biggest shareholder with a stake of just under 26 per cent ï¿½?booked a 25 per cent jump in interim profit to $77.7m as sales rose about 24 per cent to $878.7m."
48,0,"As Omicron sweeps through again, Britain has finally learnt to live with Covid-19",711 words,City AM Online,"According to the reliable Zoe Covid data produced by Kingâs College London, there have been two previous peaks, on 10 January and 13 February. The former was slightly higher in terms of the daily number of total cases, at 2.75 million compared to 2.68 million. Already, the current surge has overtaken the previous peak. Yesterday, 3.4 million people in the UK were estimated to have Covid. The peak of this wave has not yet been reached. This should be in the first few days of April, at over 4.25 million according to the Zoe data. Itâs more than half the previous high point back in January. In a seemingly paradoxical way, this is good news. Several bits of good news, in fact, the first of which takes a bit of time to explain. Read more  Moderna scouts for 3,000 British volunteers for new Omicron-specific jab[https://www.cityam.com/moderna-scouts-for-3000-british-volunteers-for-new-omicron-specific-jab/]  Virologists established some time ago that the new variant of Omicron, the so-called BA.2 is even more infectious than the original version. Omicron itself is considerably more infectious than the previously dominant variants such as Delta. In the opening months of the pandemic in spring 2020, there was a newfound obsession with a previously unknown and mysterious measurement ï¿½?the âRï¿½?of the virus, or the initial âreproduction numberï¿½? Essentially, this is a measure of the ease with which any virus transmits itself in a social gathering. We donât hear much, if anything, about it these days. But the R number of the latest Omicron variant is so high that almost everyone in the country will end up catching it. The epidemiological models themselves, as opposed to rules they have been used to justify, do have powerful insights. One of these is a fairly simple formula which tells us the eventual proportion of a population which will end up having caught it ï¿½?based on the R number. But there is a major qualification to this, one which has tripped up the epidemiologists time and again. Read more  Hong Kong hit by surging cases as city looks to sue airline for flying in Omicron[https://www.cityam.com/hong-kong-hit-by-surging-cases-as-city-looks-to-sue-airline-for-flying-in-omicron/]  The formula only holds good as long as behaviour remains unchanged. If people respond to a virus by reducing their levels of social interaction, the effective level of the reproduction number is also reduced. And as a consequence, if the behavioural change persists, the eventual proportion of the population who catch it will be lower. In the January and February waves of Covid, despite the relaxation of restrictions most people were exercising caution. Social mixing remained lower than what it was before the start of the pandemic in early 2020. But the massive surge during March shows very clearly that most people are now behaving very differently. Further the ease with which the latest Omicron variant is transmitted means that it will shortly run out of people to infect. Re-infection does seem possible, but only at very low rates. So there are signs this latest wave really will be the last major one of Omicron. In the meantime, rolling out the fourth wave of vaccines to the particularly vulnerable makes very good sense. Finally, it seems that Britain has learned to live with Covid-19.

Many restaurant owners across the US say they are feeling the strain of soaring inflation rates. Laura Dickey, the chief executive of Texas-based barbecue chain Dickey's Barbecue Pit, told Fox News[https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/inflation-challenge-restaurant-financial-dickeys-barbecue-pit] that she's been noticing a shift in how her customers spend their money, which has a knock-on effect for her business. Inflation hit a 41-year high[https://www.businessinsider.com/inflation-cpi-march-bright-spots-signal-cooling-core-price-growth-2022-4] in March.

Dickey said the impact of inflation has been challenging for her restaurants. She's noticed ""recession-oriented behavior"" from her customers as they become more price-conscious and concerned about what they're spending their money on. Dickey's observations on people's food budgets chime with new data released from a poll[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-12/how-high-is-inflation-most-americans-cut-back-spending-on-gas-food-sports?sref=lAVQtUwz] conducted for Bloomberg about American consumers' spending.

Elsewhere, the number of snooker clubs dropped to 700 last year, down from 720 while casinos and gambling clubs dropped from 140 to 130. These leisure venues have struggled as the market presence of online games and gambling accelerated amid lockdowns. The number of war game venues, such as Laser Quest and paintball, rose last year, with a six per cent jump. The rise was put down to the businesses being quick and cheap to set up in commercial units. The gym sector has boomed as operators take advantage of cheaper rents, with a 10 per cent jump in the number of sites. There were 4,4000 gyms in 2021, up from 4,000 in 2020. Terence Ritchie, principal at EMW, said gyms were âleading the wayï¿½?in planting roots in territory that has historically been used by retail firms. He explained: âMost high streets cannot sustain being retail-only destinations in the post-pandemic world. To retain the footfall they need, they are becoming mixed retail and leisure, offering a wider range of experiences for consumers.ï¿½?âThe pandemic has created losers as well as winners in the leisure sector, with the lockdown accelerating the change in consumer tastes. Leisure businesses that havenât been able to attract younger customers have seemingly struggled more.ï¿½?Other businesses to see hikes included bowling alleys and cinemas while nightclub numbers dropped as the sector was hit hard by lockdown measures.

Numerous Western companies and retail chains have withdrawn from Russia since the war in Ukraine. For example, the furniture chain Ikea's department stores are open until the last day on Friday. According to Annala, business in St. Petersburg became challenging first with the corona pandemic and then with the war.

The company has already announced this week that it will remove products of Russian origin from the selections of its stores. The products of the prisms are sold out SOK has 16 Prisma and three Sokos Hotels in St. Petersburg. There are a total of about a thousand employees.

Investors with Losses in Excess of $100K to Secure Counsel Before Important April 25 Deadline in Securities Class Action - GATO",728 words,Newsfile,"WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Gatos Silver class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=3100[https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/KJDQ1haKz3] or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com[mailto:pkim@rosenlegal.com] or cases@rosenlegal.com[mailto:cases@rosenlegal.com] for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 25, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the technical report for Gatos Silver's primary mine, the Cerro Los Gatos deposit, contained certain errors; (2) among other things, the mineral reserves had been overestimated by as much as 50%; and (3) as a result of the foregoing, defendants' positive statements about Gatos Silver's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

859,0,Neil Young leaving Spotify wonât get rid of Joe Rogan now ï¿½?but it might eventually,1009 words,Independent Online,"Young is correct. And his threatened boycott is a powerful and worthwhile pushback against Covid conspiracy theories and disinformation. Itâs valuable in part because it raises awareness. But itâs also valuable because it is effectively a kind of labor action, and points towards possibilities for solidarity among artists as workers. As Young says, Joe Rogan has been a major vector for vaccine disinformation. He has promoted vaccine denialists, discouraged[https://www.thewrap.com/joe-rogan-slammed-for-deeply-irresponsible-anti-vaccine-comments/] vaccination in young people, suggested the horse de-wormer ivermectin[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/joe-rogan-covid19-misinformation-ivermectin-spotify-podcast-1219976/] as a Covid cure, and spread other Covid conspiracy theories and falsehoods. Scientists and medical professionals have urged Spotify[https://spotifyopenletter-wordpress-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/2022/01/10/an-open-letter-to-spotify/] to institute a clear public health misinformation policy. The misinformation is especially dangerous because Rogan has a huge audience. He has an exclusive deal with Spotify, and is the #1 podcast on the site, with an estimated 11 million listeners[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-14/spotify-pressured-by-270-scientists-medical-professionals-over-joe-rogan-episode]. Thatâs a big audience. If Spotify is forced to choose between Rogan and Young, theyâll probably choose Rogan. Neil Young is a very popular artist, but his heyday was some decades back. Chartmasters.org lists[https://chartmasters.org/most-streamed-artists-ever-on-spotify/] him as the 776th streamed artist on the service, a little below Lily Allen and Ice Cube and a little above Sean Kingston and Tears for Fears. Spotify would miss those 1.49 billion streams, but theyâd miss Roganâs audience more. That doesnât mean that Youngâs protest doesnât matter. He remains an important cultural figure, and his words are likely to reach an audience that doesnât necessarily pay close attention to political news or analysis. Itâs also useful to have a cultural figure with a lot of mainstream credibility say that what Rogan is doing is wrong. At the very least, for people who are taking the pandemic seriously and are looking for reassurance in a very frightening time, itâs heartening to see a respected figure say heâs with you and he wants to help, in whatever small way he can. There is a scenario, though, in which Youngâs singular protest could become something more than symbolic. Thatâs if other creators start to follow suit. Many musicians have spoken out in one way or another[https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/stars-whove-spoken-out-about-getting-the-covid-19-vaccine/america-ferrara/] in support of vaccinations or on behalf of progressive political goals. Paul McCartney (448 on Spotify streaming) of the Beatles (44) has publicly promoted vaccination. So have Lady Gaga (39), Billie Eilish (13), Lizzo (344), and Ariana Grande ï¿½?who is number 4 in tracks streamed. Taylor Swift (9) has endorsed[https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/04/taylor-swifts-tennessee-equality-project-donation] Democratic politicians. And what about Bob Dylan (260) or BeyoncÃ© (35)? Rogan or Young: thatâs an easy decision. Rogan or Young/McCartney/Eilish/Grande/Swift/Dylan/BeyoncÃ©, though ï¿½?thatâs a different issue. Thereâs no indication yet that other artists are going to join Young, though. Artists have a lot of money and a certain level of autonomy, but political activism can still come at a major cost, as the Chicks found to their sorrow[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/18/dixie-chicks-used-and-abused-by-everybody-who-wanted-to-make-money-off-us]. Spotify is income artists may not want to lose. They donât want to alienate fans. And they might worry about taking a stand and then having Spotify do nothing, at which point they end up looking irrelevant. No artist wants to look irrelevant. Of course, the risks to individual artists go down the more artists participate. Political action over suffers from a collectivity problem. The first person to stand up makes themselves a target. When you come in later, youâre safer and more effective. But itâs difficult to coordinate the logistics of getting everyone to stand up all at once. Thatâs why unions are so important ï¿½?in general, and specifically in pushing for Covid safety. The Chicago Teacherâs Union forced[https://news.wttw.com/2022/01/10/students-set-return-classroom-chicago-teachers-suspend-labor-action] Mayor Lori Lightfoot to agree to more Covid-19 testing, more KN95 masks, and better contact-tracing in schools, protecting their members and students. Florida schools, meanwhile, where unions are weak and teachers arenât allowed to strike[https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2020/01/13/rally-vs--strike--why-it-matters-for-florida-teachers], havenât even been able to impose mask mandates, thanks to state interference[https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2022/01/03/florida-schools-unwilling-to-defy-desantis-again-wont-reimpose-student-mask-mandates/?sh=2fe6ff78674b]. Neil Young is able to get his pro-vaccine message across because heâs Neil Young, the guy who would rather burn out than fade away. The power of BeyoncÃ© is that she, and no one else, is uniquely BeyoncÃ©. The power of Taylor Swift is that she is Taylorâs version of herself. Celebrities are all about the iconic oneness. But musicians ï¿½?even very successful musicians ï¿½?are also workers. They are paid because they make stuff: vinyl, streams, well-coordinated shows. Neil Young has threatened to withdraw the product of his labor from Spotify because he wants safer working and living conditions for himself and everyone else on the continent and beyond. Thatâs a noble decision. But even rich and famous workers are stronger when theyâre united. To change Spotify and the world, you need more than celebrity. You need solidarity.

135,0,"Former user recalls secret drug parties in hotel rooms, condos and HDB flats",1246 words,The Straits Times,"The parties were often organised by children of wealthy families, including expatriates. They are young and loaded - slang for rich and also for being under the influence of drugs. There would be alcohol and music at the events, while some would retreat to a corner to use drugs. Most people at the parties Adam attended were under 30. He went through periods where he would be at one every weekend, with some hosted in expensive hotels and condominiums and others at Housing Board flats. Some of these parties were organised entirely around drugs, where all partygoers would be partaking; others involved alcohol and other activities with just a few people taking drugs. At one such party in 2019 in Fajar Road, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) arrested seven teenagers - aged between 13 and 18. Some of these drug parties have ended in tragedy. In 2018, a 19-year-old medical student from the National University of Singapore died after taking 25B-NBOMe, a new psychoactive substance that is a modified version of lysergic acid diethylamide, more commonly known as LSD or acid. He had attended a ""trip"" party, a term used to describe getting high. A polytechnic student who organised the illicit gathering was later charged. The drugs are not cheap. During the pandemic, the price of MDMA, a psychoactive drug commonly known as Ecstasy or Molly, went up to $80 a pill from $50 a pill. Other drugs such as ketamine went up to $130 to $200 a gram, from $80 to $100 a gram. More On This Topic S'pore youth more likely to perceive cannabis as not harmful Work needed to prevent the young from becoming next generation of drug abusers: Faishal Adam said he rarely met drug dealers himself, but he was always in contact with people who knew them. Encrypted messaging apps are a popular platform. Checks by ST last year showed that on 20 Telegram chat groups selling drugs and drug paraphernalia, most had about 300 to 500 members while a few had more than 2,400 members. After payment is made, sellers would leave the drugs with runners or at drop-off points. Between Jan 2019 and Sept 17 last year, the Central Narcotics Bureau arrested 77 traffickers linked to Telegram transactions. Adam, now 23 and doing his national service, said he would often gather with groups of close friends - a collection of both Singaporeans and expats and children of expats - to use substances like cannabis and MDMA. The phenomenon of drug use among Singapore's international community and some wealthy people here has surfaced in the news from time to time. In 2019, the scion of a rich business family in Singapore pleaded guilty to cannabis possession and consumption. He was sentenced to a jail term of two years and two months. He started smoking marijuana at 21, while studying overseas, and continued the habit on his return to Singapore. Adam started at an even younger age. He was 14 when he first smoked marijuana. A group of friends from secondary school had offered it to him at the playground of a condominium where one of them lived. He said he started doing drugs to deal with anxiety and attention deficit hyperactive disorder and later switched to harder drugs. ""As cliched as it sounds, every drug I've done later was for the thrill of finding the next high. I was 15 when I tried acid, 18 when I started using benzos, 20 when I did my first line of cocaine, ketamine and MDMA."" Benzos is short for benzodiazepines, a class of psychoactive drugs used to treat depression or anxiety, which he has been diagnosed with. Adam said his parents - his father works in drug rehabilitation - were suspicious. But he continued to do relatively well in school and earned himself a diploma. So they trusted him. He said he was influenced by what he watched and read. After reading The Perks Of Being A Wallflower by American writer Stephen Chbosky, Adam wanted to be Bob. Bob was a stereotypical stoner, a character in the American coming-of-age book where several teenage characters use drugs such as marijuana and LSD. ""I did acid for the first time because I was stupid, didn't know better and thought I was the main character in Skins."" Skins is a British TV show that also explores teenage drug use.

When he was a child, he was sexually assaulted by his sister, who is now in jail for a separate offence involving drug trafficking. He said the drugs were not just recreational but also a coping mechanism for pain which he felt therapy could not solve, especially during a period of about 10 months beginning in March 2020. He said: ""(During) my worst spiral and drug bender, Molly was my drug of choice."" He would pop pills every weekend and also tried to end his life several times. While his first contact with drugs was through his friends, it was also his social group that got him out of hard drugs, he said. He said: ""My friends saw how much I was spiralling and we all decided to stay sober together and cut ourselves off from people who dealt (drugs)."" Adam added that while he agrees with Singapore's hard stance against drugs, he is concerned that it may drive people to consume whatever they can get their hands on. He said: ""I think drugs are bad and do a lot of harm to families and the community. But it's not going to stop the young from trying drugs at a party or a rave.""

""This is a way to help bridge the gap between what employers are looking for and the job seeker who is looking for opportunities."" There are nearly 7,000 jobs up for grabs across the London area, Lakhotia said. Participating businesses in the job fair come from a cross-section of industries in the London region, including advanced manufacturing, food processing and t echnology. Some of the big names include Toyota Boshoku Canada, Western University, North Star Windows and Doors, and Dr. Oetker. ""There's a whole host of small, medium and large companies participating, given that demand for labour in all industry sectors,"" Lakhotia said. ""Many are positions that require no particular skills or experience and employers are providing (job seekers) adequate training ."" The job fair, which will take place on April 26 at White Oaks Mall, comes at a time of strong performance for the London economy. In March, the London area posted its lowest unemployment rate since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic at 5.3 per cent. During the past two years, the region has recouped the more than 30,000 jobs it lost during the virus's first wave starting in March 2020 and has added nearly 23,000 new positions on top of that. Now businesses complain a lack of qualified workers is hindering their growth plans. According to the Elgin Middlesex Oxford Workforce Planning and Development Board, about 64 per cent of London-area employers which responded to its survey said they had trouble filling job vacancies in 2021, taking anywhere from three months to a year to fill a position or leaving the position unfilled. Sixty-one per cent of businesses which took part in the same survey said keeping employees is a concern for their organization, up from 53 per cent who answered the same way in 2020. Besides businesses, nearly a dozen job agencies also will be at the job fair to help job seekers with things such as writing resumes or preparing for interviews, said Lakhotia, adding in-person job fairs remain an important tool to connect companies with job seekers. ""We know that a lot of people rely on online job searching... but despite this online presence, traditional job fairs are still very relevant and appropriate for job seekers to meet with employers, learn more about their business and the type of opportunities they're looking for in order to find the best fit,"" he said.

982,0,"When Quitting Normalizes, Benefit to Low-Wage Workers May Subside; Prepandemic evidence shows lengthening tenure alone not enough to improve job quality for some workers, economists say",828 words,The Wall Street Journal Online,"The resulting imbalance between available jobs and workers to fill them favored the workers, said Nick Bunker, an economist at the jobs site Indeed. In December, job openings exceeded job seekers by five million, up from just over one million in January 2020. Three percent of workers quit their job that month, up from 2.3% in January 2020. December's quit rate was twice as high in leisure and hospitality, a proxy for the low-wage workforce, compared with the overall workforce. To attract and retain such workers, restaurant and retail chains announced major wage increases throughout 2021 and early 2022. McDonald's Corp.'s U.S. restaurants raised wages by an average of 15% [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/mcdonalds-sales-rise-as-u-s-menu-prices-climb-11635332402] last year, while Target Corp. in February said starting hourly wages for store and supply-chain workers will range from $15 to $24. But quitting may have peaked. Quit rates in leisure and hospitality have dropped to 5.6% in February 2022 from 5.9% in November 2021, which suggests demand for workers has eased. In concert with that, wage growth is moderating. Rank-and-file leisure and hospitality workers are making 14.9% more than a year ago, but wage gains in that sector have dropped or held steady for three straight months. ""While quitting is still elevated and wage gains are still elevated, a lot of the particularly advantageous situation those workers were in summer 2021 has faded a bit,"" Mr. Bunker said. Quit rates returning to normal would be consistent with prepandemic trends. In the decades before the pandemic, young and low-wage workers, whose job tenures are typically shorter than older and higher-paid workers, generally saw their tenure lengthen. A study [https://www-minneapolisfed-org.proxy.library.nyu.edu/research/institute-working-papers/changing-stability-in-us-employment-relationships-a-tale-of-two-tails] by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis found that a set of workers that started their careers in 1979 held an average of 3.9 jobs between the ages of 22-30. A comparable 1997 cohort held an average of 3.5 jobs between those ages. This leads some economists to question whether workers in low-wage jobs have gained much that will help them in the long term other than wage gains that are partially diluted by high inflation. ""There's a lot of movement because the thought is that the grass is greener on the other side,"" said Kathryn A. Edwards, an economist at Rand Corp. ""There's movement but not progress."" The Minneapolis study did find that such workers reported increasing job security. But that may not have been unambiguously positive. The study found that those same workers reported low confidence in finding another job: In other words, they were staying in their current job longer because the opportunities for a better one weren't presenting themselves. That lack of movement probably held back their incomes: during periods of wage growth, gains by job-switchers nearly always outpace those of workers who stay in their jobs, according to Atlanta Fed data. A return to longer, prepandemic tenure wouldn't, on its own, benefit workers, if stability at jobs wasn't tied to job satisfaction and some disadvantages of such work, such as unpredictable schedules [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/a-little-noticed-reason-workers-quit-too-little-work-11646061707] and lackluster benefits, persist. Indeed, during the pandemic some workers [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/tech-jobs-no-college-degree-necessary-11649371535] reaped greater benefits from switching jobs by moving to long-term, white-collar roles, mainly with technology companies or in jobs that require some tech skills inside other types of firms. As a result, some economists say improving the lot of low-wage workers in a lasting way means easing the pathway to industries and occupations where not only is tenure longer, but that also allow for career development and advancement. ""One promising step in this direction would be for employers to relax some of the college credential requirements that have proliferated even for traditionally noncollege jobs in office work, manufacturing, and even construction,"" wrote Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist David Autor in a recent paper [https://econofact.org/the-shrinking-share-of-middle-income-jobs?utm_source=EconoFact Subscribers&utm_campaign=b7298224b4-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_05_21_01_21_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_ec9f988e33-b7298224b4-&utm_source=EconoFact Subscribers&utm_campaign=ca0f0a8f2c-Shrinking Middle-Income Jobs - Autor (memo)&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_ec9f988e33-ca0f0a8f2c-104633765] about how to reverse the declining availability of middle-income jobs, the sort that workers tend to stay at for much longer than ones in the low-wage service sector.

After finishing their interviews, they would rush to the store to develop photos.""The store enjoyed an ideal location and developed high-quality photos,"" a senior photographer recalled.However, it now mainly attracts senior and middle-aged shutterbugs at a time when almost everyone is taking photos with their mobile phones or digital cameras.Despite the closures and adjustments of the old brands, the most popular landmark of Shanghai was still crowded with tourists and citizens on Wednesday. Many came to take nostalgic photos or have a last look at the sites which brought back bittersweet memories.After noticing the former popular food stores had been shut down, many old customers rushed to their temporary site, a bazaar normally selling foreign products displayed at the China International Import Expo.The bazaar to run through early June is open from 9am and 10pm daily. Though the space has largely shrunk, the old brands are presenting their signature products.Sanyang Food Store, which sells nanhuo, or southern Chinese delicacies, is showcasing the commonest local delicacies. Meat counters are piled high with poultry and hunks of Jinhua ham, along with dried, marinated and preserved meats, poultry, seafood and vegetables.According to the renovation plan, these food stores will be redecorated to mainly promote wanghong, or the Internet sensation food products, in future. The night economy, scientific installations and immersive exhibitions will be highlighted in the stores.Renovation has also started on the iconic Century Plaza on Nanjing Road to drive the commercial upgrade.""As the pedestrian street has been extended to the Bund, the plaza near its center requires a new look to keep luring visitors from across the world,"" the Huangpu government said.After the 250-million yuan (US$39.55 million) makeover, the plaza will include a main structure known as the ""magic kaleidoscope,"" a greenery sightseeing hill and a shell-like square. At night, the main structure will be illuminated to look like a shining pearl in its shell, according to the design from a Spanish team.Upon its completion by the end of 2022, the plaza will have larger space to host a greater variety of events, while offering a leisure spot for tourists and locals. Global brands on the road will be invited to release their new products there, officials said.The total sales of the pedestrian mall exceeded 10 billion yuan last year, making it one of the most lucrative commercial hubs in the city.Nanjing Road was constructed in 1851 as Park Lane from the Bund to a race track on todays Henan Road. It was extended to Zhejiang Road in 1854 before being further stretched to Xizang Road in 1862. Nanjing Road E. was converted to a pedestrian street and unveiled to the public on the evening of September 20, 1999, when it quickly became an attraction for tourists and local residents alike.The walking street has been listed by the Ministry of Commerce as one of Chinas first batch of pedestrian roads to receive high-quality, tasteful renovations and improvements. The entire road is now covered by 5G, the next generation of mobile communication technology, a key factor in its future development.  *Click Here to View Image*[https://obj.shine.cn/files/2022/03/09/e147097d-ef3d-4dce-966a-57917ffd33bb_0.jpg]"

But this virus hits elderly people hard ï¿½?and this also includes your biological age due to underlying medical conditions. So this is a scary time, and I completely feel for everyone in the same boat as me how scary this is.?I remember back to catching the flu in November last year ï¿½?I thought I was going to stop breathing. I couldnât cough to clear my lungs as the level of my injury is right at the nerves which go to the lungs.? It knocked me out for weeks, so I would be lying if I said I wasnât slightly scared of Covid-19 and its possible effects on my lungs.? I am a very optimistic person who always looks for solutions over problems. But I must admit this has got me a little bit shaken.? Watching whatâs happening in Italy has been hard to believe ï¿½?particularly as life seemed to be continuing almost as normal here.? I looked at the MRI of a 44-year-old manâs lungs and it was unbelievable, unfortunately he didnât survive.? So I am staying positive but also taking advice from Austrian neurologist Viktor Frankl.?He speaks of acceptance of your current situation. These are his own words ï¿½?which I have had on my wall for the last four years: âThe meaning of life lies in finding a purpose and taking responsibility for ourselves and other human beings.ï¿½? In other words, by having a clear âwhyï¿½?we can face all the âhowï¿½?questions of life. This has got me through all those hours in hospital and continues to serve me daily.? Thereâs a reason that in-flight safety presentations always instruct us to secure our own oxygen masks before assisting fellow passengers. We canât help others effectively unless we first protect ourselves. So I spoke with a medical oncologist friend and they advised me to self-isolate.? I am now on day four and thinking this could be a long road ahead; thankfully the weather is getting warmer and I got out on my bike for a few laps of Richmond Park. Along with indoor turbo sessions I am well prepared mentally for the process. I guess all my time in hospital equipped my mind to deal with self-isolating. It also probably helps being an introvert.? I canât help but think of the poor people undergoing their cancer treatment right now though, as I prepare for my own hospital appointment in a few weeks, but I am grateful that side of things is under control. My main goal is keeping my immune system strong because another issue I have from my spinal-cord injury is a compromised immune system, thus moving me into a vulnerable group.? Itâs hard to go from a strong athlete to now feeling so vulnerable, but thankfully I have a strong mind."

While jet fuel prices are revised on the 1st and 16th of every month, petrol and diesel rates are revised daily based on equivalent rates in the international market. The increase in ATF price comes on back of the steepest ever hike of 18.3% (ï¿½?7,135.63 per kl) effected on March 16 and a 2% (ï¿½?,258.54 per kl) increase on April 1.

Fuel rates have been increased in India because energy prices globally have risen on back of supply concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and demand returning after being hit by the pandemic. India is 85% dependent on imports to meet its oil needs. Jet fuel, which makes up for almost 40% of the running cost of an airline, has this year surged to new highs.

962,1,B Corp certification can show youâre A-grade,910 words,thetimes.co.uk,"This has evolved to encompass corporate social responsibility, fair and equal pay, environmental sustainability, carbon neutrality, diversity and inclusion. But the expectations and requirements ï¿½?legislative, customer and employee ï¿½?continue to grow. I realised the sea change in 2020 when I gave a Â£2.5 million pitch to a blue-chip client based purely on our company values instead of best value for money. While our culture has always helped us attract good people to work for us, our values are now helping us win and retain business. We have always tried to be a âgoodï¿½?business. When we structured our acquisition of Ground Control in 2004, we created a partnership where leaders in the company were also shareholders and issued share options for every employee, believing that employees should share in the businessâs success. To date, weâve released Â£20 million to our employee-shareholders. We were also hyper-focused on customer and staff retention. If you take care of your people and customers, the profits will follow. A few years later, we got also serious about environmental sustainability, buying only green energy and introducing hybrid and electric vehicles into our fleet. Today weâre carbon-neutral and are well on the way to carbon net-zero. But how do you know itâs really working? A few weeks ago, our company received B Corporation certification, joining a growing cohort of businesses pursuing purpose as well as commercial success. We were certified by B Lab, the not-for-profit organisation behind the B Corp movement, as having met rigorous social and environmental standards. Weâve joined 700 B Corp businesses in the UK and 4,800 in 79 countries and 153 industries. B Corps include such well-known brands such as Innocent, Patagonia, The Body Shop and Abel & Cole. The certification addresses all our operations and covers five key impact areas: governance, workers, community, environment and customers. The process is painstaking. We had to provide evidence of socially and environmentally responsible practices relating to energy supplies, waste and water use, worker compensation, diversity and corporate transparency. To complete the certification, we had to legally embed our commitment to purpose beyond profit in our company articles. So why did we do it and what will we gain? I think the answer can be summarised as the following: ï¿½?Certification provides a structure and framework that helps us make decisions, gives us clear objectives beyond environmental sustainability and helps us to work out what we measure. ï¿½?It makes us think about things we hadnât spent enough time on, such as transparency with all our stakeholders, sustainable employment, and our responsibility to our wider supply chain. ï¿½?It assesses whether we are actually following the processes we think we have in place. Just because we have said we should do something, or have done it once, doesnât mean it is still happening. It forces us to look at what is actually happening and identify gaps. It also forces us to document our policies and processes, which is vital as we grow. ï¿½?Some of its requirements are things we should have been doing anyway. For example, we had previously discussed paying the real living wage, but made the commitment when we started working towards becoming a B Corp. ï¿½?It has also helped us examine diversity in the business. Good businesses focus on all types of diversity and representation, especially in leadership and management. Certification was a really extensive process: we started in June 2020 and became a B Corp in March of this year. The assessment varies depending on the size and activities your business is involved in but covers around 200 questions. The annual cost is based on turnover ï¿½?it ranges from Â£1,000 to Â£50,000 ï¿½?so is really achievable for smaller companies but still affordable for larger businesses. I would encourage every company to complete the organisationâs online self-assessment tool even if you donât follow through to full accreditation. It will highlight the easy wins and those areas where you are underperforming, and can support good decision-making within any business. Being a B Corp means you can demonstrate your authentic difference: that you are not just paying lip service to corporate social responsibility or being green. It supports staff retention and improves recruitment, helps you engage with clients who are aligned to your vision and values, and is in tune with todayâs refocusing on people and planet-based performance, not exploitation to make profit. B Corp is also a really active community and you can access lots of benchmarks, ideas and advice ï¿½?maybe even leading to new business opportunities. Kim Morrish is an owner and director of Ground Control, based in Billericay, Essex. Kim and her fellow directors Simon Morrish and Martin Leuw are sharing their experience of trying to double the size of the business to Â£250 million in sales over the next four years while keeping sustainability at the core of what they do."
826,1,Maha sees over 17 pc rise in sale of IMFL in 2021-22,396 words,Press Trust of India,"In 2021-22, the department earned Rs 17,177 crore, which is almost Rs 2,000 crore more than the previous financial year when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the state, the official said. In 2019-20 (pre-COVID-19 period), over 2,100 lakh bulk litres of IMFL were sold, which came down to 1,999.25 lakh bulk litre in 2020-21, he said. However, 2021-22, saw an increase in the sale of IMFL, as the state excise department registered 2,358.60 lakh bulk litre foreign liquor in IMFL category, he said. ""The reason for the drop in the sale of IMFL in 2020-21 is attributed to the pandemic and subsequent lockdown. However, as the COVID-19 situation in 2021-22 post-July started improving, the sale of IMFL picked up,"" the official said. In terms of revenue, there has been an increase of 13 per cent as the total revenue earned in the overall liquor sale (IMFL, country liquor, beer and wine) in 2021-22 was Rs 17,177.19 crore compared to Rs 15,078.25 crore. As far as the sale of beer, country liquor and wine are concerned in 2021-22, there was an increase of 14.95 per cent, 8.57 per cent and 21.75 per cent respectively, the data stated. Ganesh Shetty, the president of Pune Hoteliers Association, said that since things are getting back to normal, clientele is also increasing and the sale of liquor has seen an increase in the last few months. ""Since the COVID-19 situation is ebbing, there has been an increase in the footfall at hotels. People are now coming out and socialising. Once the work from the office starts 100 per cent, we expect more people coming to bars and restaurants,"" he said. PTI SPK ARU ARU"
109,1,$20bn implosion: Afterpayâs bubble bursts,1082 words,The Australian - Online,"In WeWorkâs case the âsomeoneï¿½?was private investors, specifically Japanese tech investor SoftBank, pushing the start-upâs valuation to $US47bn ($63.5bn). For Australiaâs Afterpay, which was valued at $39bn in August, the âsomeoneï¿½?was Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter and now head of the payments play now called Block. The share-based acquisition of Afterpay last August signalled top of the market for buy now, pay later, and had Block investors waited a few months as interest rates started climbing around the world, they would have got a bargain. Rising competition, interest rates and inflation are taking their toll on the one-time darlings. At the time of the Afterpay deal, the buyout ï¿½?which was funded by using 0.375 Block shares ï¿½?was valued at $39bn, marking Australiaâs biggest ever M&A deal. The equivalent transaction today would have valued Afterpay at $18.3bn, as Blockâs shares fell more than 56 per cent after it was announced. It is arguable that had the merger been struck a few months later, Block could have used tougher terms, resulting in an even lower valuation. In February the smaller Zip Co snapped up BNPL rival Sezzle for $491m, struck on numbers nowhere near the lofty Afterpay deal. Today that all-share Sezzle merger is worth just $239.4m Updated accounts released by the Wall Street-listed Block in recent days put Afterpay in a different light under its new San Francisco-based owner. The merger has triggered tougher accounting treatment and forced a string of revaluations. Itâs also given an insight into the deepening losses of the BNPL pioneer. Consolidated accounts show Afterpay delivered a pre-tax loss of $501.9m for the six months to end-December. This compares to a $76.1m pre-tax loss for the same period a year earlier.  Afterpayâs revenue increased 54 per cent during the half to $644.9m. But all the gains in revenue were wiped out by a bigger increase in operating costs, including a more-than-doubling of expenses ($176.7m) for bad debts during the December half. Itâs worth noting for all of last financial year ï¿½?that is for the entire 12 months ï¿½?Afterpay took $194.9m in bad debt expenses, showing momentum for lending losses is on the rise. As interest rates increase rapidly around the world this is going to deliver a twin blow for BNPL. Financing costs and bad debts are set to go up sharply, increasing the cash burn rate of the businesses. As weâve written before, one of the major issues with the BNPL model comes down to sustainability: the faster the growth, the bigger the losses become. And Afterpay and its smaller rival Sezzle are the most vulnerable because their revenue mostly relies on merchant fees for revenue. Comparable rivals Affirm and Klarna generate significant net interest income, which can help them navigate higher rates. The Block accounts reveal National Australia Bank and Citi have provided the biggest line of credit to Afterpay, with a combined $1.9bn in warehousing facilities in Australia alone to fund its BNPL payments. In the US Wall Street banks Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have a combined $1bn. This includes a $266m facility that needs to be rolled over in December. Block was at pains to point out that the unaudited results to end-December were presented for informational purposes only and are not intended to be indicative of the actual financial position of Â­Afterpay. A different business But itâs a picture of a very different business from 12 months ago. As long as Blockâs shareholders can handle the losses, merging with a pure-play payments business was actually the lifeline that Afterpay needed. The rationale remains to incorporate Afterpay into Blockâs Seller and Cash App, essentially becoming the payments link between merchants and consumers. This could ultimately represent bigger value to Block shareholders rather than operating Afterpay as a stand-alone business, but it will require deep pockets. Itâs just as well Jack Dorsey resigned from the microblogging site last November to focus his efforts on Block, which he jointly ran. Otherwise he would have his work cut out fending off a $US43bn takeover approach for Twitter from Tesla founder Elon Musk, rather than bringing Afterpay together. Dorsey remains on the board of Twitter, which is weighing up Muskâs approach. Brokerage Macquarie has been tracking the BNPL sector for some time and is now starting to see plenty of red flags, particularly around the rates of growth for the sector. One measure that Macquarie tracks includes website visits, which is a key driver of customers signing up. Total web traffic across six major BNPL players, including Afterpay, fell during March from the same time a year earlier ï¿½?the first time that growth has fallen. The outlook for web traffic growth remains uncertain as inflation flows through markets, which could dampen spending and potentially BNPL transactions. At the same time Afterpay has been showing slower merchant growth globally, which âmay be a leading indicator the industry is beginning to matureï¿½? Macquarie says. Itâs almost a year since the talks between Jack Dorsey and Afterpayâs co-founders began. From May 17 there were two days of talks with the Block boss and his payments executives Brian Grassadonia and Alyssa Henry. Molnar attended the talks in person in San Francisco while Eisen participated by videoconferences. The talks included an outline of the future of both companies and were left at a point where Block needed to conduct preliminary due diligence before pushing ahead with a deal. It was at this meeting that Molnar and Eisen agreed to remain with Block, leading the payments business if a deal went ahead. Terms of a deal and due diligence were settled in just two months. By holding on just a few months longer would have seen a very different outcome in valuation. As it stands the one time buy now, pay later darling will have to start delivering for Dorsey. johnstone@theaustralian.com.au"
159,1,Ecuador - Institutions and Energy Policy - Oil,253 words,Global Energy Research,"Following the drop-in oil price in 2008 and the fall in investments, E&P contracts were switched from a windfall profit tax system to a fee-based system in 2010. Under these new contracts, the contractor receives a fixed fee per barrel to cover capital & operational expenditures, plus a return; that fixed fee is negotiated individually with the contractor. However, this system caused a fall in upstream investments, so, in July 2018, the government issued a decree that restores the production-sharing contracts. Since 2005, the country has preferred to rely on Petroamazonas to develop oil production rather than turn to foreign companies. A significant share of oil production was committed to China through Chinese oil-for-loans (US$4bn of Chinese loans signed between 2009 and 2011). Ecuador, which re-joined OPEC in 2007 after having withdrawn its membership in 1992, left the organization again in January 2020 to increase its oil production. Last Updated: 20210401"
432,0,The iconic lasagna you can only get in Boston,907 words,The Boston Globe,"But, he told us the dish was inspired by spending time with his daughter. âMy daughter and I were reading through the works of Hans Christian Andersen, and it started out as an ode to 'The Princess and the Pea,' so it started as a 20-layer affair, and then just grew from there,ï¿½?he explained. The mighty dish ended up on Del Posto's restaurant's menu, where it made quite a splash, with New York Magazine calling it âClassic comfort food, refined and redefined.ï¿½?Now Ladner has brought his high-caliber, incredibly comforting dish to Bar Enza, which is inside the Charles Hotel. Ladner, who grew up in Belmont, was ready for a change from Manhattan, saying simply, âI just like being back here, close to my family, and such and such and such. I spent almost 30 years in Manhattan and just was done.ï¿½?If you've been lucky enough to try the dish before, or maybe spotted it on Bar Enza's extremely appetizing Instagram account, you know you're in for a treat. Ladner has made a few changes though, based on a smaller kitchen and the bounty of ingredients he has at his fingertips in New England. âEven though it's built the same here as it was at Del Posto, it's served quite differently. It's much larger, it's baked rather than seared,ï¿½?he explained. âI just wanted to mix it up, but also use working within the limitations of the kitchen I have here. I went from 70 cooks to seven, so it's a very different operation.ï¿½?Ladner told us he's getting his pasta for the layers of lasagna from a local company that makes incredible fresh pasta. âWe buy it from this company in Lynn called Durum, which is the best fresh pasta I've been able to find since I moved here,ï¿½?Ladner said. âI was here maybe six months before we opened, so I had a lot of time to re-acclimate with the surrounding culinary scene and such. I struck up an agreement with the guy that owns the company, Al, and he basically makes a dough for me that's to my specifications. He just delivers the dough and then we roll it out.ï¿½?The filling for the lasagna isn't what you'd expect, with the sauce being cooked for a short period of time to maintain a lighter flavor. âIt's really fruity because the marinara is not cooked very long. I thicken it with tomato paste to get the viscosity of a sauce that's been cooked for a long time, but it still tastes fresh and fruity because it's only cooked for about 30 minutes,ï¿½?the chef explained. As for the cheese? That's a process too, because lasagna this good needs lots of love, and a cream sauce to layer in, says Ladner, âThen we make a Besciamella, and I thicken the Besciamella with fresh mozzarella. It becomes this really stringy glue, if you will. We take those three components and just alternate them and build up this lasagna.ï¿½?But the thing that makes this dish different from any lasagna you may have tried before? It's not actually baked as a whole dish, it's cooked by the portion and that's how you get the perfect crispy top with the gooey inside. âWe build it to about 4 inches high and then we put another sheet tray on top of it and we weigh it overnight. It becomes a solid block with the cheese acting as the glue,ï¿½?the chef explained, âThen we cut it while it's cold into portions. We put it in a casserole with more sauce and cheese and then bake it for between 20 and 25 minutes.ï¿½?The dish is vegetarian, but can be served with a side of ragu alla bolognese for a more meaty take, or get the marinara because extra sauce is always a good thing. And if a pound of lasagna (yes, it's around a full pound) isn't your thing, Ladner told us Bar Enza has created a giant meatball, called Meatball Chianti, in partnership with Andy Husbands' Smoke Shop BBQ. Husbands and Ladner went to culinary school together, and the meatball is made with, among other things, âspiced and smoked pork shoulder and beef brisketï¿½?from Husbands. Yesterday's 100-Layer Lasagna $30 (add ragu alla bolognese for $5 more) at Bar Enza, Cambridge."

There were a number of factors that went into this decision. Our lease is expiring soon, the Hotel [Buckminster] has closed its doors, the Red Sox aren't playing and this restaurant thrives on those fans as well as the students at BU.

Originally built in the 1920s, the substation has been in continual use with investments and maintenance. This $10 million upgrade project will take the substation offline for a thorough rebuild. âThis project includes improving the aesthetics of the substation, located in a well-used park in our community,ï¿½?said NorthWestern Energy Community Relations Manager Steve Clawson. âA new solid masonry wall that complements the exteriors of existing buildings in the area will surround the upgraded substation.

Fabrice Rosset, head of the Deutz brand, told Le Monde ""the euphoria is even more marked this year"" than in 1999 when there was a ""frenetic atmosphere"" as people celebrated.

931,0,The photo that puts Australia to shame: Weatherman Tim Bailey reveals he got a $4 rapid antigen test with his meal at a RESTAURANT in Thailand - as Aussies struggle to find tests and prices soar amid Omicron,473 words,Mail Online,"Even if a resident does manage to find a RAT, they still may not be able to afford it due to the high cost of the products. Bailey, 57, is currently holidaying in Thailand with his wife Samantha, and on Tuesday revealed he'd purchased an antigen test with his dinner at a restaurant in Phuket for just $4. Uploading a photograph of his meal and the test, the former Channel 10 star wrote: 'So which country is winning? A brilliant meal in Nai Harn, Phuket, Thailand - and RAT selling for $4 at the same restaurant.' 'Who is winning and who is losing Australia? #ashamed,' he raged. After weeks of pharmacies being stripped bare of rapid antigen tests and Australians having to wait up to eight hours in line for a PCR test, Prime Minister Scott Morrison finally agreed to provide free test kits last week - but only to low-income or vulnerable Australians. Some retailers were reportedly selling the hard-to-find tests for as much as $100 each - with some splitting bulk testing kits and selling them individually for a much higher price. The astronomical increase prompted the government to introduce new laws to hold retailers accountable and punish them with $66,000 fines if they are caught selling RATs for more than 20 per cent of the supply price. Despite the new regulations the cheapest testing kit costs around $12 - meaning residents can still be left out of pocket, especially if they have to travel for work and frequently get tested. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has been widely criticised for his insistence that tests 'can't just be made free', despite handing out $89 billion in JobKeeper payments to businesses. Providing universally free rapid antigen tests makes economic sense as asymptomatic cases are detected earlier, flattening the curve, new analysis suggests.  Flinders University health economists on Friday said their modelling suggested five times as many asymptomatic positive cases would begin isolating early if RATs were freely available. 'By making rapid antigen tests free, you can encourage people to test earlier before they have symptoms,' lead author Professor Jon Karnon told AAP. 'If you haven't got a rapid antigen test, then people are less likely to test before they have symptoms. By the time they have symptoms, they could have passed COVID-19 onto many people.'"
320,0,"More than 17,000 chain outlets including retailers, restaurants, bars and banks closed across UK last year, figures show",845 words,Mail Online,"* Since 2019, the number of new shop openings has plummeted by 26 per cent * Shopping centres dropped to the worst performing locations in 2020 and 2021 More than 17,000 chain outlets including restaurants, retailers and banks closed down last year, according to new figures. There was a net decline of 10,059 last year after 17,219 chain store branches closed, compared with just 7,160 openings, according to PwC data compiled by the Local Data Company (LDC). The net change was worse last year when compared with 2020, but the number of closures per day remained steady, with 47 in 2021, compared with 48 the year before - when store closures peaked as the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Although the data reflects a rise in online shopping, it also suggests more vacant spaces are instead being taken on by independent retail and leisure businesses, rather than chain branches. The LDC tracked 203,719 chain outlets, run by firms with more than 5 outlets, across the UK's high streets, shopping centres and retail parks between January 1 and December 31, 2021. The research looked at chain retailers, restaurants, bars and takeaways, as well as gyms, banks and hairdressers. Since 2019, the last year before the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of shop openings has plummeted by 26 per cent, while many of the new shop openings in 2021 were re-siting of existing stores. Apart from takeaways and government job centres, no other category saw more than 20 net openings across 2021, according to the data. Fashion was the fastest declining category with almost four net closures a day, with some of the retail chains instead being taken on by online operators. After several years of slowing down closures, banks accelerated their closure programmes during the pandemic, with a net closure of 1000, compared with just 413 in 2020. The charity sector was also hit by the closures as it saw a net decline of 557 last year, according to the findings. Retail parks, clusters of shops located on the outskirts of towns, outperformed shopping centres and high streets for the sixth year, becoming even more popular during the pandemic due to easy access and parking facilities. Meanwhile, shopping centres have dropped from the second best performing location in 2015 to the worst performing locations in 2020 and 2021. According to the findings, city centres and London postcodes have seen an acceleration in net closures, as more people are working from home. While retail businesses have been struck by closures, takeaway chains saw a rise in delivery and walk-in demand during 2020. Commenting on the findings, Lisa Hooker, consumer markets lead at PwC, said: 'The last two years have been tumultuous for retailers but the closures we've seen are an acceleration of what was happening before the pandemic. 'Changes in consumer behaviour, changing patterns of working and the shift to online is impacting on both retail and service chain operators. 'Location matters most to consumers and whilst city centres and shopping centres falter, retail parks and standalone operators have broad appeal. Multiple operators are taking note of this changing consumer behaviour and are relocating stores to where their customers need them to be.' Ms Hooker argued that there is a 'pressing need' to 'reshape and even repurpose' town and city centres amid store closures, which have led to more vacant shopfronts. She added: 'To regain lost footfall, high streets must understand why retail parks are so attractive to consumers or look for ways to better serve local needs, encouraging independent retailers and entrepreneurs to take this opportunity to grow into the gaps that are emerging.'  Lucy Stainton, commercial director at The Local Data Company, said that she hopes 2021 marked the 'end of the worst of the structural decline in chain retail exacerbated by the pandemic'. She added: '2021 was an extremely challenging period for occupiers, with the first three months lost to a strict lockdown, limitations on international travel impacting tourism, increased migration to online retailing, mobility restricted across all sectors and continuing home working impacting city centres. 'There is no doubt that the numbers are stark and 2021 saw an acceleration in net closures across this sector, which in isolation looks dramatic. 'However, it's also worth noting that vacancy rates have started to stabilise across the market, meaning that the number of empty shops is no longer increasing. 'This is due to a significant uptick in independent retail and leisure businesses opening sites in units left vacant by chains.' Ms Stainton argued that independent operators are 'potentially the chains of tomorrow' as the businesses gain momentum, insisting that the findings did not point to 'the death of the high street' but a 'shakeout' of 'heritage brands'."
666,1,U.S. Retail Sales Climb 0.5% Amid Spike In Gas Station Sales,374 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"Economists had expected retail sales to increase by 0.6 percent compared to the 0.3 percent uptick originally reported for the previous month. The retail sales growth came as sales by gas stations skyrocketed by 8.9 percent amid the recent surge in gasoline prices. Excluding the spike in gas station sales, retail sales dipped by 0.3 percent. Meanwhile, the report showed sales by motor vehicle and parts dealers slumped by 1.9 percent in March after jumping by 1.5 percent in February. Excluding the pullback in auto sales, retail sales jumped by 1.1 percent in March after rising by 0.6 percent in February. Ex-auto sales were expected to increase by 1.0 percent. Along with the spike in sales by gas stations, the ex-auto sales growth reflected notably higher sales by general merchandise stores, sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument, and book stores, electronics and appliance stores and clothing and accessories stores. On the other hand, the report showed sales by non-store retailers plunged by 6.4 percent in March after tumbling by 3.5 percent in February. Closely watched core retail sales, which exclude automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, edged down by 0.1 percent in March after falling by 0.9 percent in February. ""The surge in consumer prices means that consumption fell again last month in real terms, by 0.2% or so,"" said Andrew Hunter, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics. ""While that would still leave growth over the first-quarter as a whole at close to 3.5% annualized, it provides a weak starting point for the second quarter."" He added, ""More generally, although the energy price-related hit to real incomes may unwind over the coming months, we expect slowing employment growth to keep consumption growth relatively subdued."""

Shake Shack forecast first-quarter revenue of $196 million to $201.4 million, compared with analysts' average estimate of $210.9 million, according to Refinitiv IBES. ""We saw a more acute impact on SHAK sales from Omicron than its more geographically diversified peers ... expectations were just too optimistic and underestimated the Omicron impact,"" M Science analyst Matthew Goodman said. Rising paper and food expenses as well as labor costs have also put a squeeze on Shake Shack's margins. Credit Suisse analysts noted the company's margin forecast was also below consensus estimates. To protect its margins, Shake Shack will jack up prices in March and increase its third-party delivery menu prices, Garutti said. The company in October raised prices by 3% to 3.5%. Nearly every U.S. restaurant, including Chipotle Mexican Grill and McDonald's, has also raised prices. In the fourth quarter ended Dec. 29, same-store sales in Shake Shack's urban restaurants, which account for over half of its topline, declined 4% as many city dwellers moved to suburbs during the pandemic. However, that helped comparable sales at suburban restaurants gain 9%.  Shake Shack also pointed to a sales improvement in recent days, with monthly comparable sales through Feb. 15 jumping 13%, versus a 2% rise last month.

85,1,$1 billion in the green; Government report shows auto insurance firms made more money than they paid in 2020,845 words,The Calgary Sun,"NDP energy critic Kathleen Ganley said Friday that insurance companies are making hundreds of millions more off the backs of Alberta drivers with the help of UCP policies. Premier Jason Kenney scrapped a rate increase cap on auto insurers in 2019 after it was imposed by the previous NDP government. ""They were able to do this because the UCP removed the cap we put in place to limit increases to premiums,"" said Ganley. ""That's $385 million more out of the pockets of Alberta drivers in a single year. No wonder the UCP tried to hide the report before we called them out on it. No wonder they tried to bury it ahead of a long weekend."" The NDP has accused the government of attempting to suppress the superintendent's report for 2020 and 2021, which have been produced for more than 100 years. Ganley said the increases came during a year when many people parked their vehicles due to the pandemic and hardly drove. Despite that, they still saw rate increases, she said. ""Alberta drivers, when you look at your car insurance bill, remember that you are getting worked over by an extremely profitable corporation with the help of the UCP,"" said Ganley. Kassandra Kitz, press secretary to Finance Minister Travis Toews, said that since much of the information in the report is publicly available elsewhere, the office of the superintendent had paused the release of the annual document while assessing if the report was still necessary. ""They have since taken action to continue the annual report publication,"" said Kitz in an email. Kitz said Albertans deserve an automobile insurance system that is fair, accessible and affordable and that is why the government is committed to examining ways to improve that system. She noted the government introduced Bill 41, the Insurance Amendment Act, which changed regulations around how premiums are calculated. ""We introduced Bill 41 last session that made legislative and regulatory changes to stabilize auto insurance rates, enhance medical care benefits and ensure more options and flexibility for drivers,"" said Kitz. She said seven insurers have filed for rate reductions in 2021 and that across the board, premium rates for private vehicles are down by just under one per cent over the past 12 months. An analysis using industry and regulator data before the report was released Thursday suggested insurance companies had raked in nearly $2.1 billion in profits during the COVID-19 pandemic. An analysis done by actuary Craig Allen that he says is based on figures provided by the Alberta Automobile Insurance Rate Board shows auto insurers in 2020 pocketed $928 million in pre-tax profits and another $1.153 billion the following year. The 2021 figure, said Allen, is based on available numbers for the first half of that year and projections for the remainder. ""My estimate of what the profit's going to be is fairly conservative, cautious,"" he said. ""The COVID-19 pandemic and reduction in traffic certainly through the first half of 2021 that reduced the volume of accidents and claims is the real main driver."" The analysis was conducted for the group Fair Alberta, which includes lawyers, medical professionals and injured Albertans. An insurance industry spokesman echoed the nearly one per cent rate decrease cited by Kitz, adding Allen's numbers are incomplete and skewed. He said it doesn't include more than $100 million in vehicle damage claims from the June 2020 hailstorm that ravaged northeast Calgary and more vehicular traffic and probably more eventual payouts in the second half of last year. ""It's inappropriate to take a point in time and extrapolate it for an entire year ... it's not necessarily accurate,"" said Aaron Sutherland, vice-president of the Insurance Bureau of Canada. He said it's illegal for insurance company profits to exceed seven per cent so ""the notion we're making any kind of windfall is fanciful."" With inflation running at nearly six per cent and price increases of car parts and used vehicles far exceeding that, ""we're seeing a lot of pressure on pocketbooks but auto insurance isn't one of them."" He agreed many insurers'financial picture has improved recently but that some companies are doing considerably better than others. dshort@postmedia.com @dylanshort_ bkaufmann@postmedia.com @BillKaufmannjrn"

901,1,"Israeli startup Ception unveils new AI-based system to improve safety, productivity, and profitability of heavy equipment",1039 words,PR Newswire,"Equipment such as articulated trucks, haul trucks, loaders, bulldozers, and excavators, is involved in severe accidents on a daily basis. Accidents include collisions, overturning, and falling into chasms, costing lives, and damaging property. Moreover, operations without advanced technological equipment are inefficient, incurring heavy and unnecessary costs, and prolong the time needed to complete projects. MineCept - full situational awareness To tackle the heavy equipment challenges, Ception developed MineCept. The system is based on a SaaS business model, which offers the customer a collection of apps via the same hardware kit and supports a wide range of scenarios in the field. The system uses advanced real-time high-definition 3D mapping and precise positioning technology, based on visual feed rather than GPS, to provide full situational awareness of the machine's surrounding environment by cross-referencing information from different sensors and a range of image processing algorithms and deep learning. MineCept, which is installed on the heavy vehicles, provides operators, site managers and safety managers real-time information and insights to improve safety and operational efficiency in general. MineCept includes three parts. The first is a modular hardware kit that is easily installed on heavy equipment and is OEM-agnostic. It includes a compute unit, communications component, and sensors. The basic kit includes cameras with an option of adding Lidar and radar sensors based on the application and the user requirements. The second part is an assistance system for the machine's operator. It includes a display screen installed in the operator's cabin. This system provides visual and sound alerts, as well as support for different operational tasks. The third part is the site management system, which includes real-time information and insights about what is happening at the site. MineCept's management system obtains a comprehensive holistic picture of all the operational and safety parameters and summarizes the hazards (potholes, puddles, rocks, etc.) and events at the site for the manager in an accessible way. Above this level, the artificial intelligence tools provide insights and enable the forecasting of bottlenecks in the different processes and safety failure points before they occur (preventative safety). For example, if heavy vehicles or a heavy vehicle and a person get too close, an alarm is immediately sent to the operators so they can avoid a collision, or if a heavy equipment operator is momentarily distracted, causing him to go off the road or move in reverse towards a chasm, he will get a life-saving warning. The system contributes to streamlining operations by supporting diverse apps, such as performance monitoring, comparing planning to execution in the field, measuring the volume of stockpiles, and monitoring cycle times. At the same time, MineCept verifies that the site is operating in compliance with regulatory safety instructions, such as continuous measurement of the height of safety berms. Successful deployments Ception's system is used by leading mining and construction companies in various projects and industrial sites in Israel and over the globe. In the mining industry, MineCept is used by ICL Group, one of the world's leading fertilizers producers, which operates heavy equipment at its phosphate mine in southern Israel. In the field of construction and infrastructure, MineCept was used by Netivei Israel, the national transport infrastructure company, as a part of a project aimed at improving the safety and efficiency of heavy equipment. Ception has been selected the building materials giant Cemex as one of the top 50 startups in the construction technology sector. At the same time, Ception is collaborating with Cemex's Israeli subsidiary, Readymix Industries. The startup also won a recent workforce technologies competition, where leading construction companies such as Bouygues, Suffolk and Limak acted as judges, and will represent Israel in the global competition later this year. The company is in advanced negotiations for collaboration with one of Israel top construction companies. As part of the agreement, the building company will invest in Ception and deploy its systems in the company's heavy equipment. Solving acute safety, efficiency, and sustainability problems Tal Israel, Co-Founder and CEO of Ception, says, ""The construction, building materials, mining and quarrying industries are huge markets that suffer from acute safety, efficiency, and sustainability problems and are always looking for innovative solutions. There is currently a gap of technological solutions in this discipline. Some of the solutions are geared towards a high level of automation, but suffer from various barriers, including technological limitations, high prices, and regulatory restrictions. Conversely, solutions that rely on basic technologies do not offer an adequate response and suffer from serious reliability problems."" Israel concludes: ""The automation and Industry 4.0 revolutions have brought immense technological advances in edge computing, sensing technologies, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and other fields. Ception is not waiting for the automation revolution to be complete and is applying these innovative technologies to provide precise and reliable solutions at good prices."" About Ception Ception was founded in 2019 by CEO Tal Israel and CTO Yossi Buda, who have been working for almost 15 years in developing advanced driving systems and autonomous vehicle solutions at Israel Aerospace Industries and General Motors. In their last positions before founding the company, they headed the development of several unmanned ground vehicles and autonomous systems. To date, the company has received $7 million in funding, including seed funding from MoreVC and a grant from the Israel Innovation Authority. Images can be downloaded here.

785,0,Murdoch's News Corp hit by Chinese cyber attack,633 words,The Daily Telegraph,"Hackers sought to steal data from publications including The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post, as well as the UK company that owns The Times and The Sun, Mr Murdoch's business News Corp said. It comes after the tycoon's ex-wife, Wendi Deng Murdoch, was named by US intelligence officials in 2017 as a possible Chinese spy.  News Corp contacted US authorities and cyber security consultants Mandiant after discovering ""attack activity"" on several of its businesses on Jan 20. In an email to staff, David Kline, chief technology officer of News Corp, said: ""Our preliminary analysis indicates that foreign government involvement may be associated with this activity, and that some data was taken. ""Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus and believes they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests. ""We will not tolerate attacks on our journalism, nor will we be deterred from our reporting, which provides readers everywhere with the news that matters.""  News Corp said the attack had affected the business email accounts and documents of a ""limited number of employees"" inside its headquarters and across its news technology services, as well as The Journal owner Dow Jones, British division News UK and The New York Post. Financial information and user data does not appear to have been targeted, suggesting the hackers may have been seeking to access information on the work done by journalists - including details of their confidential sources. Mr Murdoch has courted Chinese leaders for the past two decades in the hope of expanding his satellite network in the nation. He bought Hong Kong-based Star TV for $1bn (Â£740m) in 1993 from the son of Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong tycoon who controls the UK mobile network Three through CK Hutchison. The media mogul is believed to have met Ms Deng Murdoch at the channel. But hopes of significant expansion were curtailed in 2005 when China's broadcast regulator toughened regulations to prevent overseas media companies from buying home-grown broadcasters, forcing News Corp to axe a joint venture with the domestic TV network Qinghai Satellite Television that cost the company a reported $50m. Three years ago, TheJournal reported that US security officials warned then-president Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner that Ms Deng Murdoch could be using her friendship with him to further the interests of the Chinese government. Mr Murdoch filed for divorce from Ms Deng Murdoch, his third wife, in 2013. In 2018 a spokesman for Ms Deng said she ""has no knowledge of any ... intelligence agency concerns relating to her or her associations"". Christopher Wray, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said on Thursday that America suffered more cyber attacks by China than all other nations combined. He said: ""The Chinese government steals staggering volumes of information and causes deep, job-destroying damage across a wide range of industries."" The announcement came as News Corp unveiled an extension to a multiyear agreement with Apple that builds on a previous partnership under which the iPhone maker pays for stories that appear on its news app.  News Corp said it expects the move to be ""an important source of subscription and advertising revenue"" for its web sites as revenues rose 13pc to a record $2.7bn for the last quarter of 2021. Profits also climbed 18pc over the period to $586m, buoyed by a sales bump across its news publishing arm from cash-for-content deals and an advertising rebound."
271,0,CHARLES RETURNS TO SKI RESORT WHERE CLOSE FRIEND WAS KILLED BY AVALANCHE; KATE MANSEY,286 words,Mail on Sunday,"Patti Palmer-Tomkinson, another member of the Royal ski party, suffered serious leg injuries, but the Prince and other members of the group were able to ski to safety before being airflifted off the mountain. Almost 34 years later, Charles "" who has recently recovered from a second bout of Covid "" was back in the resort. He had been scheduled to be off work last week, according to a source, but after his time in isolation decided to forfeit several days to catch up on work "" thus truncating his visit to Switzerland. Charles has long had a fondness for the privacy of upmarket Klosters and, despite the tragedy in 1988, has been a regular visitor. He was photographed there admiring the view across the Alps from a hotel balcony in 2015. On another occasion, he was seen wearing a disguise of glasses, a fake nose and moustache to avoid being spotted on the slopes. It was in Klosters in 2005 where, eight days before he wed Camilla, a TV mic picked up his unguarded comments about BBC Royal Correspondent Nicholas Witchell. The Prince, sitting with William and Harry, said: These bloody people. I cant bear that man. I mean, hes so awful. He really is. The BBC defended Mr Witchell at the time, with a spokesman saying: He is one of our finest."

916,0,MLL revenues plunged last year,645 words,Winnipeg Free Press,"âIt's safe to say that the impact of the pandemic to our gaming lines of business, specifically casinos, VLTs and some lottery, were the main reasons for the drop in net income,"" Atwal told a legislative committee Tuesday afternoon, during a virtual presentation on MLL's annual report. Atwal said casino operations lost nearly $70 million in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, as they were forced to close or significantly reduce operations for much of that time. The year prior, casinos generated about $56 million in revenue. Meanwhile, net income from video lotto terminals dropped by $127 million, resulting in a loss of more than $76 million in commissions for partner businesses. Atwal said some of the losses were made up by increased liquor and cannabis sales, which grew by about 13 per cent and 96 per cent, respectively. The Crown corporation also managed to find about $42 million in cost savings. MLL expects the number of cannabis retailers in the province to double, to about 150, by the end of this fiscal year. There was also a 200 per cent increase in business connected to MLL's online gaming platform, playnow.com, representing about $40 million more in revenue compared to last year. However, Atwal said many customers who would typically gamble at casinos or on VLTs in person have chosen to use âgrey market"" or illegal online gaming websites. He emphasized playnow.com is the only legal online gaming site in the province. He estimated the online gaming market in Manitoba could provide revenues between $70 million and $150 million to MLL annually; online gaming generated $51.8 million in revenues for the corporation in the last fiscal year. âToday, we're on the lower end of that,"" Atwal said. âWhich means a lot of that money leaves the province, a lot of that money leaves the country."" Atwal said MLL is competing with âthe best platforms in the world"" for Manitoba customers when it comes to online gambling, but the biggest hurdle tapping into the market has been brand recognition. âWe have to basically build that from scratch and really promote this product for Manitoba,"" the CEO said. âIt's as good as the best sites in the world, and our objective and our focus, for this fiscal and next as we go forwardï¿½?is to build the brand."" Meanwhile, the drinking habits of Manitobans have mostly returned to normal, after COVID-19 initially sparked panic buying and increased use of alcohol among some, Atwal said. âWhat we're seeing now isï¿½?our customers are telling us that (they) moved from an increase of one drink per weekï¿½?to where they were pre-pandemic,"" Atwal said. âAnd 38 per cent of our customers (say they) actually drink less."" MLL will also be downsizing its retail portfolio and selling off corporate offices in Winnipeg on Empress Street, Milt Stegall Drive and Buffalo Place, as employees move to a hybrid work-from-home model. âThe sale of Buffalo Place will provide us with a one-time pick up in net income, and then, with the lease back of the office space, we're able to reduce our costs as a company by over $1 million per year,"" Atwal said. MLL's current financial forecast predicts government revenues to return to pre-pandemic levels in the 2022-23 fiscal year. danielle.dasilva@freepress.mb.ca"
344,1,Amazon's New CEO Pledges To Improve Worker Safety,745 words,The Wall Street Journal,"""We spent Amazon's first 25 years building a very large fulfillment network, and then had to double it in the last 24 months to meet customer demand,"" Mr. Jassy said. He also noted the challenges of the labor shortage and supply-chain issues that led to higher costs. On employee safety, he said the company's injury rates were ""sometimes misunderstood"" but vowed to do better. ""We're not close to being done in how we improve the lives of our employees,"" Mr. Jassy said in the letter. He noted that the company identified ""the top 100 employee experience pain points"" and is working to try to solve them. ""We're also passionate about further improving safety in our fulfillment network, with a focus on reducing strains, sprains, falls, and repetitive stress injuries,"" he said. On the company's injury rates, he said incidents in its warehouses were slightly above Amazon's peers' average, and slightly lower than the company's peers' average in the courier and delivery business. He said those numbers put the company at about average compared with its peers, but that the company wants ""to be best in class."" ""When I first started in my new role, I spent significant time in our fulfillment centers and with our safety team, and hoped there might be a silver bullet that could change the numbers quickly,"" he added. ""I didn't find that."" Mr. Jassy took over Amazon from Mr. Bezos, the founder who is now executive chairman of the company. Mr. Bezos used to write annual shareholder letters since the company went public in 1997. The letters often highlighted the company's successes, usually told with a storytelling flourish. In a CNBC interview on Thursday, Mr. Jassy said he speaks to Mr. Bezos weekly. ""It's great to have a sounding board,"" he said. ""He has so much wisdom."" Mr. Jassy's comments about worker safety come as one of the company's warehouses in Staten Island, N.Y., recently voted to unionize.  Amazon said in a legal filing last week it intends to appeal the loss because of actions taken by the National Labor Relations Board and the Amazon Labor Union. ""It's [the] employees' choice whether or not they want to join a union,"" Mr. Jassy said on CNBC. ""We happen to think they're better off not doing so."" He noted employees tend to perform better when they have direct connections with their managers. ""If [employees] see something they can do better for customers or for themselves, they can go meet in a room, decide how to change it and change it,"" he said on CNBC. ""That type of empowerment doesn't happen when you have unions. It's much more bureaucratic, it's much slower."" While Amazon hired more than 300,000 workers last year, Mr. Jassy said on CNBC that the company still didn't have enough people in certain locations. Mr. Jassy also touched on the company's popular Prime business. He said that prior to the pandemic, Amazon had decided to put billions of incremental dollars over multiple years toward boosting the number of Prime packages it was delivering on a daily basis. ""This initiative was slowed by the challenges of the pandemic, but we've since resumed our focus here,"" Mr. Jassy said in his letter. Mr. Jassy in his letter also addressed Amazon's carbon footprint and said the company is making significant progress on its climate pledge to be net-zero carbon by 2040. He said Amazon is committed to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of the company's initial target.  Amazon reported in February that fourth-quarter earnings nearly doubled and revenue rose. Mr. Jassy at the time said the company's costs were higher over the holidays because of inflation and labor supply shortages.

That's why the stock's relative strength line[https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/] continues to hold near highs. PANW still has the potential to be a strong price performer in the group after a bullish move over the 600 level. PANW soared out of a consolidation in late February, but sellers quickly knocked the stock down to its 50-day moving average. But buyers came in and offered support, and PANW rallied back to new highs in heavy volume. At this point, it's best to wait for a pullback before buying PANW stock. When it does, watch for buyers to come in and support PANW at its 21-day exponential moving average. Shares jumped 18% during the week ended Feb. 25 after the company reported a 30% jump in revenue[https://www.investors.com/news/technology/panw-stock-rises-as-next-gen-product-growth-drives-earnings-beat/] to $1.32 billion.

""In Q2, our company continued to benefit from strength across our three security platforms, driven by strong cybersecurity demand, organizations architecting for hybrid work and growing their hyperscale cloud footprints,"" said Nikesh Arora, chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks. ""On the back of this strength, notably in our next-generation security offerings, we are raising our guidance for the year across revenue, billings and earnings per share.""

Composite Rating: 95 Latest-quarter EPS % change: +12% Latest-quarter sales % change: 30% Three-year annualized EPS growth rate: 21% Annual return on equity: 71% Up/down volume ratio: 1.6 PSTG Stock The company provides flash-based storage solutions for enterprise clients. Five straight quarters of accelerating revenue growth points to strong demand for the company's products. Shares gapped up and soared nearly 13% on March 3 after the company reported a 177% surge in quarterly profit. Revenue increased 41% to $708.6 million. Annual operating cash flow doubled to more than $400. CEO Charles Giancarlo said the company is no longer a niche player in the storage market, with strong growth among commercial, enterprise, government and cloud customers.  Pure Storage also added another $250 million to its current share repurchase program. When selling in the technology sector has fully run its course, Pure Storage has the potential be a new leader. PSTG gave a buy signal when it soared nearly 7% in heavy volume on March 17. It ran up to a high of 36.71 but selling pressure started to build in PSTG. Now, it's testing support at its 50-day moving average.  Pure Storage's next earnings report is due in late May. Composite Rating: 97 Latest-quarter EPS % change: +177% Latest-quarter sales % change: +41% Five-year annualized EPS growth rate: 40% Annual return on equity: 29% Up/down volume: 1.7 ZEN Stock There's still a lot of carnage in the enterprise software group, with many former leaders still far off their highs., but Zendesk has recovered nicely off lows amid renewed signs of accumulation.  Zendesk provides a cloud-based, customer service platform, allowing companies to communicate with its customers via various channels. Over the past eight quarters, revenue growth has ranged from 23% to 32%. In late February, activist investor Jana Partners asked Zendesk to institute significant board changes or a sale following ZEN's failed $4.1 billion bid for SurveyMonkey parent Momentive Global. The announcement came just two weeks after the Zendesk spurned a $17 billion takeover offer by private equity firms.  Zendesk reports Q1 results April 28 after the close. Adjusted profit is expected to fall 18% to 14 cents share. Look for revenue to be up 29% $384.27 million. Composite Rating: 90 Latest-quarter EPS % change: 45% Latest-quarter sales % change: +32% Five-year annualized EPS growth rate: 102% Annual return on equity: 17% Up/down volume ratio: 2.3 PAYX Stock  Paychex has a Composite Rating of 95 from IBD, helped by solid fundamentals and strong price performance in the stock market. The company operates a human capital management software as a service platform, providing payroll, human resource , retirement and insurance services for small- to medium-sized businesses A weekly chart for PAYX shows a couple of big accumulation weeks (heavy-volume weekly price gains) as the stock formed the right side of a cup base. That's a positive because it shows institutional investors were in there buying. PAYX stock reversed nicely off lows on March 30, ending with gain of 3.3% in higher volume after the company reported a 20% rise in quarterly profit. Revenue increased 15% to nearly $1.28 billion. Full-year guidance was also bullish. Paychex now sees annual earnings growth of 22.5% to 23%, up from prior guidance of 18% to 20%. It sees full-year revenue growth of 12% to 13%, up from prior guidance of 10% to 11%. ""We had a strong calendar year-end and selling season, delivering a record quarter for new sales revenue and maintaining high levels of client retention,"" said Paychex CEO Martin Mucci in the earnings release.  Paychex is taking a breather now, while holding above its 21-day exponential moving average, a key short-term support level to watch. It's been an orderly decline so far as a handle forms. The handle area is where the last remaining sellers get shaken out of a stock before a breakout. But breakouts need a healthy stock market as a tailwind, and the market remains in a distribution phase.

37,0,COUNTER INTELLIGENCE // Dinkytownâs Camdi is calling it quits,1073 words,Star-Tribune,"She started by offering American Chinese classics ï¿½?kung pao, sesame chicken, stir fry. As the area began to draw more foreigners, thanks to its proximity to the University of Minnesota, Phan added more traditional Vietnamese dishes, too. In recent years, Camdi Restaurant expanded its vegetarian and vegan menu. At first, Phan said her approach to running a restaurant, as a young, female, immigrant entrepreneur, was largely trial and error. âThat was tough. Up and down, up and down. We make mistakes and we learn,ï¿½?she said. Her restaurant-owning friends helped guide her, and about 10 years in, her husband, Kiet Phan, joined her in the business. So did the Phansï¿½?three children, who grew up pitching in at the restaurant. âI went to the U and worked there in between classes,ï¿½?said daughter Jenny Poon. âI remember paying my quarterly tuition with dollar bills from the tip money from the restaurant.ï¿½?The Phans had been mulling over selling the restaurant when the pandemic hit. They shrunk their hours and went to takeout-only. Now, with the pandemic beginning to abate, business hasnât recovered. âDinkytown is not that busy like before,ï¿½?Phan said, perhaps due to fewer foreign students returning. Itâs only the latest change to the neighborhood that Camdi Restaurant has witnessed. Seemingly every building around it has been knocked down and turned into a high-rise. The restaurant itself will become a real estate office for the apartments in the area, Phan said. Sheâs looking forward to retirement and spending time with her grandchildren. âIt will be fun to give life a little change,ï¿½?she said. Before the restaurant closes, Phan says, she hopes longtime customers will return to say goodbye. From professors who have since retired to kids who grew up coming to the restaurant and who now have families of their own, âI want to say thank you for their support,ï¿½?she said. Camdi Restaurant (1325 SE. 4th St., Mpls., eatatcamdi.com) will be open 4 to 8 p.m. through Saturday. In other closure news Fans of Lowertown St. Paulâs Tin Whiskers Brewing have until the end May to say cheers to the eight-year-old brewery (125 E. 9th St., St. Paul, twbrewing.com). âWe have fought hard to keep our brewery running and continue to make the beers you love to drink, but the brewery is no longer sustainable to keep going,ï¿½?said a statement on social media. And Zettaâs (2424 Nicollet Av. S., Mpls.), the minuscule Eat Street shop known for its ricotta sandwiches, closed March 18. Instead, the team will expand the menu of their ghost kitchen, Yeah Yeah Taco (yeahyeahtaco.com). âWith our 260-square-foot space, itâs too hard and cramped to run two restaurants out of it,ï¿½?they said in an Instagram announcement. âItâs been an amazing ride.ï¿½?Hereâs at least one bright spot. Emilyâs Lebanese Deli, which shuttered early in March due to a family health issue, reopened this week at 641 University Av. NE., Mpls., emilyslebanesedeli.com. Seasonâs greetings These reopenings are a sure sign of spring. Sea Salt Eatery, on Minnehaha Falls, announced it will open for the season on April 15 (4825 Minnehaha Av. S., Mpls., seasaltmpls.com). The St. Paul Farmers Market in Lowertown is returning Saturdays and Sundays beginning April 23, and will run through November (290 E. 5th St., St. Paul, stpaulfarmersmarket.com). And after a two-year hiatus, A to Z Produce and Bakeryâs Tuesday night pizza farm will be back May 3 on a reservation-only basis (N2956 Anker Lane, Stockholm, Wis., atozproduce andbakery.com). Coming soon The Minneapolis Club is betting on a bit of nostalgia when it opens its exclusive space to nonmembers for dining for the first time. On the ground floor, the historic bar from Charlieâs Exceptionale is being installed and chef Jamie Malone, formerly of Grand Cafe and currently of Petite Atelier, will write the menu. Sheâs been mulling over vintage menus from the restaurant for inspiration. Reservations will be open to the public for a limited time starting April 1, with nonmember dining beginning April 20. After 90 days of lunch and dinner service, the dining room will once again revert to being members-only. The Minneapolis Club (729 2nd Av. S., Mpls., mplsclub.org) was founded in 1883 to provide âa private city club for like-minded leaders of the community,ï¿½?according to its website. Hold the Wheat saw lines and a speedy sellout for its soft opening over the weekend. The new bakery (4050 Brookside Av. S., St. Louis Park, holdthewheat.com) is the work of baker Spencer Justiniano and his partner, Edwin Snyder. In 2016, Justiniano started following a gluten-free diet after years of suffering from stomach issues, but missed baked treats. After some time tinkering, he amassed a collection of recipes for baked goods and began selling them first to friends and then to an ever-widening community. The bakeryâs opening menu includes cookies, hand pies and mini cakes draped in vegan frosting and adorned with little curlicue designs. The menu eventually will expand beyond sweets into savory pies and more. The bakery is holding another soft opening March 24 from 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. or until they sell out; the grand opening is March 26. Hot dogs stuffed with cheese, dipped in a dairy-free batter and served on a stick sounds like a new State Fair entry. But itâs the specialty of the Korean hot dog chain CrunCheese, which will debut in Dinkytown (401 14th Av. SE., cruncheesehotdog.com) this spring. The restaurant (think adventurous corn dog) offers a variety of sausages, cheeses, toppings and the option of a squid-ink-laced batter. This is the chainâs first outlet in the state.
