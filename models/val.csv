65,0,P&O Ferries sackings put workersï¿½?rights in the spotlight,639 words,The Guardian,"These workers, mainly female and of south Asian origin, prepared food for British Airways flights. They were dismissed while attending a meeting called by their union to protest against the imposition of agency workers on their production line. A third of the workforce were subsequently rehired on contracts offering inferior pay and working conditions in a compromise agreement negotiated by their union, the TGWU. Among the remainder, many took voluntary redundancy, while others, including older women, were selected for compulsory redundancy. Some 60 women who refused to accept what they saw as unfair dismissal took their cases to an employment tribunal, and lost. The Gate Gourmet workersï¿½?struggle against hire-and-fire policies has been largely forgotten, but highlighted well-founded fears about cuts in workersï¿½?protection. We need safeguards against employersï¿½?strategies to downgrade workersï¿½?pay and conditions. We also need to resist pitting agency workers against those with secure contracts, British workers against migrant ones, and recognise this as an attack on all workersï¿½?rights. The governmentâs response to this unfair and potentially illegal flouting of accepted process for large-scale redundancies will be watched carefully, given the steep fall in real wages and living standards across the economy. Prof Sundari Anitha  University of Lincoln  Emeritus Professor Ruth PearsonUniversity of Leeds ï¿½?P&O Ferriesï¿½?action is not exceptional. This old maritime historian remembers similar cavalier disregard for workers 34 years ago. In May 1988, P&O European Ferries sacked 400 personnel[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1988/may/11/seamens-dispute] at Dover. Untrained crew and strike breakers were recruited in their place, which created a safety risk to passengers. Today P&O is wheeling in agency staff. Same risk. Today P&O says the 20% cut is part of necessary rationalisation. Same excuse. But last time, new Channel Tunnel competition was cited as justification. P&O was out to break union power. The outcome in 1988 was that the courts sequestered[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1990/may/22/union-assets-sequestration] the seafarersï¿½?union assets and funds. P&O finished off the National Union of Seamen, which had protected lives in this dangerous trade for over a century. P&Oâs past action left seafarers, already one of the most vulnerable occupational groups, even more vulnerable. Dr Jo Stanley Marsden, West Yorkshire ï¿½?Your explainer ( 18 March[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/18/po-ferries-sackings-brexit-uk-eu-employment-law] ) concludes that the P&O sackings arenât really due to Brexit. However, it could be argued that, had we not already been out of the EU, this is exactly the sort of thing that would have been blamed on our membership, instead of the normal operation of naked capitalism. Phil Coughlin Houghton-le-Spring, Tyne and Wear ï¿½?No doubt P&O Ferries factored the potential costs of unfair dismissal into its decision to fire staff without notice. Since the only thing it seems to understand is the profit motive, the best way to approach it is with a full-scale consumer boycott.

948,0,Hotel mania: $700m of Sydney pubs change hands,521 words,The Australian - Online,"While 17 Sydney pubs sold in 2020, 12 months later there were more than 32 deals. However, prices were not as strong with the average Sydney pub selling for $21.5m in 2021, down on the $23.5m fetched on average during 2020. HTL Property Managing Director Andrew Jolliffe said that when you consider the enormity of capital looking to be invested pubs are an asset class that provides safe harbour while the entire industry is highly regulated which serves as a barrier to entry. âBuyers are looking for a blended mix of revenues including food and beverage as well as pokies and accommodation,ï¿½?he said. Mr Jolliffe expects even more transactions this year. âItâs the second week of January and we have sold four hotels so far which is ahead of last year which was a record year,ï¿½?he said. The sale of the Hotel Brunswick, just north of Byron, which was owned by Mr Gyngell, a former CEO of the Nine Entertainment Group, and his business partner Delvene Delaney, was the biggest regional deal. The purchaser was associated with the Moelis Group which also owns the Beach Hotel in Byron Bay which it purchased for $104m. In Sydney, the sale of the Vineyard Hotel also by HTL Property, to publican Andrew Lazarus capped off a strong year of deals particularly in the cityâs north west growth corridor. Mr Jolliffe said the new year had started well with the $15m sale of the Budgewoi Coast Hotel on the NSW Central Coast as well as the sale of the Fitzroy Hotel in Sydneyâs outer Windsor which was bought by acquisitive hotelier Fraser Short in partnership with hotelier Todd Jacques for less than $10m. Mr Jolliffe said the Fitzroy Hotel, one of the oldest continuously licensed hotels in NSW, needed some renovation work. Meanwhile, Sydneyâs hotel industry yesterday reported its highest room occupancies for the pandemic era occurred in December, 2021 when average hotel occupancies hit 45 per cent. Data agency STR said the big increase in hotel occupancies was due to the beginning of summer and the impact of the holiday season with average daily rates climbing to $236.64 per night which is the highest achieved for any month in the past two years. December revenue per available room, the standard industry measure, rose to $106.38 per night the highest since mid 2021. On New Yearâs Eve Sydneyâs room rates rose to $533.81 per night which was the highest achieved since December 31, 2019 when rooms averaged $651.85 for the night."

The Global Engagement Center (GEC) was created in the Obama administration for more than $40 million and was tasked with countering foreign disinformation. A similar disinformation venture exists at USAGM. The GEC remains largely opaque. It is long past time to combine all of these programs in a new organization that can be far more efficient and less embarrassing than USAGM has been.

521,1,Coca-Cola shares set record highs: how to invest from Argentina and earn in dollars,450 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"There are several reasons for this, but its solid performance in times of uncertainty such as those currently being experienced and its high pricing power, which allows it to survive the growing inflation, which in March reached 8.5% year-on-year in the United States, stand out. In addition, at the end of February, the company announced a dividend increase to USD 0.44 per share. As a result, shareholders will receive almost 5% more on a quarterly basis. Through a press release, it was informed that the Board of Directors of The Coca-Cola Company approved the 60th consecutive dividend increase, so that the annual income will be USD 1.76 per share, when previously it was USD 1.68 per share. Based on the latest share price, the annual dividend yield would be around 2.5%. To take advantage of the growth and strength of The Coca-Cola Company from Argentina, all you need to do is purchase its Cedears. What are CedearsCedears (Argentine Certificates of Deposit) are financial instruments traded in the local market and are equivalent to ""portions"" of shares traded in foreign markets. The interesting thing about the Cedears is that they not only allow to avoid the Argentine stock risk, but also protect the investor from an eventual devaluation because they are ""tied"" to the evolution of the CCL dollar: if the foreign shares remain stable, but this exchange rate rises, then the Cedears will increase in price. How to buy Coca-Cola CedearsInvesting in Coca-Cola Cedears to collect their dividends in dollars and take advantage of their appreciation is very simple. First, you need to open a trading account (investment account) with a broker that is properly regulated by the National Securities Commission (CNV). Currently, there are many, so it is recommended to browse the BYMA ranking of brokers that month after month highlights the largest and most important ones. Subsequently, it only remains to deposit the desired funds from a bank account of the same holder and contact the designated financial advisor in order to build a portfolio that is properly diversified and provides a good return in dollars."

800,1,"White Horse Auto Wash Announces New Location Opening at 6215 Charles Arrington Drive, Franconia, VA 22310",567 words,PR Newswire,"Bob Rust and family are no strangers to the Northern Virginia community and culture. In fact, the company name, ""White Horse Auto Wash"" even has a local meaning behind it. The name originated from a fishing rock that bares the same name as the company and is located on the east side of the Shenandoah River. The story goes that when the water in the river rises and is rushing over the rock it looks like white horses in stride. The same goes for the company - when car counts rise at the washes and vehicles come rushing in, the teams handle the business and work together in stride. As for the Franconia location, the company is looking forward to the success that stems from the community support and guests who have visited other White Horse locations. What sets White Horse Auto Wash apart from the typical car washes is not only the broad range of services offered such as details, interior cleans, waxes, or the state-of-the-art equipment and chemicals that every vehicle receives each wash, but the main separation factor comes from the people that White Horse employs. For an interior and exterior cleaning, guests can expect a 20 minute or less wait time with a ""smile-guaranteed"" send off at the end of the service. White horse Franconia will offer a full-service unlimited plan for $49.99 and guests will be able to visit as many days in the month as they desire (between the hours of 8am and 7pm during the summer), to keep their car sparkling clean. For more information about services offered please visit www.whitehorseautowash.com [http://www.whitehorseautowash.com]. ""For me, the best part of a new site opening is getting to meet all the new guests that visit the site while getting to learn and become a part of the different communities. We are expecting big things from this location and have no doubt the team in Franconia will succeed those high expectations and compete to be the busiest site in the company,"" said District Manager, Garrett Giles. The General manger will be Mr. Tanner Ott who has been with White Horse for five years.

204,0,BREAKINGVIEWS-What a business sticking with Russia ought to mean,750 words,Reuters News,"NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Western companies active in Russia have been forced to move quickly. Some, like PayPal , Exxon Mobil , https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/News/Newsroom/News-releases/2022/0301_ExxonMobil-to-discontinue-operations-at-Sakhalin-1_make-no-new-investments-in-Russia [https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/News/Newsroom/News-releases/2022/0301_ExxonMobil-to-discontinue-operations-at-Sakhalin-1_make-no-new-investments-in-Russia] , and LVMH have decided to pull out in the wake of President Vladimir Putin 's invasion of Ukraine. Others, including Uniqlo, seem to be staying put, for now. There can be reasons to stay in Russia, but they need to be good. Companies that benefit Moscow's coffers or play to the elite class have the most explicit moral reasons to leave. Exxon and LVMH fall into that category, as does Shell , which issued an apology on Tuesday for buying Russian oil last week. Companies that facilitate transactions, like, Visa , Mastercard , American Express and PayPal had little choice but to suspend their businesses. For some, the latest financial incentives make that outcome easier to live with. A raft of sanctions imposed by Europe, the United States and others may mean directly affected activities grind to a near halt anyway. Longer term, the impact of excluding Russia from big parts of the global economy is surely a blow to the outlook for every Russian business. The trickier situations arise when ordinary Russians could suffer. Nissan Motor , which sold 53,000 cars in Russia last year, decided to stop exports to the country, per Reuters. So did General Motors , though it sells far fewer cars. The Big Four accounting firms ï¿½?Deloitte , EY , KPMG and PwC ï¿½?said they would leave too. All these companies employ thousands of Russian citizens ï¿½?KPMG âs decision, for example, will affect some 4,500 partners and staff in Russia and Belarus, Reuters says. Thereâs a case for businesses that provide essential mass-market goods to stick around, lest they punish citizens who have no influence over Putinâs actions. Clothing retailer Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing , for example, says it wants to continue to give Russian citizens access to cheap clothing. Yogurt maker Danone 's products will still be available, too, though the company will not make new investments. Japan Tobacco also plans to keep stocking the shelves in Russia. Its tax payments accounted for 1.4% of the Kremlin's budget in 2020, according to Reuters. JT also employs 4,500 people there. McDonaldâs , however, said on Tuesday that it will temporarily close restaurants https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/press-releases.Russia-update.html [https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/press-releases.Russia-update.html] and pause operations in Russia despite having 62,000 employees in the country. There are few black-and-white cases, and many foreign businesses choosing to remain can make a reasonable argument for their choice.

While commenting on Infosys, Motilal Oswal Financial Services said, ""We have lowered our FY23 and FY24 EPS estimate by 5 per cent on slower growth and margin pressure. However, we view Infosys as a key beneficiary of an acceleration in IT spending, given its capabilities around cloud and digital transformation. We value the stock at 28 times FY24E EPS and reiterate our Buy rating."" It has set a target price of Rs 2,000 for Infosys, indicating an upside of 14 per cent from the current market price.  ICICI Securities said, ""Infosys revenue and margin numbers were below our estimates for Q4."" Meanwhile, Infosys' operating profit increased 8 per cent YoY to Rs 6,956 crore in Q4FY22. However, the figure declined by 7 per cent on a QoQ basis. The operating margin fell to 21.50 per cent in the March quarter against 24.50 per cent in the corresponding quarter last year and 23.50 per cent in the sequential quarter ended December 31, 2021.  Infosys gave guidance for revenue growth of 13-15 per cent in constant currency and an operating margin of 21-23 per cent for FY23. The company ended FY22 within the guided range which means revenue of Infosys grew by 19.7 per cent in constant currency terms against the guided range of 19.5-20 per cent while the EBIT margin for FY22 was 23 per cent against the guided range of 22-24 per cent. Japanese brokerage firm Nomura also retained a 'Buy' call on Infosys with a target price of Rs 2,050. ""We lower FY22-24F EPS by around 5-7 per cent primarily on our lower margin expectations. We expect Infosys' revenue growth to continue to outpace that of TCS in FY23F,"" Nomura said. Mitul Shah, head of research, Reliance Securities said, ""Infosys reported a subdued Q4FY22 performance. Revenue and margins both were below our expectations. Considering the industry-leading double-digit revenue growth, the rising share of digital business (58.5 per cent of revenue), elevated EBIT margin levels against pre-Covid levels and a consistent capital allocation policy, we have a 'Buy' recommendation at present with a 1-year target price of Rs 2,250, valuing the stock at 30 times FY24E earnings.""

949,0,Chicken out of stock: meat in short supply on Australian supermarket shelves and at KFC,743 words,The Guardian,"The staff shortages have significantly cut sales at Inghamâs and made some products unavailable at one of its big customers, KFC. Australians eat almost 47kg of chicken each a year, making it the countryâs most popular meat, according to industry statistics[https://www-chicken-org-au.proxy.library.nyu.edu/facts-and-figures/]. It is also the cheapest meat on the market ï¿½?at an average of $5.43 a kilo it is less than half the price of pork, lamb and beef. âThe rapid spread of the Omicron variant across eastern Australian states from December 2021 and the resulting staff shortages, are now also having a significant impact on the Australian supply chain, operations, logistics and sales performance of Inghamâs, and some of its suppliers and customers,ï¿½?Inghamâs said in a statement to the ASX that sent its share price tumbling more than 6%. âThis has disrupted production and distribution capability, and impacted sales.ï¿½?Market sources said Inghamâs customers included KFC, which Guardian Australia has confirmed is suffering from a shortage of some products due to difficulty in obtaining fresh chicken pieces on the east coast. Staff shortages are worst in processing plants, where chickens are cut into pieces such as thigh and breast fillets. This has resulted in Inghamâs shipping more whole chickens to supermarkets and other retailers. Consumers have reported empty shelves in the chicken sections of supermarkets as shoppers clear out available stock.

Its managing director, Andrew Reeves, said many employees were âforced to isolate at home due to contracting Covid in the community or as a result of being close contactsï¿½? He said a decision by state and federal governments which removed a requirement for asymptomatic close contacts who work in the meat industry to isolate for seven days âshould assist to alleviate some of the current staff shortagesï¿½? âAs operating conditions begin to stabilise, we expect our production capacity to recover relatively quickly to meet customer and consumer demand.ï¿½?The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, said workers in meatworks were particularly vulnerable to catching Covid-19. âThereâs social distancing thatâs been put in place but that is not enough with Omicron and inevitably if one person on that line gets sick and is infectious thereâs a high chance, especially as we know because of that type of wet, cold environment, for it to spread as well,ï¿½?she said. Eggs, however, are not yet in short supply, with the industry confident that it can handle the disruptions. âAny absence of eggs in stores is a result of disruptions to supermarket staffing and logistics, and not a reflection of continuity of supply,ï¿½?said Rowan McMonnies, managing director of Australian Eggs. âAustraliaâs 21 million hens are still laying eggs, and farmers are working around the clock to get those eggs to their customers,ï¿½?he said."
523,0,Travel to Ireland: latest holiday advice as Covid rules in pubs and restaurants are scrapped,446 words,The Telegraph Online,"In addition, social distancing rules, including spectator limits at sporting events, have been scrapped. However, some rules will continue. Face masks are being retained until at least the end of February, while a Covid pass will still be required for international travel. Here we answer all the key questions about trips to Ireland. Do I need to take a test before I travel to Ireland? Travellers who are not fully vaccinated or in possession of a proof of recovery certificate have to show a negative PCR test (taken no more than 72 hours before entry). This includes travellers from Great Britain, but not those whose journey originates in Northern Ireland. Fully vaccinated or recovered passengers travelling from Great Britain to Ireland will need to have proof of their full vaccination or recovery record to avoid the testing requirement. The Irish Government advises all travellers to undertake daily antigen tests for five consecutive days, beginning with the day of arrival, but this is not mandatory. What about children? Children aged 11 and under do not need to take a test prior to travelling to Ireland. Do I need to complete a Passenger Locator Form? Yes. All arrivals must complete a Passenger Locator Form in advance of arriving in Ireland. You can find the form here.[https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ab900-covid-19-passenger-locator-form/] The Passenger Locator Form will be checked by air or sea carriers before departure. Individuals travelling from Great Britain to Ireland via Northern Ireland should also complete the form. Do I need to take a test before returning from Ireland to the UK? No. If youâre travelling to England from within the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, you do not need to complete a passenger locator form, take any Covid tests, or quarantine on arrival in England, regardless of your vaccination status. Are there any Covid restrictions in Ireland? Under new guidelines, announced on January 21, hospitality venues can return to normal operations (currently, pubs and restaurants must close at 8pm), and customers will not be asked for a Covid pass. In addition, social distancing rules, including spectator limits at sporting events, have been scrapped. However, face masks are being retained until at least the end of February."

Investors with Losses Over $100K to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - CABA",761 words,Newsfile,"WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Cabaletta class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=3749[https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/RVJzqhD1nW] or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com[mailto:pkim@rosenlegal.com] or cases@rosenlegal.com[mailto:cases@rosenlegal.com] for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 29, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, the IPO offering documents and defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) top-line data of the Phase 1 Clinical Trial indicated that DSG3-CAART had, among other things, worsened certain participants' disease activity scores and necessitated additional systemic medication to improve disease activity after DSG3-CAART infusion; (2) accordingly, DSG3-CAART was not as effective as the Company had represented to investors; (3) therefore, the Company had overstated DSG3-CAART's clinical and/or commercial prospects; and (4) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

703,1,Global Medical Devices Market Outlook Report 2022: Digital Efficiency Solutions for Operating Rooms and Competitive Intensity are Opening up New Growth Opportunities - ResearchAndMarkets.com,929 words,Business Wire,"As the healthcare sector adapts to the changes induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, the global medical devices industry is undergoing a major transformation in terms of business models, technology adoption, and care delivery approaches, among other areas. 2022 will prove to be another challenging year for medtech as uncertainties pertaining to COVID-19 variants and the resultant pauses in elective surgeries continue to plague the provider space. Supply chain challenges are likely to continue throughout the year, which will impact the availability of raw materials and finished devices and raise inflation. All the major medtech manufacturers have predicted headwinds due to the healthcare workforce shortage (compounding the issue of medical device uptake), and this will be exacerbated by employee burnout, new waves and variants of the virus, rising case numbers, vaccine mandates, the Great Resignation, skyrocketing salaries for nurses, and the Great Retirement. The digitalization of medical devices will continue, and OEMs are digitalizing their devices and operations (sales, marketing). This trend is also making a mark by pushing medtech to deliver value for providers and patients with devices and digital data. This is leading to the development of new business models such as platform approaches; however, it is also exposing medtech companies to more potential scrutiny in terms of cybersecurity risks. On the contrary, the adoption of minimally invasive surgery techniques, the rising adoption of surgical robots, and the gradual shift of some procedures to outpatient settings will continue to drive the uptake of some medical device categories, including consumables. Advancements in configuration and connectivity have spurred new types of robotic surgeries, wherein surgeons use remote surgery tools to implant a stimulation device into a Parkinson's patient's brain despite the patient being 1,000+ miles away. Cardiology care is moving to a care continuum approach, which drove the acquisitions of solution providers by large OEMs in 2021. This will push the cardiac devices space to focus on pre- and post-therapy patient monitoring to ensure improved long-term outcomes. From a broader industry dynamics perspective, every stakeholder in the medtech space (including other healthcare sectors) predicts increased mergers and acquisitions within the industry. Moreover, a consolidation of healthcare providers is observed in some regions. Provider sector experts predict a few megamergers of health systems in the United States, including physician practice acquisitions; however (and more importantly) a drive to acquire assets and build a continuity of care model is being noticed, and this approach will be able to support all types of care delivery needs - from primary care to surgical care, delivered virtually, in retail settings, homes, urgent care centers, and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs).  Bio-surveillance devices for infection prevention in hospitals and other healthcare facilities will see rising demand. Similar trends are likely to be observed for patient monitoring devices and remote patient monitoring equipment to deal with subsequent waves of COVID-19 (although the patient monitoring equipment is saturated, replacements might continue). Moreover, demand for innovative solutions for digital operating room management and efficiency will increase to meet surgical workflow needs and enable real-time communication and data sharing during surgery. As higher acuity cases gradually shift to ASCs, medtech OEMs will redesign their device portfolios to meet the specific needs of this care provider type. Women's health is another high-growth segment due to the surge in women entrepreneurs, the emergence of women-led start-ups, and the growing number of women's health initiatives, which will push the femtech industry to launch innovative solutions to address long-standing women's health and hygiene issues.

624,1,Big banks flex strength in commercial lending,791 words,American Banker Online,"âWe are seeing a pronounced pick-up,ï¿½?said Cheryl Pate, a portfolio manager at Angel Oak Capital Advisors, comparing the recent increase in commercial lending to past periods of rapid growth after a recession. At Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, executives said the commercial loan growth reflects strength across many subcategories. They also said they expect further momentum as businesses invest in growth to meet pent-up demand from the pandemic. The commercial loan growth during the first quarter reflected slowing paydowns, increased business activity and higher utilization rates across most sectors and geographies, Chief Financial Officer Terry Dolan said Thursday during a call with analysts. Dolan noted that sentiment among business clients is positive and stable, and he said that borrowers are using loan proceeds to build inventory, make capital expenditures, and enter into mergers and acquisitions. Asked about the impact of inflation on business investment[https://www-americanbanker-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/news/bok-financial-warns-of-50-million-securities-loss-tied-to-inflation-war] ï¿½?following news this week that inflation reached a four-decade high in March ï¿½?Dolan said that higher costs are fueling near-term investments in technology. Businesses that are grappling with labor shortages and higher salary costs are investing in tech to create efficiencies and offset wage inflation, he said. âItâs going to be important to automate as much as we possibly can,ï¿½?Dolan said in an interview, referring to businesses across industries. âAt least in the near term, capital expenditure will continue to be reasonably strong.ï¿½?At the $587 billion-asset parent company of U.S. Bank, commercial loans fueled an advance in total loans of more than 3%. âThis might wind up being some of the best commercial loan growth that we see on a linked-quarter basis,ï¿½?said Mike Mayo, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities.  U.S. Bancorpâs net interest income rose nearly 2% from the previous quarter to $3.2 billion. For the full year, the company projected 8% to 11% growth in interest income, reflecting both loan growth and rising interest rates[https://www-americanbanker-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/news/bank-earnings-to-spotlight-rising-interest-rates-and-costs]. Federal Reserve policymakers raised their benchmark rate in March and forecasted several more hikes this year. At least some bank clients will likely look to borrow in the near term to avoid paying higher rates down the road, potentially providing another boost to loan demand this year, Dolan said. âI expect people will be trying to get ahead of it,ï¿½?he said in the interview. At Wells Fargo, executives said that demand for commercial loans continues to rise more than two years into the pandemic. Quarterly commercial loan volumes were flat or slightly down earlier in 2021, but they started to rebound in the fourth quarter of last year, and that trend accelerated during the first quarter of 2022. Between January and March, average loans in Wells Fargoâs commercial bank grew to $194.4 billion, up from $184.6 billion three months earlier. Larger clients drove a sizable chunk of the increase, as companies built back their inventories, and inflation led to higher costs for transportation and materials, Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo said during a call with analysts. The $1.9 trillion-asset bank is also seeing commercial customers use credit to fund longer-term expansion plans, including some businesses that are âcatching upï¿½?on capital expenditures after keeping them low during the earlier stages of the pandemic, Santomassimo said. In addition, companies are tapping their revolving lines of credit more, though utilization rates remain below prepandemic levels, he said. At JPMorgan, average total commercial loans rose to $210.7 billion in the quarter, up by about 2% compared with both the fourth quarter of 2021 and the year-ago quarter. Citigroup, whose corporate loans in North America rose to $129.2 billion, reported similar percentage increases. PNC's commercial loans rose to $195.6 billion on average last quarter, up 1% from the prior quarter and 19% from a year earlier. The jump was partly due to companies' higher capital expenditures, inventory buildups and usage of revolving credit lines, PNC Chief Executive Bill Demchak said Thursday during a call with analysts. The industrywide uptick in commercial lending is an indication that âdespite increasing uncertainty, the economy is still fairly strong,ï¿½?said John Mackerey, an analyst at the credit ratings agency DBRS Morningstar."
329,0,Popular 'pay as you feel' restaurant chain goes out of business after running out of cash - with its last three branches set to shut within days,470 words,Mail Online,"* Customers can pay for what they think a meal is worth or volunteer to help out A popular 'pay what you like' vegan restaurant chain will shut its doors for good after running out of cash. The last three remaining Lentil As Anything stores in Melbourne will close on February 27, founder Shanaka Fernando announced. His Sydney restaurant in Newtown was shut up shop at the end of January, after landlords changed the locks over a row about rent payments during the pandemic. Mr Fernando's restaurant chain asked customers to pay only what they thought a meal was worth or else they could pay it back through volunteering. 'We have tried to hang on as long as we could, but it is now untenable,' Mr Fernando said in a statement. 'It breaks my heart'. Mr Fernando said that Lentil As Anything provided one million meals a year - but just 30 per cent were paid for. Backpackers and university students made up a chunk of customers and volunteers, causing havoc with the business model when Covid forced border closures. 'We still provided about 100,000 free meals during the lockdowns, but we are now in a position where our income is not meeting the cost of our outgoings,' the founder added. Several GoFundMe fundraising campaigns had been launched by community members determined not to let the beloved business collapse. One aimed at raising $400,000 made just $3435, but another created in December made more than $15,000. A campaign in 2020 raised $373,000 - but the business was unable to stay afloat while the Covid pandemic continued to drastically impact income. The Sri Lankan born founder started Lentil As Anything in 2000, having spoken to a former Vietnam War correspondent who was since living rough on the streets of St Kilda. 'I had a dream to provide food to people without them having to worry about money,' he said. 'It breaks my heart because I know that so many of you rely on us as a resource, not just for a meal but for social connection 'I dearly hope in some way our values and practices will remain and spread in our society.' Lentil as Anything was subject to a FairWork investigation in 2020 for wage underpayment. The business had stores in Newtown in Sydney and Thornbury, St Kilda and Abbotsford in Melbourne. Mr Fernando was awarded Australia's Local Hero at the 2007 Australian of the Year Awards."
641,0,"Trudeau to ask Canadaâs broadcast regulator to review RTâs âpresence on Canadian airwavesï¿½? Russia Today was referred to as a âcriticalï¿½?part of âRussiaâs disinformation and propaganda ecosystem,ï¿½?in a recent U.S. State Department report",907 words,The Globe and Mail (Breaking News),"âThe CRTC is an independent body and we will be asking them to begin the process to review Russia Todayâs presence on Canadian airwaves,ï¿½?Mr. Trudeau said on Monday, referring to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. He added that âthe rigorous process is important when it comes to the independence of media in our country.ï¿½?RT is included in a list non-Canadian channels authorized for distribution. If it were to be removed from that list, TV providers would not be permitted to carry it in the future. âThe CRTC has received complaints about RT from citizens and is analyzing the situation,ï¿½?spokesperson Eric Rancourt wrote in an e-mail. âWe are also aware of the Prime Ministerâs comments and are awaiting further information.ï¿½?For years, RTâs priority has been to secure the widest distribution possible, including in Canada. While many cable channels make money by earning a per-subscriber fee from distributors, RT did not charge one. In 2017, The Globe and Mail reported [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/canadian-tv-providers-receive-payments-to-carry-russian-propaganda-machine/article37400743/] RT paid some major Canadian TV providers to carry the channel. In other cases, RT provided the signal for free. This meant many Canadians received the channel automatically in their TV packages, until the decisions this weekend to pull it off the air. Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong said on Monday that he believes there should be more transparency around such deals. âI think the cabinet should issue an order to the CRTC requiring Canadian TV providers to disclose payments they receive from foreign state-controlled broadcasters,ï¿½?Mr. Chong said. âIn an age of disinformation, transparency and information are effective ways counter propaganda from authoritarian states.ï¿½?Rogers, Shaw and Telus did not respond to questions on Monday about whether they received payments from RT for carriage, and how many households received the channel before it was pulled. Bell declined to provide that information. Independent Toronto-based telecom VMedia, which announced it was also pulling the channel on Monday, said it received RT for free. The CRTCâs Mr. Rancourt wrote in his e-mail that the regulator does not disclose information such as rates paid for carriage and other âcommercially sensitive informationï¿½?that is filed confidentially. Despite the changes to its TV distribution, RTâs content is still available for free online to Canadians who seek it out, including on RTâs own website and on YouTube, where some videos display the label, âRT is funded in whole or in part by the Russian government.ï¿½? YouTube, which is owned by Google parent company Alphabet Inc., has indefinitely suspended the ability for channels affiliated with Russian state-funded media, including RT, to make money from ads. âWe also significantly limited recommendations to several channels, including Russian channels affiliated with recent sanctions,ï¿½?YouTube spokesperson Lauren Skelly wrote in an e-mailed statement. âAnd in response to a government request, weâve restricted access to RT and a number of other channels in Ukraine. We will continue to monitor new developments and may take further actions.ï¿½?In his remarks, Mr. Trudeau highlighted âa significant amount of disinformation circulating from Russia, including on social media,ï¿½?during the crisis. The Russian embassy in Canada warned on Monday that Russia could retaliate with reciprocal countermeasures, but it did not specify what those would be. âItâs obvious discrimination against Russian media and also is a violation of the principle of the freedom of press and right of people to have access to the various sources of information in a pluralistic manner,ï¿½?the embassy said in a statement to The Globe. âIt shows that in Canada a right to different opinion can be undemocratically suppressed.ï¿½?VMedia co-founder George Burger said in an interview Monday that the decision to pull the channel was difficult because the company supports free expression and non-interference in content. But he drew the line at a state-owned âpropaganda outletï¿½?broadcasting during an armed conflict. âItâs very hard to watch whatâs going on and not have the feeling that by carrying it, weâre in a very indirect way, aiding and abetting. Thatâs just intolerable to us,ï¿½?Mr. Burger said. With a report from Alexandra Posadzki Your time is valuable.

226,1,Harrogate cafe Baltzersen's expands bakery and promises new jobs,393 words,Yorkshire Post,"Paul Rawlinson, co-director of Baltzersenâs and Bakeri Baltzersen, said: âWe are proud to be a part of the Harrogate community and weâre excited to be expanding in terms of both production and delivery. âWe want to grow our range of products to offer a wider selection, work with more wholesale partners across Yorkshire as we fly the flag for our town, and create new jobs, training and career opportunities for local people.ï¿½?Bakeri Baltzersen was set up in March of 2019 as a sister brand to Baltzersenâs Scandi-cafe, which launched in 2012 on Oxford Street in Harrogate town centre. Mr Rawlinson then took the decision in 2020 during the pandemic to open a purpose-built bakery at Kettlesing just outside Harrogate. Since then, Bakeri Baltzersen has been successfully supplying Baltzersenâs cafe and bakery shops, which also includes a retail outlet in Wetherby, alongside a growing number of wholesale partners across Yorkshire. The expansion will be part financed by a Â£27,390 grant provided by Harrogate Borough Council and a Â£20,000 grant from the Product and Process Innovation (PAPI) Fund - a legacy European funding programme.

463,1,How to make the most of employee share plans,1584 words,The Australian Financial Review,"For his boss and company founder, Magnus Hsu, the scheme giving employees a stake in his payment-platform company has helped attract and retain skilled staff in a cut-throat job market. ""I'm buying into the success of the company,"" says Barrett, who started with mx51 two years ago. ""I'm hoping the company can get all the way to a public share offering but am confident there will also be big benefits for me from a merger, acquisition or management buy-out,"" he says. COVID-19, caps on immigration and education shortfalls have resulted in skill shortages across the economy, which means big demand for qualified and experienced employees in health, engineering, trades and digital. The recent federal budget acknowledged problems facing employers in a tight labour market by boosting employee share scheme benefits in unlisted companies, and cutting red tape. A key benefit not available to listed companies is that eligible start-up employees will not be taxed on the granting or vesting of the options, says Shaun Cartoon, a tax partner at Arnold Bloch Leibler. Vesting means the employee can sell the shares. Instead, participants are taxed when they sell their shares, and the gain generally qualifies for the capital gains tax 50 per cent discount. ""In Australia, this is as close as it gets to share scheme nirvana,"" says Cartoon. Nigel Fellowes-Freeman, chief executive of Kanopi, an online insurance platform, says everyone in his company, from novices to veterans, is eligible for a share in the employee share scheme. ""It is a core part of our remuneration and has really helped us keep key staff,"" says Fellowes-Freeman, who started the company four years ago. Nick Deligiannis, managing director of Hays, an employment agency, says: ""We're seeing record levels of job vacancies across many industries, and staff shortages are exacerbating the war for talent. Businesses are incredibly concerned about how rising skills shortages will affect the effective operation of their organisation but also their ability to achieve growth ambitions for the year ahead."" But employee share schemes - for private and unlisted companies - hold potential legal and tax traps for management and employees if they lack clear guidelines on eligibility, measuring performance, vesting or keeping comprehensive records. Phillip London, senior tax counsel for Tax and Super Australia, an organisation that represents tax and superannuation professionals, says companies ranging from start-ups to blue chips are increasingly turning to the schemes to attract employees and help fill skill gaps. They are also effective for retaining high performers who often receive shares as a performance bonus, or as a form of remuneration, instead of getting a higher salary, analysis by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment shows. The number of schemes doubled in the seven years to 2015, with annual payments to employees totalling about $2 billion, or less than 1 per cent of the nation's total annual wages and sales, the department's latest available figures show. There was a big drop-off in popularity after the global financial crisis but a recent resurgence as the economy improved, unemployment fell and competition for skilled staff increased. While there are two main types of schemes, the flexible rules allow them to be tailored to align with the company's growth strategy and employee's requirements, London says. The upfront scheme, popular with listed companies, allows a discount of as much as $1000 tax-free. In other words, the first $1000 of ""free"" shares is tax-free. A tax-deferred scheme allows putting off paying tax until the income year in which the shares, or options, are vested. Other schemes - described as ""phantom"" - pay an equity increase as a bonus, or provide employees with non-recourse loans for buying shares. ""Phantom and loan schemes are often favoured by unlisted companies because there is not a readily available market for sale,"" says London. Employee share schemes are mostly used by mature, professional, technical and financial services companies but are increasingly popular with start-ups that cannot match salaries offered by established competitors. For mx51's Hsu, a share employee scheme is an essential part of his strategy to boost staff by about one-third to 120 employees over the next 12 months. ""It is very competitive recruiting and retaining engineers,"" says Hsu. ""They know our competitors pay well and also have share schemes."" The federal budget included plans to introduce higher investment thresholds for employee participants from October 1. Currently, employees of unlisted companies who don't fall into a few defined categories, such as senior managers and sophisticated investors, are restricted to offers of $5000 each year. That is being replaced with a cap of $30,000 a year, or $150,000 over five years. ""Employees at all levels of unlisted companies will be able to obtain an unlimited number of shares with unlimited underlying value, as long as safeguards are met,"" says Cartoon of Arnold Bloch Leibler. Those protections include employees not paying more than the monetary cap in a given year and the employer making simplified disclosure. ""The new laws apply to both listed and unlisted companies,"" says Cartoon. 'Listed companies have been largely content with the existing framework,"" he says. ""The sweet spot for the new rules will be high-growth tech start-ups and scale-ups that want to attract and retain the best talent, but have limited cash. That said, founders of new businesses generally guard their equity tightly and are reluctant to give it away unless it makes business sense."" Employees are generally taxed on the ""discount"" they receive on any shares or options granted by their employer. For example, if an employee is unconditionally issued $10,000 worth of free shares by their employer, the ""discount"" would be $10,000 and the employee would be assessed on that amount in the income year in which the shares are issued and taxed at the marginal rate. ""Managing the timing of the taxing point is absolutely critical for unlisted companies because there is often no ability to sell any shares to fund an inconvenient tax liability,"" says Cartoon. ""For this reason, many employee share plans are structured as rights or options plans, where the taxing point can generally be deferred to the date of exercise of the rights or options,"" he says. ""The removal of cessation of employment as a deferred taxing point from July 1 further increases the attractiveness of rights and options plans with long-dated exercise periods, which can ensure that participants (including so-called good leavers who leave the company and are allowed to keep their options) can align their taxing point with a liquidity event such as an initial public offering or share sale."" According to Jack Qi, a director of tax services at advisory firm William Buck, many companies fail to teach their employees about their scheme's advantages, or encourage them to obtain legal and tax advice. ""An employee will only be ... motivated if they feel they have something of value and a degree of control over that value,"" Qi says. ""Also, a scheme's fundamental purpose can be undermined by giving a company board powerful discretion on key terms."" Tomoyuki Hachigo, co-founder of Sprintlaw, an online law firm, says companies wanting a scheme need to agree on its purpose, employee eligibility, performance measurements and vesting conditions, which are the rights to realise the benefits. Kanopi's Fellowes-Freeman says: ""The important thing is to understand what you want to achieve with the scheme, such as to whom you want to distribute shares, how to make it fair, how to scale the scheme as employee numbers grow. The structure is very simple to work out from there."" A threshold issue for most companies is how to value distributions. London adds: ""Where a company is not listed, an employee might have problems in realising the share value of the investment. What are the exit options, or what are the strategies to be imposed by the employer for the employee to realise the value?"" Unlisted mx51 uses the value of the company estimated by third-party investors during capital raisings, says Hu. Independent valuers are used if staff or management believe the company should contest the price. William Buck's Qi warns some companies give verbal commitments to an employee before setting up a scheme. ""The problem is that in the intervening months or years, the value of the start-up has grown exponentially, which can result in a significant tax problem for the staff,"" he says. ""In addition, new investors would have come onboard and may not be aware of these commitments, which may not be in line with commercial expectations."" London says some employers might be better off considering alternatives, such as ""phantom schemes"" that link the bonus to the company's share price. ""That way there is no requirement to issue shares or options, simplifying accounting and tax treatment."" Employers offering the schemes recommend seeking legal and financial assistance about their structure and administration, says Mark Chapman, a director of tax specialist H&R Block.SI"

945,1,FanDuel and Blue Apron Alum Lainie Cooney Joins Bambee as Chief People Officer,908 words,Business Wire,"Bambee, the company that makes Human Resources affordable for every small to medium-sized business, is announcing today that HR veteran Lainie Cooney has joined Bambee as the company's Chief People Officer. ""Part of my affection for building companies is driven by a genuine motivation to identify the often-overlooked gifts in people,"" said Allan Jones, founder and CEO of Bambee. ""My belief is that seemingly ordinary people are actually innately extraordinary. Lainie shares this inherent belief in people and for that and many other reasons, I'm thrilled she has come on board. As a founder, my job is to build a culture that isn't just lip service, but one that has texture and is unique in its ability to activate each person's potential. To date, we've done this by hiring the best people possible across as many diverse backgrounds as we can reach. I am confident Lainie will carry the torch here."" Bambee is a first-of-its kind HR technology company that helps nearly 10,000 of America's small businesses put their HR on autopilot while also pairing each company with a dedicated HR Manager. Bambee's mission and its unique place in the market helped lure Cooney away from the top people role at FanDuel, an American gambling company that offers sportsbook, daily fantasy sports, online casino, poker, and horse race betting products that has recently been valued at $30B+. Cooney now joins Bambee's stellar executive team, comprised of former Headspace alum, Steven Gross, chief financial officer, former Bird Head of Government, Tommy Tate, chief product officer, and former ADP VP of Product Development, Mike Ruangutai, chief technology officer. Beyond her last role at FanDuel, Cooney joins Bambee with a wealth of people leadership experience she's built over the last 25 years at brands such as Home Depot, State Street, DPI Foods, and Blue Apron. ""I am both honored and incredibly excited to join Bambee. Bambee is an amazing company with great people and visionary leaders. I am looking forward to helping us realize our vision for our employees, and for the workers of small businesses across this country,"" said Cooney. ""I had the honor of leading Blue Apron's people strategy as their workforce grew by almost 3x in my tenure. I had a similar honor at FanDuel as their workforce grew by 5x. So I'll be well suited at Bambee as we expect to grow from a diverse group of 120 employees, to 300 within 2022 alone."" As a leading HR company for America's small businesses, Bambee puts extra emphasis on its people strategy. One of its three core objectives in 2022 is to create the space for Bambee employees to do the most fulfilling work of their careers. ""Bambee views its internal people strategy as key to our external customers trusting us with their HR,"" Jones said. ""We hire for traits like high aptitude, kindness, introspection, self-accountability, broad levels of creativity, and thoughtful optimism. These traits are rarely present on a resume. We don't care if you have a technology background or a Harvard MBA. This philosophy has helped us create a workforce as deeply diverse as the nation. We are well above average in representation of women, Asian Americans, African Americans, and members of the Latinx and LGBTQ communities. We lead this way not to hit a diversity quota, but because we know that the best talent comes packaged in a variety of personas. Now we need the people infrastructure and people leadership to continue building our intellectually unique team at scale. Lainie Cooney is undeniably the leader to help us do this."" The company also recently announced its $30M Series C investment. In this latest round, SoftBank joined QED, leader of both Series B and C rounds, and AlphaEdison, who led the Series A round. Key investments were also made by Mucker Capital, Ken Chenault (chairman and managing director, General Catalyst; and former CEO and chairman of American Express), Damian Maldonado (CEO and founder at American Financing and American Home Agent), and Gaingels (the LGBTQIA+/Allies investment syndicate). About Bambee Allan Jones founded Bambee in 2016. Bambee has been at the forefront of solving HR problems for small businesses since its inception. Bambee puts their customers' HR on autopilot, starting with a dedicated HR Manager and smart automation. Bambee helps each company navigate the complex regulatory world of compliance, HR policy, employee relations, and HR strategy -- including internal investigations, hires, furloughs, and return to work procedures. The combination of a real HR Manager coupled with an intelligent software platform gets Bambee customers to HR compliance, and helps keep them HR compliant year-round. In October 2021, Goldman Sachs celebrated Jones as one of the 100 most intriguing entrepreneurs, at their Builders + Innovators Summit. For three years running, Forbes has named Bambee a top startup employer in the U.S., and in 2022 listed Bambee as top 5 in Los Angeles. Learn more at www.bambee.com[http://www.bambee.com].

805,0,"Cyberattack on News Corp, Believed Linked to China, Targeted Emails of Journalists, Others -- Barrons.com",330 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"The attack, discovered on Jan. 20, affected a number of publications and business units including The Wall Street Journal and its parent Dow Jones; the New York Post; the company's U.K. news operation; and News Corp headquarters, according to a person familiar with the matter. After discovering the attack, the company notified law enforcement and hired cybersecurity firm Mandiant Inc. to support an investigation, the person said. ""Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests,"" said David Wong, vice president of incident response at Mandiant.  News Corp disclosed the hack in a securities filing Friday. Representatives for the Chinese Embassy in Washington didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.  News Corp believes the threat activity is contained and has been offering guidance to affected employees, the person said. The method of the hack and the number of staffers whose email accounts and documents were accessed couldn't be learned. Systems housing financial and customer data, including subscriber information, weren't affected, according to the person familiar with the matter. Law-enforcement officials and cybersecurity experts say that journalists are often high-priority targets for hackers seeking to gain intelligence on behalf of foreign governments because they speak to sources who might have valuable or sensitive information.

Dikshant's parents Ramesh Chandra Srivastava and Rashmi Srivastava say their son during brief calls that he could manage told them that there were sounds of explosions in the surrounding areas there. The duo, eagerly waiting for the arrival of their beloved son on Saturday, were disappointed with the last-minute cancellation of the flight.

116,0,Surge of Omicron Infections Prompts Lockdowns in China,1423 words,International New York Times,"China is grappling with its largest surge of Covid-19 infections since the coronavirus first emerged more than two years ago in central China. Sustained outbreaks in two-thirds of the countryâs provinces are proving the toughest test yet of Chinaâs zero-tolerance coronavirus policy. Even as countries in the West are now loosening or abandoning mask mandates and other measures, Chinese officials are implementing some of their most stringent methods. That is in large part because China canât afford to lift restrictions. The government has been concerned about comparatively lower rates of vaccination among Chinaâs older adults. The country also has far fewer intensive care hospital beds compared to its population than most industrialized countries. In Chinaâs vast rural areas, hospitals and medical facilities are often basic, and a major outbreak could quickly overwhelm hospitals. The United States and other Western countries have suffered far higher rates of infection and deaths over the past two years than China, and still have higher rates now. But the seven-day average rate of new cases in mainland China, now at 1,584, has more than quintupled in recent days. For many residents in China, the rapid spread of the virus has been unsettling. âBecause of the large number of cases in a short period of time, it is inevitable that there will be some panic all over the country, and Shanghai is no exception,ï¿½?said Dr. Zhang Wenhong, a prominent infectious disease expert in Shanghai, in a post on his social media account on Monday. China has responded to the current surge in cases by mobilizing its vast Communist Party apparatus to deploy workers and resources. In Jilin Province, where many cases have been recorded, workers are building temporary facilities [https://weibo.com/2656274875/LjE4zni24?refer_flag=1001030103_] to house thousands of people who test positive. Across the country, workers are corralling and testing millions of citizens every day. But that testing program is starting to be overwhelmed. âWe have noticed that there have been problems such as long lines and slow test results at many testing sites in the past two days,ï¿½?said Lu Taohong, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, at a news conference on Sunday night. Chinaâs virus containment strategy is focused on moving quickly to lock down buildings or neighborhoods. In response to even a single case, officials may seal all the entrances to a store, office building or even convention center. Everyone inside must then stay there for up to several days as they are tested for the coronavirus and sent into isolation if their results are positive. In Shanghai, many foreign-owned businesses stockpiled mattresses last week in case their employees were trapped in their factories or their offices this week. Multinationals there then told their employees to work from home this week. In Guangzhou, the municipal government on Friday sealed off the worldâs largest convention center, which was holding a beauty products exhibition. Videos circulating on Chinese social media platforms showed crowds of stranded convention goers milling around and looking for exits in attempts to evade the lockdown. The outbreakâs rapid spread and the governmentâs tough response have left some residents worried about the effect of lockdowns on their livelihoods. Li Yanhua, a grocery store manager in Shanghai, was notified on Saturday night that his neighborhood was locked down and residents would have to be tested for Covid. âIt was all of a sudden, we are not even prepared ï¿½?my family has not enough vegetables and daily necessities,ï¿½?Mr. Li said. âMy store is closed, but we still need to pay rent.ï¿½?Still, such measures have also been widely accepted as necessary for the good of public health. Li Junyan, a 33-year-old businessman in the locked down city of Changchun in northeastern China, has had to stop shipping fruit and health products to online customers because of travel restrictions but he is philosophical about it. âThere must be losses to my business, but there is nothing much I can do,ï¿½?he said. He and the other three other members of his family have been confined at their apartment since Saturday. âIn order not to cause chaos to the society, Iâll stay at home for the publicâs sake.ï¿½?Faye Li, 27, a brand management specialist at a food company in Shenzhen, said she wanted to spend time downtown over the weekend with two friends but canceled the plan because the government banned indoor dining. But she accepted this. âThe effect of the outbreak is small, and Iâm actually not very worried, ï¿½?Ms. Li said. âIâve been used to this.ï¿½?Chinese doctors and health officials insist that continued mass testing, quarantines and lockdowns are necessary. Opening up too soon could be disastrous, they warn. Many of the cases in recent days have been the Omicron variant, which while highly transmissible, has also tended to make people less sick than earlier variants of the coronavirus. A little more than half of those infected with the coronavirus in recent days in China do not show symptoms, according to data released by the government. But they are still infectious. âThe proportion of asymptomatic infections is high, the spread is hidden, and early detection is difficult,ï¿½?said Wu Fan, vice dean of Shanghai Medical College at Fudan University, at a government news conference on Sunday. âIt is not enough to simply screen in key areas or populations ï¿½?it is necessary to reduce or slow down the mobility of people.ï¿½?After scandals involving citywide lockdowns [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/world/asia/china-xian-lockdown-covid.html] in which people went hungry in their homes or even died for lack of medical care, notably in Xiâan, central government leaders have ordered local officials to use greater caution when imposing such restrictions. Premier Li Keqiang said in an annual policy speech last week that the goal of Chinaâs pandemic policies was âto protect peopleâs life and health, keep up the normal running of work and life, and ensure the security of industrial and supply chains.ï¿½?But the rapid increase in infections threatens to undo that progress. Dr. Zhang, the Shanghai expert, has been one of the few prominent advocates [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/business/covid-china-zhang-wenhong-coronavirus.html] of easing âCovid zeroï¿½?precautions, but even he said in an online posting on Monday that now is not the time for that. âIt is very important for our country to continue to adopt the strategy of covid-zero in the society in the near future to suppress the fifth wave of the extremely fast-spreading Omicron epidemic to a completely controllable level,ï¿½?he wrote. âBut this does not mean that we will permanently adopt the strategy of citywide lockdown and full testing.ï¿½?Shenzhen, a vast metropolis of nearly 20 million people that is Chinaâs tech center and adjacent to Hong Kong, locked down residents on Sunday night. It stopped buses and subways and ordered businesses to close except for supermarkets, farmersï¿½?markets, pharmacies, medical institutions and the port, which is one of the worldâs largest. Dongguan, another huge factory city that is next to Shenzhen, imposed a similar lockdown on Monday. Particularly in southern China, many have reacted to the Omicron outbreak by blaming nearby Hong Kong, where a large epidemic [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/13/world/asia/hong-kong-quarantine.html] has overwhelmed hospitals and morgues, largely because the vaccination of older residents has lagged. Hu Xijin, a nationalistic columnist, complained in a post on his social media account on Sunday: âHong Kong brought down Shenzhen.ï¿½?Li You, Amy Chang Chien, and Joy Dong contributed research.

861,0,Neil Young Demands Spotify Remove His Music -- 2nd Update,615 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"Mr. Young wasn't immediately available for comment. The letter came in response to ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast, which is currently Spotify's most popular podcast, and also tops Apple's podcasting charts. In 2020, Mr. Rogan signed an exclusive podcasting deal with Spotify, reportedly worth more than $100 million. ""With an estimated 11 million listeners per episode, JRE, which is hosted exclusively on Spotify, is the world's largest podcast and has tremendous influence. Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform, though the company presently has no misinformation policy,"" Mr. Young wrote in the letter. ""I want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform...They can have Rogan or Young. Not both."" Spotify and Joe Rogan didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Young's letter cited an episode of the podcast in which Mr. Rogan spoke with Dr. Robert Malone, a virologist who worked on research into several mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, but who is now critical of the treatments. Among the claims made was the suggestion that hospitals have been financially motivated to falsely diagnose deaths as having been caused by Covid-19. Mr. Rogan has regularly used his podcast to discuss Covid-19 vaccines and restrictions, railing against vaccine mandates for indoor events and suggesting that young, healthy people shouldn't be vaccinated. Spotify's bet on Mr. Rogan's show has caused trouble in the past for the audiostreaming company. Some employees expressed concern over the podcast's content during a town-hall meeting in September 2020, relating to material they felt was anti-transgender, according to people familiar with the matter. Earlier this month, a group of 270 scientists and healthcare professionals signed an open letter to Spotify accusing the podcast of ""promoting baseless conspiracy theories"" and asking the service to take action against mass-misinformation events on its platform. ""Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Joe Rogan has repeatedly spread misleading and false claims on his podcast, provoking distrust in science and medicine,"" it said. Mr. Young also launched his own streaming service in 2018 called the ""Neil Young Archives"" which offers different yearly subscriptions ranging from $19.99 to $99.99 to access the artist's albums. Mr. Young has previously had issues with streaming platforms. In 2015, he said he didn't need his content ""to be devalued by the worst quality in the history of broadcasting or any other form of distribution"" and that he was pulling his music from streaming services.

802,1,Airbnb's 135% Rally Takes IPO Crown With Room to Run; BANKING/FINANCE,514 words,Palm Beach Daily Business Review,"And investors have more reasons to stay bullish. Airbnb's stock is expected to climb by an average of 22% over the next 12 months with a majority of the 41 analysts covering the firm recommending investors hold on to their shares or buy more, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ""It is evolving, and becoming an interesting play with respect to work-from-home and long-term rental trends,"" said Thomas George, a portfolio manager at Grizzle Investment Management, which owns the stock. ""Those are additional levers it can unlock for growth."" Brokerages on average predict the company next month will report a 64% jump in first-quarter sales. Airbnb, which was profitable on a net-income basis the past two quarters, probably lost money again in the first three months of this year, analysts say. Its revenue grew 78% to $1.53 billion in the fourth quarter, beating analysts' projections as people spread out over thousands of towns and cities and stayed for weeks and months with workers no longer having to be in traditional offices five days a week. ""The benefits seen over the past year or so are expected to continue, especially as traveling increases with the pandemic hopefully continuing to wane,"" said Scott Kessler, an analyst at Third Bridge.  Airbnb's stock performance also has given it the title of best performer of any IPO to raise $1 billion or more since its debut, according Bloomberg data. This comes at a time where weak trading in recent IPOs has weighed on the listings pipeline. At $105 billion in market value, it's now the biggest online travel company, eclipsing Booking Holdings Inc., Expedia Group Inc. and Marriott International Inc. Some caution is warranted. Its stock rally has surpassed its peers by a mile in the travel industry since it went public, which could mean its upside is minimal. Booking has climbed 5.5%, Marriott is 29% higher and Expedia is up 44% in that time period. And it isn't cheap. Airbnb sells for about 12 times its estimated sales. That's well above its peers with Booking sitting at 5.3, and both Expedia's and TripAdvisor's are below 3. To be sure, shares of Airbnb more than doubled in value in its blockbuster debut and seen a more moderate growth rate since. The company has, however, fared better than other growth stocks as the market navigated through multiple tech sell-offs."

362,0,Big win for Packer as Crown agrees to sell,277 words,Daily Telegraph,"And for Mr Packer, the price is 10c higher than the aborted deal he struck with Macau gaming billionaire, Lawrence Ho, who agreed to pay $13 for a 19.99 per cent holding of Crown in 2019. After becoming a forced seller and seeing Crownâs shares plummet as low as $6.12 at the onset of the pandemic, Mr Packer has not only been able to save face but also secure a higher price. That extra 10c a share is an extra $25m in Mr Packerâs pocket. The Victorian royal commission into Crown last year recommended Mr Packer sell down his 37 per cent controlling stake in the group to 5 per cent within two years. Crown fronted three separate inquiries in NSW, Victoria and Western Australia amid explosive revelations it facilitated money laundering and other organised crime. Its licence for its Sydney casino at Barangaroo is still suspended after the NSW inquiry ruled it was unfit to run a casino. Shareholders are expected to vote on the proposal after March. But the deal is still subject to regulatory approval. terry McCrann page 49"

817,1,Sandvik - Closing the loop in digital manufacturing,846 words,ENP Newswire,"Sandvik has a long experience of optimizing machining processes, and we are now able to build this competence into software and routines,' says Nadine Crauwels, President of Sandvik Machining Solutions. 'From production planning and programming to tooling, manufacturing and quality control, digitalization comes in at every step and improves efficiency and along with that sustainability.' A big step forward One major leap on the digitalization journey came in 2020 with the acquisition of CGTech, a global market leader for numerical control (NC/CNC) simulation, verification and optimization. CGTech's product offering includes Vericut, a software program used for simulating CNC machining. 'It brought Sandvik Machining Solutions a big step forward towards offering full machining solutions for our customers. The pace of acquisitions accelerated in 2021, adding competence in digital manufacturing and software solutions. CNC Software is the company behind Mastercam, the most widely used computer aided manufacturing (CAM) brand with about 300,000 licenses installed. Cambrio is a leading company with an end-to-end portfolio in CAM software for manufacturing industries, and ICAM provides solutions that translate CAM data into optimized coding for guiding CNC machining operations. A closed-loop, end-to end production with non-touch inspection is the ultimate goal. In the verification phase, Sandvik made two acquisitions: DWFritz Automation with a leading position in in-line metrology and Dimensional Control Systems, a leading global provider of dimensional quality management software and on-site engineering services. 'Our long history and metal-cutting knowledge, combined with recent acquisitions, make Sandvik uniquely positioned to help customers of all sizes make the most of the digital transformation,' says Christophe Sut, President of Sandvik Manufacturing Solutions. 'A closed-loop, end-to end production with non-touch inspection is the ultimate goal.' The digital manufacturing process The end-to-end approach means that not just production, but data collection and even analytics will be automated. Sensor-embedded tools continuously monitor production, and quality control and verification of parts takes place in real time inside the machine. The opportunities for continuous learning - by machines as well as humans - are endless. We support companies in working with feedback loops, how they work with data and learn from every step in the process,' says Crauwels. 'We are now able to build this competence into software and routines that are automated and don't need to be in the head of an individual.' Optimization of the value chain includes interaction between software and hardware, 'The opposite is suboptimization,' she says. 'That's why Sandvik has chosen an agnostic approach, which means that our solutions work with software and hardware from other vendors as well.' Good for the planet, and good for business. Many Sandvik customers are small and middle-sized companies and the agnostic approach helps them digitalize their operations and stay competitive. 'Engineering keeps moving forward, triggering a need to develop more complex parts and to invent new solutions,' says Sut. 'More advanced manufacturing relies on digitalization to automate production and to maintain a high and even quality.' One example of the agnostic approach is that the industrial metrology solutions - which measure production results in real time inside the machine - work irrespective of who built the tools and the machines. 'The possibility to integrate measurement in the digital manufacturing process ensures that all components are of the right quality as they are produced,' says Sut. 'We are moving from measuring random samples in a quality-assurance measuring room to in-line. By not producing faulty components, we will use less energy and material. Good for the planet and good for business.' Strong link to sustainability Increased digitalization is strongly linked to sustainability, since efficient machine utilization and more accurate production results in less waste and fewer scrapped parts. Combined with increaing raw material and energy costs, production efficiency has a direct impact on the bottom line of customer financials as well as the climate. Looking ahead, Crauwels says Sandvik is on a strong growth path. 'Combining software and hardware creates new revenue streams and a subscription-based business model,' she says. 'By complementing our growth in our core business with knowledge-based digital solutions we are set for a successful and profitable business.' Sut agrees: 'The demand for our solutions is stronger than the general growth in the manufacturing sector, and many applications even show double-digit growth. It's a great market to be in right now.' Contact: Phone: +46 8 456 11 00 [Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk]"
544,0,"Grim reality of Britain ravaged by highest inflation for 30 years: Hotels close floors and bars to cope with soaring bills, supermarkets say rising prices mean customers are turning to food banks and factories warn they could shut",3827 words,Mail Online,"* Richard Walker, the boss of Iceland, said customers were turning to food banks Businesses today told of the grim impacts of soaring Inflation, with hotels forced to close floors to save money on energy bills, shops locked in a 'fight to survive' and Iceland warning rising prices were forcing customers to turn to food banks. The rate of Consumer Price Index inflation in Britain has increased by more than expected to 5.4 per cent - up from 5.1 per cent in November and its highest rate in 30 years, ONS data revealed today. Sadie Shard, who runs the Crescent Hotel in Scarborough, said she had gone from paying Â£2,000 a month to energy to Â£10,000. 'We've closed the bar a few times a week because we're not taking enough money to cover our energy bills, and we've been closing a few floors when there aren't guests there so we're not using any unnecessary gas,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'We've got no choice but to increase our prices. Usually in the winter months hotels drop their prices but we can't do that.' Richard Walker, managing director of Iceland, said that rising prices, a fall in real-term wages, tax rises, and a cut to Universal Credit top-ups had hit customers with a 'perfect storm' of problems. 'There has been an alarming increase in food branches in the country ï¿½?I think there are more food banks now than there are branches of McDonalds,' he said. 'This is no exaggeration: there are people out there facing the choice between eating and heating, and we are losing customers to hunger.' Mr Walker said he expected inflation to increase further, adding: 'We've been talking about inflation hitting food prices for some time, because it's occurring throughout the supply chain: everything from commodity prices, labour shortages, shipping and HGV driver costs, energy prices, national minimum wage increases, new types of taxation. 'Business is not some endless sponge that can forever soak up these costs so we'll see the effects on the shelf. It's the perfect storm for our consumers.' [related] Entrepreneur Luke Johnson said manufacturing businesses were particularly vulnerable to rising energy bills. 'At a manufacturing business I'm involved with which is a big energy user, we are facing a 40% increase in power costs - if this carries on factories will shut,' he told MailOnline. 'Green taxes add significantly to the cost burden and mean the UK isn't a competitive place to make things.' Other business owners told MailOnline they had been forced to repeatedly raise prices. Barry Whitehouse, owner of Banbury-based art shop, The Artery said: 'It is the perfect storm for small businesses. 'We are receiving letters from almost every supplier warning of impending price increases due to rising costs of raw materials, which they are now passing onto us, and which we also have no choice but to pass on to our customers. 'Slim margins and little buying power from a small indie will only further increase the gap between the online giants who can often afford to buy larger quantities and take the hit of price hikes.' Adam Bamford, co-founder of Derby-based corporate gift supplier Colleague Box said: 'I absolutely hate raising our prices but the reality is we are being left with no choice. 'Our suppliers having to pay more for all aspects of production leads to daily emails of price increases that put even greater strain on our business. 'We're not talking about profits any longer as it's a fight to survive rather than make money.' Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones, 64, who runs the popular Black Farmer food range, said: 'A lot of our products have been hit by inflation, especially chicken, which is up by between seven and ten per cent. 'There's a perfect storm going on at the moment. A lot of the Eastern Europeans who were allowed to stay with temporary visas that expired over Christmas have gone home, transport costs and energy bills are up, plus there's avian flu. 'We are now having to approach all retailers to ask for a price increase, but they are very resistant because they are in a price war with each other. 'Britain has the highest food standards in the world, and we are very tightly governed, as we should be, so the risk is that we could have lots of cheap imports coming in. 'A lot of the cheap chicken is flown over from Thailand or Poland, and it would churn people's stomach if they realised what conditions the chickens were kept in. 'So the British consumer has a big choice, they can either pay for good quality or pay less and the quality will suffer.' And Dawn Hopkins, owner of the Rose Inn in Norwich and vice chair of the Campaign for Pubs, said: 'Like everybody else we've seen big rises in our utilities, breweries, food suppliers, and then you couple that with our customers being hit too then it makes you worry for the future. 'I put my prices up late last year and it's going to be something I'm going to have to consider again this year.' Bank of England governor warns inflation will stay higher for longer than expected after it hit 30-year peak of 5.4% - but rules out interest rates returning to pre-financial crash levels By Mark Duell for MailOnline The governor of the Bank of England today warned inflation could last longer than first thought after it hit a 30-year high of 5.4% - as he ruled out interest rates returning to levels seen before the financial crash. Andrew Bailey told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee that financial markets now do not expect energy prices to start easing back until the the second half of 2023. Until a few months ago, wholesale gas prices had been expected to start falling next summer. He said it was a 'big shift' and suggested it may impact the Bank's expectations that higher levels of inflation would be only temporary. Part of the change in gas price expectations is down to rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine, he added. He told MPs: 'I have to be honest with you, that's a very great concern.' Mr Bailey also said oil prices have jumped 12% since the start of January. The hearing came as official figures on Wednesday showed inflation jumped to 5.4% in December - the highest level for almost 30 years. The Bank and its global counterparts have until now stuck to the view that many of the factors pushing inflation - such as global supply chain disruption and wholesale energy price rises - would be 'transitory'. Mr Bailey said there was a 'structural reason' for low interest rates both in the UK and across the world, based on the need for more investment to meet the demands of an ageing population and counter low productivity. Mr Bailey said the Bank's view was that nothing was taking place that would change this 'structural story'. 'So when I hear people say we could go back to the pre-financial crisis days I would counter that,' he said. 'That's not to say interest rates won't rise, it's to put it into context of how much.' Interest rates reached 5.5% on the eve of the financial crisis before plummeting as the Bank tried to encourage businesses to start spending again. The 5.4 per cent rate of Consumer Price Index inflation in Britain is up from 5.1 per cent in November, putting further pressure on already squeezed households as energy costs continued to soar. The current BoE base interest rate is currently just 0.25%. Today, research firm Capital Economics predicted it could go up to 1.54%. Household finances are under pressure as gas and electricity tariffs have also seen major rises and supply chain problems are pushing up costs across the economy. Pensioners will be particularly hard hit, with the scrapping of the triple lock meaning a planned 8.3 per cent increase will now only be a 3.1 per cent boost, just as the cost of essential goods surges more than 6 per cent. It comes after separate data yesterday revealed that wage growth was outstripped by inflation in November 2021 in more than a year - for the first time since July 2020. New official figures showed house prices by Â£25,000 last year and continued to climb even after the end of the stamp duty holiday. House prices surge Â£25k in a year and keep climbing Property prices surged 10 per cent annually in November 2021, according to the latest official figures. This marked a small increase in price inflation compared to October, when prices grew by 9.8 per cent, the Office for National Statistics' house price index shows. The average house price was Â£271,000 in November 2021, which is Â£25,000 higher than the same time last year. The figures confirm that house prices continued to climb, even after the stamp duty holiday finished at the end of September 2021. The tax break, which lowered home buyers' bills by up to Â£15,000, contributed to rapidly rising prices after it was introduced in July 2020. This was despite the cost of a home increasing by Â£10,000 more than the maximum tax break. Meanwhile, the cost of a Â£200,000 mortgage could rise by Â£1,200 a year if interest rates rise to one per cent. Unions have stepped up campaigns for pay rises following the latest inflation figures amid warnings of a 'cost-of-living catastrophe' for workers. The ONS said the price of goods produced by UK factories was up 9.3 per cent in the year to December - slightly down from the 9.4 per cent rise in the year to November. And the price of materials and fuels used by manufacturers rose 13.5 per cent in the year to December, down from the 15.2 per cent growth in the year to November. The inflation rises reflected a range of goods and services, with the biggest impact from food and drink, followed by restaurants, hotels, furniture and household goods. The 5.4 per cent figure was the highest since March 1992, when it was at 7.1 per cent. It adds pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates again next month. The Bank last month became the world's first major central bank to raise interest rates since the start of the pandemic, from 0.1 per cent to 0.25 per cent. The move, which was an attempt to try to cool the rampant inflation rate, came a day after data showed CPI had unexpectedly surged to a 10-year high in November. Inflation is also turning into a political problem for Boris Johnson, who is facing calls to offset an expected 50 per cent rise in regulated household energy prices in April. Responding to the rise in CPI inflation, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said today: 'I understand the pressures people are facing with the cost of living and we will continue to listen to people's concerns as we have done throughout the pandemic. 'We're providing support worth around Â£12billion this financial year and next to help families with the cost of living. 'We're cutting the Universal Credit taper to make sure work pays, freezing alcohol and fuel duties to keep costs down, and providing targeted support to help households with their energy bills.' The Bank forecasts CPI will peak at a 30-year high of around 6 per cent in April due to the higher energy bills, and that it will take more than two years for CPI to return to its 2 per cent target. Financial markets see a high chance that the Bank of England will raise rates again on February 3 and announce that it will allow its Â£875billion stock of government bonds to fall as the gilts begin to mature. Cost of Â£200,000 mortgage to rise Â£1,200 a year if rates hit 1pc - while research firm predicts they will hit 1.25pc Homeowners face a struggle to meet their mortgage repayments with steep rises on the horizon. Last month, the Bank of England increased the base rate from a record low of 0.1 per cent to 0.25 per cent, and further rises are expected in 2022 to help tame inflation. But any increase in the base rate means mortgage repayments become more onerous for millions on variable rates and tracker deals. Figures from broker L&C Mortgages show that if the base rate rose to 1 per cent, a household with a Â£200,000 mortgage would need to shell out an extra Â£1,200 per year compared with before the pandemic. Many households could struggle to meet mortgage repayments. Research firm Capital Economics predicted the base rate could go up to 1.54%. Armed Forces minister James Heappey said the Government is looking at what more can be done to help households with the cost of living crisis. He told BBC Breakfast that the rise in inflation was 'a cause for real concern', adding: 'The Government is looking at what more could and should be done. 'I don't know that viewers are necessarily learning anything new this morning because they would have seen the cost of their bills increasing over the course of the last few months. 'But it is a headline that reminds all of us in Government that there are millions of people out there who are concerned about their ability to heat their home, feed their families. 'That's why the Chancellor and the Business Secretary and the Prime Minister are looking at what the Government could and should be doing to help them.' Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning that there is a 'triple whammy' facing families. He said: 'You've got real wages and incomes, even for pensioners, falling because of inflation. You've got substantial tax rises. You've got huge rises in energy bills. 'It is our job to hold the Government to account and that is exactly what we're doing, and we're laying out serious costed alternative positions to take that would make a real difference to people's incomes. 'Again, I think that is in a very positive contrast to a Government which doesn't seem to be able to do anything other than try and defend itself. Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said today: 'The inflation rate rose again at the end of the year and has not been higher for almost 30 years. Black Wednesday and 15% interest rates: What happened in 1992? The Consumer Prices Index rate was at 5.4 per cent in December 2021 - the highest level since March 1992, when it stood at 7.1 per cent. This period followed the UK recession of 1991 which was caused by a toxic combination of high interest rates, plunging house prices and an overvalued exchange rate. The most famous point was Black Wednesday on September 16, 1992, when the UK left the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) and the pound devalued by a whopping 20 per cent - showing how much it was overvalued. The period followed the economic boom in the late 1980s which saw big economic growth, a rapid increase in house prices and rising inflation amid a time of high consumer confidence. The Government joined the ERM in 1990 with the intention of getting inflation back under control, but the economy then began to slow down and it became difficult to keep the pound at its exchange rate target against the Deutsche Mark. To keep the value up, the Government used foreign currency reserves to buy sterling and increase interest rates to as high as 15 per cent - but this was unsustainable and it had to leave the EMR and devalue the currency. There was a fall in house prices because many people could not afford soaring mortgage payments, which also then reduced household wealth and consumer confidence plunged. Unemployment rose to over 10 per cent in 1992, while house prices were falling at a rate of 10 per cent in 1990 as home repossession rates went up. 'Food prices again grew strongly while increases in furniture and clothing also pushed up annual inflation. 'These large rises were slightly offset by petrol prices, which despite being at record levels were stable this month, but rose this time last year. 'The closures in the economy last year have impacted some items but, overall, this effect on the headline rate of inflation is negligible.' Today's figures showed that core CPI - which excludes sometimes-volatile food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices - rose to a record high 4.2 per cent in December from November's 3.9 per cent. Retail price inflation - an older measure that the ONS says is no longer accurate, but which is still widely used by government and businesses - rose to 7.5 per cent in December from a 30-year high of 7.1 per cent in November. And the British Chambers of Commerce warned today that inflation will continue to soar in the coming months and could surpass the 6 per cent mark by April.  Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC, said this morning: 'Higher inflation is adding to the unprecedented surge in costs facing businesses. 'The cumulative effect of soaring energy bills, increasing input costs and a looming National Insurance hike means that firms are under mounting pressure to continue raising prices. 'Inflation will continue to soar in the coming months as surging energy prices, rising raw material costs and the reversal of the VAT reductions for hospitality push it well above 6 per cent by April.' She added that the surging inflation means a February interest rate rise 'may be inevitable', but 'raising rates too aggressively risks undermining confidence and will do little to dampen the global factors driving this current inflationary spike'. The ONS said food and drink prices lifted by 4.2 per cent year on year in December, which is the biggest rise since September 2013. Clothes shops also put up prices by an average 4.2 per cent. But the biggest hit to consumer pockets continues to be the rises in energy bills after an October increase to the price cap, with experts warning over a leap of more than 50 per cent in these costs when the next revision is due in April. Meanwhile, motorists have also faced painful fuel price rises, and the ONS said average petrol prices remained at a record high of 145.8 pence a litre last month, compared with 114.1 pence a litre a year earlier. Rising used car prices have been another factor in pushing up CPI since the beginning of 2020, according to the ONS. The figures showed that CPIH, which includes owner-occupiers' housing costs and is the ONS's preferred measure of inflation, was 4.8 per cent in December compared with 4.6 per cent in November and the highest since September 2008. Samuel Tombs, at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said December's inflation figures leave the Bank of England with 'little choice but to hike rates again in February'. He said CPI is likely to peak 'slightly above' 6 per cent in April. Unions demand wage rises to avoid 'cost-of-living catastrophe' Unions are stepping up campaigns for pay rises following the latest inflation figures amid warnings of a 'cost-of-living catastrophe' for workers. Unite said the true scale of the crisis has been revealed in the RPI rise of 7.5%, which it said is a more accurate figure than CPI. And it said the Government and employers cannot 'stand by and do nothing' and allow workers to pay the price for the pandemic. The union is pressing ahead with setting up its own index for measuring the cost of living and ability of employers to pay, saying it will become its benchmark for negotiations on wages and pensions. General secretary Sharon Graham said: 'Unless employers pay up and wages rise significantly, soaring inflation, including mounting energy costs, will create a cost-of-living catastrophe for workers. 'Anything less than a pay rise that meets soaring food, fuel and energy bills is a wage cut. Unite will make sure that those that can pay do pay. 'We are fed up of the Government's jiggery-pokery on the cost-of-living index, so we will be appointing the necessary experts to produce our own working index for inflation.' 'Nonetheless, we continue to expect CPI inflation to fall back swiftly after April and ultimately to undershoot the (Bank's) 2 per cent target in 2023,' he added. Property prices surged 10 per cent annually in November 2021, according to the latest official figures. This marked a small increase in price inflation compared to October, when prices grew by 9.8 per cent, the Office for National Statistics' house price index shows. The average house price was Â£271,000 in November 2021, which is Â£25,000 higher than the same time last year. The figures confirm that house prices continued to climb, even after the stamp duty holiday finished at the end of September 2021. The tax break, which lowered home buyers' bills by up to Â£15,000, contributed to rapidly rising prices after it was introduced in July 2020. This was despite the cost of a home increasing by Â£10,000 more than the maximum tax break. But current owners face a struggle to meet their mortgage repayments with steep rises on the horizon. Last month, the Bank of England increased the base rate from a record low of 0.1 per cent to 0.25 per cent, and further rises are expected in 2022 to help tame inflation.

671,1,GridX Announces $40 Million in Series C Funding and Appoints New CEO,1064 words,Business Wire,"GridX, the leading enterprise rate platform provider to modern utilities and energy technology companies, today announced it has closed $40 million in Series C funding led by Energy Impact Partners (EIP), a global investment platform leading the transition to a sustainable energy future. Moore Strategic Ventures (MSV), Sunfox Capital and NGP ETP also participated in the round with Hunter Horgan of MSV joining the company's board of directors. GridX also announced that Chris Black has been appointed CEO of GridX. Both moves aim to speed the clean energy transition by accelerating the development of GridX's leading rate analytics and complex billing solutions, and building out its sales and marketing, product, and engineering teams. ""Following our initial investment in GridX in 2021, the imperative to eliminate carbon from our economy has grown leaps and bounds,"" said Lindsay Luger, Co-Founder & Partner, Energy Impact Partners. ""While solutions to this generational challenge are still emerging, one thing is certain -- electrification, adoption of distributed energy resources and increasingly complex rate structures demand the type of advanced analytics solutions provided by GridX."" The energy industry is undergoing the largest transition since the advent of electricity. Utilities around the world have committed to dramatically reducing or eliminating carbon from our economy over the next 30 years. Critical to that effort is electrifying transportation and heating, increasing the adoption of distributed energy resources like smart thermostats, solar, and storage, and helping customers shift their usage to times of the day when energy is most sustainable. GridX sits at the intersection of these trends with analytics solutions that manage the deployment of increasingly complex rate structures.

Today, GridX works with some of the most innovative utilities and retail energy suppliers across North America, including Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, PSEG Long Island, and Consumers Energy, to serve more than 19 million homes and businesses. ""I can't think of a more exciting industry to be in as energy professionals are literally reinventing the way we power our daily lives, "" said Chris Black, CEO, GridX. ""But with these innovations come increased complexity from the exponential growth in distributed energy resources like solar and electric vehicles. Unfortunately, this complexity is most often felt by energy consumers because we've struggled to translate the impact of these technologies into dollars and cents so people know exactly what they can expect to pay. Communicating energy impact is easy but conveying the bill impact is incredibly hard. GridX is unique in its ability to do exactly this for anyone with an energy value proposition to homes and businesses."" Chris brings nearly 30 years of technology and operational expertise to GridX, most recently serving as a principal partner at Huck Capital, an investment firm at the forefront of building the next generation of sustainable, tech-enabled energy providers. Prior to that, he was CTO and COO at Tendril, an early pioneer and eventual leader in the home energy management space. While at Tendril, Chris was instrumental in executing an aggressive strategy to acquire the leading companies in the space to form a new entity. That company -- Uplight -- is now the industry's leading technology partner for providers transitioning to the clean energy ecosystem. About GridX, Inc.

Further, the product approval momentum has also slowed down with only 17 approvals received in the last financial year versus 34 in FY21. Companyâs product pipeline is strong with 91 ANDA pending approvals which provides growth visibility over the medium to long term. However, in the near term, price erosion and slower product approvals could slow down the momentum, according to analysts. Currency headwinds to impact Russia business The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war is a major concern for Dr Reddyâs as its revenue from Russia accounts for around 10% of overall sales. A major chunk of sales from the Russia region is from the OTC segment. While Russia sales in local currency have normalised, the depreciating Ruble against the Indian Rupee is likely to impact the regionâs performance. ""As the geopolitical situation is dynamic, we await further clarity to gauge the medium to long-term effect on the companyâs performance. That said, near-term performance is likely to be affected by adverse currency movements,"" the Sharekhan analysts said. India business to sustain double-digit growth trajectory Dr Reddy has been doing well in India with sales consistently outperforming IPM growth with 15.5% on-year growth in FY21 and 29% growth in 9MFY22. Going ahead, the management expects the double-digit growth trajectory to sustain. In India, the pharma company is present across chronics and acute therapy and has outperformed the industryâs growth. On MAT basis in therapy areas of gastro, cardiac, derma, anti-infective and anti-diabetes, the pain and respiratory segments have underperformed, which are now expected to pick up.

Dr Reddyâs stock rating: BuyTarget price: Rs 5,550; Upside 27% Sharekhan retained Buy call on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 5,550. ""Dr Reddyâs faces headwinds in the form of continued pricing pressures in the US business. This coupled with delayed product approvals could slow down US sales growth in the near term, while a strong product pipeline provides long-term visibility,"" the brokerage said. However, Dr Reddyâs Q4FY2022 performance is expected to be weak, given the elevated cost pressures leading to expected margin contraction.

494,1,National Retail Federation: March Retail Sales Grew Despite Higher Inflation,733 words,Contify Retail News,"âMarch retail sales show that consumers have maintained their ability to spend in the face of record-level inflation, supply chain issues and geopolitical unrest,ï¿½?NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said. âConsumers are adapting and shopping smarter for themselves and their families. We believe the strength of the consumer can carry the economy through this considerable economic uncertainty if policymakers implement measured policies and do not overreact to current conditions.ï¿½?âWhile prices soared in March and eroded spending power, shoppers remained resilient and sales were healthy,ï¿½?NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said. âConsumers have the willingness to spend and their ability to do so has been supported by rapid hiring, increased wages, larger-than-usual tax refunds and the use of credit. They are largely dealing with the shock of gas prices but will be facing higher interest rates as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy in the coming months. The challenge for the Fed is to cool off demand without pushing the economy into a dramatic slowdown.ï¿½?The U.S. Census Bureau today said overall retail sales in March were up 0.5 percent seasonally adjusted from February and up 6.9 percent year over year. That compared with increases of 0.8 percent month over month and 18.2 percent year over year in February. Despite occasional month-over-month declines, sales have grown year over year every month since May 2020, according to Census data.  NRFâs calculation of retail sales ï¿½?which excludes automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants to focus on core retail ï¿½?showed March was unchanged seasonally adjusted from February but up 4 percent unadjusted year over year. In February, sales were down 0.7 percent month over month but up 13.2 percent year over year.  NRFâs numbers were up 8.6 percent unadjusted year over year on a three-month moving average as of March. That is consistent with NRFâs forecast that 2022 retail sales will increase between 6 percent and 8 percent to total between $4.86 trillion and $4.95 trillion. March sales were up in all but two categories on both a monthly and yearly basis, with year-over-year gains led by grocery, clothing and furniture stores. Specifics from key sectors include: * Grocery and beverage stores were up 1 percent month-over-month seasonally adjusted and up 7.9 percent unadjusted year-over-year. * Clothing and clothing accessory stores were up 2.6 percent month-over-month seasonally adjusted and up 7.5 percent unadjusted year-over-year. * Furniture and home furnishings stores were up 0.7 percent month-over-month seasonally adjusted and up 4.2 percent unadjusted year-over-year. * General merchandise stores were up 5.4 percent month-over-month seasonally adjusted and up 3.9 percent unadjusted year-over-year. * Online and other non-store sales were down 6.4 percent month-over-month seasonally adjusted but up 2.6 percent unadjusted year-over-year. * Building materials and garden supply stores were up 0.5 percent month-over-month seasonally adjusted and up 1.8 percent unadjusted year-over-year. * Health and personal care stores were down 0.3 percent month-over-month seasonally adjusted but up 0.9 percent unadjusted year-over-year. * Sporting goods stores were up 3.3 percent month-over-month seasonally adjusted but down 5.7 percent unadjusted year-over-year. * Electronics and appliance stores were up 3.3 percent month-over-month seasonally adjusted but down 9.6 percent unadjusted year-over-year.

378,0,All about my motherland,803 words,The Globe and Mail,"I was both fairly sure what Parallel Mothers might be and eager to be surprised. Thankfully, Almodovar delivers on both fronts ï¿½?as Almodovar should almost always be entrusted to do. Part tear-stained Technicolor melodrama and part furious cultural excavation, Parallel Mothers rests somewhere near the mid- to upper-tier of Peak Almodovar. There are slight, barely perceivable cracks in its foundations, but mostly this is rock-solid cinema that will give you renewed life. It is all the more impressive given that it arrives from a filmmaker who, nearly five decades in the game, remains at the height of his powers. Indeed, there is a sense of career-long catharsis watching Parallel Mothers, as if the filmmaker has been patiently waiting to tell this particular story since he first picked up a camera. (There is physical evidence to prove this theory half-true: a fictional poster for the movie appears in the background of his 2009 film Broken Embraces.) Certainly, there are familiar Almodovarisms: desperate women, twists of fate and an unceasing fascination with mothers, mothers, mothers. But for the first time in the director's filmography ï¿½?work that was birthed in the hedonistic heyday of La Movida (âThe Happening"") that followed Francisco Franco's death ï¿½?Almodovar is directly confronting the chaos of the Spanish Civil War and the shadow it continues to cast over his country's psyche. As the title implies, Parallel Mothers tells two tales concurrently. The first involves photographer Janis (Penelope Cruz), who befriends the teenage Ana (Milena Smit) in the hospital while they both await the deliveries of their first-borns. Years later, Janis and Ana reconnect, but only after tragedy has struck both women. While this drama, tinged with elements of both black comedy and psycho-sexual thriller, plays out, Almodovar keeps returning to Janis's long-held quest to unearth the remains of her great-grandfather, who was âdisappeared"" by Franco-affiliated rebels. Eventually, a story about motherhood becomes a story about cultural memory, with Almodovar gleefully but respectfully mixing the themes together until they coalesce into one singular treatise on the responsibility we have to recognize, and never forget, our own mistakes. Throughout Parallel Mothers, Almodovar runs the risk of derailing his drama by insisting to keep Spain's painful history at the forefront. Does he want audiences to become lost in one of his signature melodramas ï¿½?set-designed with eye-popping detail and acted with red-hot intensity by a cast of regular collaborators ï¿½?or does he want to shake his countrymen from what he views as a sort of societal amnesia? Both, actually, and somehow he pulls the balancing act off. There is even a moment mid-film in which he addresses the tension that he himself created, with Ana confronting Janis over her obsession with finding the bones of a man who's been dead for decades. âYou have to look at the future,"" Ana says, âotherwise you'll just open old wounds!"" The thing is, opening old wounds ï¿½?albeit of the personal, not societal, nature ï¿½?has been Almodovar's specialty forever. Cruz, whose presence here marks her seventh time working with Almodovar, goes beyond typical excellence. As Janis confronts traumas both contemporary and historical, the actor must portray both victim and crusader, all without falling to pieces. It is a remarkable performance that should live in the hall of Almodovar's many great women on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Relative newcomer Smit, meanwhile, acquits herself well as the fragile Ana, especially given that she must face off against a cadre of Almodovar's favourite actors (not only Cruz, but also regulars Rossy de Palma and Julieta Serrano). Toward the film's end, when Janis and Ana stare directly at the histories of their own shared lives and the history of their country, Parallel Mothers' twin purposes merge into something just shy of profound. It is a moment, and movie, that just might save your soul, too. Parallel Mothers opens Feb. 11 in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver theatres."

797,1,"British Airways offering GBP1,000 bonus to attract cabin crew staff amid COVID-19 staff shortage",260 words,FinancialWire,"Reportedly, airlines and airports are struggling to find new staff after making steep cuts at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.  BA and other airlines have been forced to cancel flights due to resurging demand ahead of Easter and not enough staff. One barrier to recruitment is that airline workers have to pass stringent security checks which can take several weeks or months to process. According to BA, applicants must have an airside ID for either Heathrow or London Stansted Airport as well as having completed cabin crew safety training, suggesting the company will look to rival airlines for staff. It also says that cabin crew who are not able to commence training prior to July 2022 if, for example, they have to work a long notice period, âmay not be eligible for the welcome bonusï¿½? Since the beginning of the year, BA has cancelled about 1,200 flights due to staff shortages and COVID-19 related absences.

The closure of all McDonaldâs sites in Russia was announced on Tuesday, in response to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The companyâs president and CEO Chris Kempczinski said: ""The conflict in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis in Europe has caused unspeakable suffering to innocent people.

791,0,News Corp. targeted by hackers with suspected ties to China,773 words,Washington Post.com,"The cyberattack has been contained, the media giant said, and did not affect systems housing subscriber information. In a note to employees on Friday, two News Corp. executives said the attack affected ""a limited number of business email accounts and documents"" from the company's headquarters, as well as from the Dow Jones publishing company that distributes the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, and News UK. Journalists were among those whose email accounts were accessed, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it. ""Even though the vast majority of our people's emails and documents were not the target of this attack activity, we take seriously any attack on our organization and our employees, including our journalists,"" wrote Chief Technology Officer David Kline and Chief Information Security Officer Billy O'Brien. They said the news organization ""will not tolerate attacks on our journalism, nor will we be deterred from our reporting, which provides readers everywhere with the news that matters."" Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in a statement that he was not familiar with the information in these reports but that China is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and has long been the victim of cyberattacks. ""Identifying the source of cyber attacks is a complex technical issue,"" Liu said. ""We hope that there can be a professional, responsible and evidence-based approach to identifying cyber-related incidents, rather than making allegations based on speculations."" Security experts and U.S. law enforcement officials say China has employed hackers for years to collect intellectual property and other sensitive data from a range of U.S. companies and institutions. The FBI has more than 2,000 open investigations focused on the ways Beijing is trying to steal information and technology, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said Tuesday in a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley, Calif. ""There is just no country that presents a broader threat to our ideas, our innovation, and our economic security than China,"" Wray said. Officials in both China and the United States have warned against cyberattacks from the other as the relationship has grown fraught in recent years. Washington has long accused Beijing of cyberattacks motivated by economic espionage, as well as surveillance of political targets. Beijing says it's the victim, not the perpetrator, of cyberattacks. U.S. news organizations have reported hacks against journalists with suspected ties to China over the years. In 2015, reporters writing about the Defense Department, the White House and the CIA for The Washington Post received letters saying their personal information may have been stolen. U.S. officials said privately at the time that the hackers were with the Chinese government. In 2013, the New York Times and the Journal reported they were the targets of cyberattacks from China. China expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters in February 2020, ostensibly in retaliation for a column headline the government deemed to be racist, amid frosty U.S.-China relations. The move followed a decision by the United States a day earlier to designate five major Chinese media outlets as government entities. News Corp. noted in its regulatory filing Friday that cyberattacks have ramped up in recent years, adding that its defenses have been made more complicated by remote work during the pandemic. It said hackers exploited a cloud-based system operated by an unnamed third party. ""Such attacks are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against,"" the company wrote. ""As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work and remote access to the Company's systems has increased significantly, which may adversely impact the effectiveness of the Company's security measures. Consequently, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase, particularly as the Company's digital businesses expand."""

993,1,HSBC Goes on Hiring Spree in Asia -- WSJ,879 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"""Asia is where we are doubling down our efforts, not only because Asia wealth is growing twice as fast as the rest of the world, but also because we are 'the bank of Asia,'"" said Nuno Matos, the chief executive of HSBC's wealth and personal banking division. The unit caters to some 38 million customers world-wide, from holders of regular checking accounts to ultrarich clients with more than $30 million to invest. It spans areas such as insurance, wealth management and private banking, plus retail-banking businesses like mortgages and credit cards. About one-third of customers are in Asia, Mr. Matos said. In an interview, Mr. Matos said the bank hired about 1,200 people in its Asia wealth business last year and was likely to add more or less as many this year. That includes lifting the number of wealth planners at Pinnacle, its branchless onshore wealth business in China, he said, to 1,000 or more from about 700. The expansion shows HSBC is pushing ahead with its plan, detailed last year, to hire more than 5,000 people, including some 3,000 at Pinnacle, to work with rich clients in the region. More broadly, HSBC said last year it would invest more than $3.5 billion over five years to expand its Asian wealth business, as part of a $6 billion plan to sharpen its focus on the region. Mr. Matos said the onshore venture now has some 200,000 registered users of its app, River, which offers market analysis as well as tools such as a family expenses tracker and a retirement calculator. HSBC hopes to convert app users into bank clients by referring them to Pinnacle wealth planners.  HSBC is placing long-term bets on China and Asia against a challenging backdrop. Global markets have been rattled by the war in Ukraine, rapid inflation and a shift toward tighter U.S. monetary policy. Meanwhile, widespread Covid-19 lockdowns in China are weighing on an economy that has already weathered a series of corporate crackdowns. The World Bank recently cut its forecast for growth in China's gross domestic product this year to 5%, from 5.4% six months ago, and warned that a tougher scenario could cut that to just 4%. Stock markets in mainland China and Hong Kong have both pulled back this year, after declines in 2021. Weaker markets could dent demand for certain kinds of investment products. The ranks of Asia's wealthy are growing rapidly -- for example, last year Credit Suisse estimated that by 2025 China would be home to 10.2 million millionaires, 93% more than in 2020. But while HSBC has deep roots in the region, it is far from alone in chasing this growing market.  Citigroup Inc. is also hiring thousands of staff, and targeting a big increase in the assets it manages for clients in Asia, while paring back its consumer-banking operations. The Swiss sector heavyweight UBS Group AG is also intent on capturing growth in Asian wealth, as well as in the U.S. Wealth clients in China have increasingly complex demands, said Mr. Matos. ""We are seeing a shift every year, where customers are now being much more conscious of the need to invest in more-sophisticated products. That could be equity, mutual funds, fixed income,"" or even alternative assets for high-net-worth clients, he said. And Asian clients are diversifying globally, rather than investing solely in the region, he said.  HSBC has struck a series of deals recently to bolster its offerings in Asia. These include acquiring AXA SA's Singapore operations for about $529 million and securing approval to take full control of an onshore Chinese life-insurance business. In India, it has agreed to buy L&T Investment Management Ltd. for $425 million. It could also lift its stake in an Indian insurance affiliate to 49% from 26%, the prospective seller said in February. ""We will always be looking for bolt-on acquisitions, bespoke acquisitions, provided that they deliver value for shareholders, they acquire scale, they acquire capabilities,"" Mr. Matos said. Mr. Matos worked at Banco Santander SA before joining HSBC in 2015. He became CEO of the unit in February 2021, and moved to Hong Kong later in the year, as part of a push by HSBC to locate more of its top executives in what HSBC Chief Executive Noel Quinn called ""key growth regions.""

""Freedom of expression does not cover war propaganda. For too long, content from Russia Today and other Russian state media has been amplified by algorithms and proposed as 'recommended content' to people who had never requested it,"" Breton said in a statement after the video call. ""War propaganda should never be recommended content - what is more, it should have no place on online platforms at all. I count on the tech industry to take urgent and effective measures to counter disinformation,"" he said. Breton said the companies' terms and conditions for users should be expanded to include war propaganda, giving them the power to kick violators off their platforms. The commission said there was agreement to adapt and update the platforms' policies in view of the current situation.  European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova also took part in the video call. ""I expect YouTube and Google to step up efforts to address Russian war propaganda. Russia has weaponised information, this is why platforms cannot be a space for its war lies,"" she said in a statement.  Google said it had already taken unprecedented steps to halt disinformation on Ukraine. ""As we said to the Commissioners, our teams continue to monitor the situation around the clock and are ready to take further action,"" a Google spokesperson said. Banning accounts promoting war propaganda could be problematic, however, because of the difficulty of defining what constitutes propaganda and from whose perspective.

Normally, these positions are mostly recruited vis the armed forcesï¿½?internal recruitment offices.

713,1,Experts see peak of inflation approaching,650 words,USA Today,"After six months of steady advances in the consumer price index (CPI), the past five of which set fresh four-decade highs, the yearly rises should slowly decline through 2022, the economists say. And though prices will continue to move higher month to month, the increases should be less dramatic. Such a scenario would still squeeze U.S. households struggling to keep up with ever-climbing costs. And economists believe inflation will remain an uncomfortably high 5% or so by year's end. But it would at least feel as if the country were on the downhill side of a forbidding mountain. ""While people won't feel it immediately and prices are still rising there will be a psychological effect,"" says Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. That could affect consumers' inflation expectations, which in turn may help quell inflation by moderating workers' demands for higher wages. But some economists say inflation could drift still higher over the next couple of months.  Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics believes inflation will peak near 9% in May before starting to abate. And she says price increases will need to ease significantly before they start changing Americans' inflation expectations. A big reason experts see inflation starting to ease soon: Prices began rising sharply last spring and summer, and so the annual increase from a year ago will start to decrease because of simple math. To avoid another all-time high and begin what could be a gradual descent, April's monthly increase in the CPI needs to stay below 0.8%, Daco says. What causes inflation? What happens to gasoline prices could be key. The CPI jumped 1.2% last month ï¿½?a 17-year high ï¿½?and pump prices accounted for two-thirds of the increase as they surged 18.3%. Oil and gas prices, though, have fallen in recent weeks. If they rise less than 8% or so in April from the prior month, overall inflation would start heading down, assuming other costs don't increase more than they did last month, Daco says. Used car prices will be another barometer. They declined for the second straight month in March, slipping nearly 4%, but are still up 35.3% over the past year. If much of the demand for used cars has been satisfied, as Daco suspects, that could go a long way toward keeping a lid on the broad price index. Bostjancic is warier, noting used car prices ""have been choppy."" Crude prices edged back over $100 a barrel late Tuesday, she notes, and wholesale gasoline prices rose about 15 cents a gallon. ""Today's gains showed the fickle nature of what might be called a broken market,"" says Tom Kloza, chief global analyst for the Oil Price Information Service. ""I'm afraid inflation in oil is with us for this quarter and next, but it will be a roller-coaster ride."" Will food prices go up in 2022? Bostjancic also worries about a rise in food prices and a shift in consumer purchases from goods to services as the pandemic fades. The latter could further push up costs for airfares and hotels, which rose 10.7% and 3.3%, respectively, in March. Then there's Russia's war in Ukraine, which could continue to disrupt supply chains and drive energy and wheat prices ï¿½?chief exports from the region ï¿½?higher, Daco and Bostjancic say. In other words, inflation may well have peaked, but it may drift higher in the next month or two. In an era marked by pandemic and war, ""there's so much uncertainty,"" Bostjancic says."
864,1,"Nigeriaâs Kudi, Africaâs Financial Technology Company, Changes Name to Nomba",1126 words,M2 Presswire,"This solution could not have come at a more opportune time. From neighborhood kiosks to high-brow restaurants and fashion stores, the small business segment in Nigeria is responsible for 86 percent of the total workforce through 41 million micro-businesses and 73,000 small and medium enterprises as indicated by the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) National Survey. Yet, payments in the retail sector in Nigeria are largely offline with over 25 million merchants yet to accept any form of digital payments. Many of the retail businesses who do accept digital payments lack a unified platform to seamlessly manage their businesses across multiple touch-points and locations. From payment collection, to trade financing, to intelligent business reporting, and even multiple location management, businesses largely depend on traditional financial services providers who do not provide the ecosystem of services that support their businesses. Having all of this on one platform will really make a difference and make business easier. With Nomba, underserved and full-fledged businesses can self-onboard in five minutes and order a full-service integrated terminal and dashboard designed to manage all their payment needs whether in cash, cards, transfers, USSD or QR across multiple channels and locations. Over the next six months, Nomba will extend the penetration of its POS terminals across the country, giving more businesses access to technology that delivers real-time oversight of all business transactions whether they are a one-man business or a corporate, all on one dashboard. It also plans to expand its product offerings into invoicing, payroll management and other tools that boost the productivity of businesses. To drive this expansion, the fintech has appointed two key new executives Jeffrey Williams as Vice President, Business, and Toluwani Ijogun as Vice President Brand, Marketing and Communications. Harnessing their experience and expertise, Nomba, will accelerate its expansion across the country ensuring that over 350,000 businesses are equipped with all the tools required to run their businesses seamlessly, by the end of the year. As VP, Brand Marketing and Communications, Toluwani Ijogun will be responsible for brand strategy, including all consumer, business-to-business and partner marketing activities that advance the companyâs goals. She will also oversee all internal and external communications, insights and marketing capabilities and analytics for the brand. Toluwani brings with her over 15 years experience managing premium brands such as Guaranty Trust Bank; GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Plc; Philips across West Africa; Eat Nï¿½?Go (owners of Dominoâs Pizza and Coldstone Creamery franchise in Nigeria); FSDH Group and most recently as Senior Vice President: Brand and Marketing for Kuda Bank where she played a pivotal role in the companyâs growth in the Nigerian market. Jeffrey Williams-Edem brings over 18 years of experience in sales, business development strategy, digital payment and merchant acquisition spanning multiple industries. He joins Nomba as VP, Business from Interswitch where he played an integral role in the design and deployment of their first retail solution strategy for the micro, small and medium enterprise market in Nigeria. As Kudi transitions to Nomba, Jeffrey will be responsible for creating and driving the machinery to deliver on business acquisition, new market development and revenue. He will also oversee the sales, business operations and the development of new products. âSince our launch in 2017, our technology and insights have enabled merchants to earn and build successful businesses, transforming their own lives and that of others. Today, complimentary regulatory frameworks and well-thought-out partnerships with financial institutions have synergized to create an enabling environment for fintechs to chart the future of payments, making access to digital payment solutions ubiquitous. Over the next five years, we will be leveraging these factors, as well as the experience and expertise Jeff and Tolu bring to deepen the penetration of digital payment solutions across the country, making payments easier for everyone,ï¿½?said Yinka Adewale, Chief Executive Officer, Nomba. Nomba started its journey in 2017 as a chatbot designed to simplify payments. However, in 2018 it evolved into a company whose distinct point of sale (POS) technology, partnerships with banks and other licensed financial institutions democratized access to banking products and services for merchants across Nigeria. This also includes core banking solutions such as opening savings accounts and loans. Listed as a YCombinator Top Company in 2022, there are today over 150,000 businesses on the Nomba platform enabled to carry out card, cash and bank transfer related transactions for their own businesses and on behalf of their customers. With an onboarding rate of over 10,000 new businesses monthly, Nomba currently processes over $16m in payments daily across more than 500,000 unique transactions.

For media enquiries: Toju Grage Nomba Brand, Marketing and Communications E:toju.grage@kudi.com Website:www.Nomba.com [http://www.Nomba.com]  About Nomba: We are building an ecosystem that simplifies how businesses accept payments, make payments and manage operations. This journey started in 2016 with simplifying access to financial services using âKudi.aiï¿½?a chatbot integration that responds to financial requests on social apps. It then morphed into powering a community of independent businesses who act as neighborhood banks offering basic financial services such as cash withdrawal, transfer and bill payments to all Nigerians, especially those in underserved communities. We currently processes over $16m in payments daily across more than 500,000 unique transactions and have over 150,000 businesses on our platform. We believe this technology and innovative solution can power all kinds of businesses whether they are accepting payments for goods and services or helping others access cash or send money. So, we created easy-to-use tools with flexible options for all kinds of businesses to accept, process and manage payments online and offline. As we stay through to our mission to make financial services accessible and affordable, we are one step closer to bringing a lasting change to Africa and Africaâs commerce.

There have been some international names floating around,' he said."
682,1,Mithra Announces Improved Consolidated Topline Results from Donesta Phase 3 Studies and Launch of Recruitment for the Extension of European Study,1069 words,Contify Life Science News,"- DonestaÂ® safety profile confirmed by independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), which recommended to continue the Phase III Clinical Program - Launch of the recruitment of the additional 300 menopausal women thanks to a successful mitigation plan  Mithra (Euronext Brussels: MITRA), a company dedicated to Womenâs Health today announces consolidated positive topline results of Phase 3 DonestaÂ® Program. DonestaÂ® is Mithraâs next generation orally-administrated estetrol (E4)-based hormone therapy product candidate offering a potential long-term solution for treating different symptoms of menopause, simultaneously or sequentially, caused by estrogen loss. All four co-primary endpoints met On 14 January 2022, Mithra announced the first efficacy data of DonestaÂ® Phase 3 Program, which demonstrated a meaningful reduction in vasomotor symptoms (VSM) from baseline and compared to placebo[1]. After further in-depth analysis of all the research data consolidated by the Contract Research Organization in charge of the management of the DonestaÂ® studies, Mithra is particularly pleased to announce that the efficacy results are even better than previously announced. This consolidated analysis showed that all co-primary efficacy endpoints[2] were statistically (all p<0.05) met in both studies. Even in the C302 study, the result for the severity criteria reached statistical significance at week 4, and not at week 5 as initially reported. Launch of Recruitment for Extension European Study  Mithra also announces today the initiation of the recruitment of 300 additional menopausal non- hysterectomised women for its DonestaÂ® European Study (C301), following the decision of the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The experts of the DSMB completed the first 2022 quartely safety assessment of the Phase 3 Clinical Program of DonestaÂ® and recommended to continue the studies, allowing Mithra to launch the recruitment for the extension of the European study[3]. Thanks to the implementation of our mitigation plan activated immediately after the beginning of the geopolitical crisis in Eastern Europe, all the Russian sites originally selected for participating in the study were replaced by other sites to ensure a direct start of recruitment. The recruitment of these 300 women should be completed within the next 6 months. Barring any unforeseen event, Mithra confirms its ambition to achieve marketing authorization for DonestaÂ® in H1 2024 for the United States and in H2 2024 for Europe. The DonestaÂ® Phase III Clinical Program is still ongoing with patients completing a treatment duration for 52 weeks. The primary safety data are anticipated at the end 2022 for the North American study (C302) and for end H2 2023 for the European study (C301).  Leon Van Rompay, CEO Mithra Womenâs Health, commented: âThese excellent efficacy results demonstrates that DonestaÂ® should offer the most complete profile of symptom relief compared to any of the existing or pipeline therapies for menopause symptom treatment. By the end of the year we will be able to demonstrate again the unique safety profile of E4, building further on the fantastic potential of this molecule. From the very beginning of the geopolitical crisis, our teams have immediately activated a mitigation plan allowing us to launch the recruitment of the additional European study right after the DSMB's green light. Despite the current economical and geopolitical context, we donât expect any delay for the obtention of the marketing authorizations, which demonstrates that Mithraâs teams remain fully focused on our achievements and strongly committed to converting the potential of our products into success.ï¿½?About E4 Comfort Phase 3 Program DonestaÂ® phase III Clinical Program âE4 Comfortï¿½?carried out on 2,300 postmenopausal women (40-65 years) includes 2 pivotal studies: one in America (NCT04090957-C302); and a second spread over 14 countries in Europe, Russia and America (NCT04209543 -C301). Both studies are worldwide randomized, multicenter, double- blind, placebo-controlled trials. Each studies is composed of an efficacy and a safety part. The efficacy part in each studies is designed to evaluate the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in both hysterectomized and non- hysterectomized postmenopausal participants after treatment with two doses of E4 (15 mg or 20 mg) or placebo for 12 consecutive weeks. For endometrial protection, all non-hysterectomized subjects will receive treatment with 200 mg progesterone (P4) once daily for 14 consecutive days, after completion of the E4/placebo treatment. The safety part of the C302 study is designed to evaluate the general safety and secondary endpoints (health- related quality of life, treatment satisfaction, hemostasis, lipid and glucose metabolism, breast density and endometrial safety) in hysterectomized and non-hysterectomize women after treatment with E4 20 mg for one year. The safety part of the C301 study is designed to evaluate the endometrial safety of E4 20 mg in combination with continuous administration of 100 mg P4 in non-hysterectomized women for one year.

527,0,Japan widens virus restrictions as omicron surges in cities,950 words,Associated Press Newswires,"While many Japanese adults are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, few have gotten a booster shot, which has been a vital protection from the highly contagious omicron variant of the coronavirus. The Health Ministry on Friday approved Pfizer vaccinations for children aged 5-11, who are increasingly vulnerable to infection. Throughout the pandemic, Japan has resisted the use of lockdowns to limit the spread of the virus and has focused on requiring eateries to close early and not serve alcohol, and on urging the public to wear masks and practice social distancing, as the government seeks to minimize damage to the economy. Under the latest measures, most eateries are asked to close by 8 or 9 p.m., while large events can allow full capacity if they have anti-virus plans. In Tokyo, certified eateries that stop serving alcohol can stay open until 9 p.m. while those serving alcohol must close an hour earlier. Restaurants that close at 9 p.m. and don't serve alcohol receive 30,000 yen ($263) per day in government compensation, while those that close at 8 p.m. get 25,000 yen ($220) per day. Critics say the measures, which almost exclusively target bars and restaurants, make little sense and are unfair. Mitsuru Saga, the manager of a Japanese-style âizakayaï¿½?restaurant in downtown Tokyo, said he chose to serve alcohol and close at 8 p.m. despite receiving less compensation from the government. âWe cannot make business without serving alcohol,ï¿½?Saga said in an interview with Nippon Television. âIt seems only eateries are targeted for restraints.ï¿½?Some experts question the effectiveness of placing restraints only on eateries, noting that infections show no signs of slowing in the three prefectures that have already been subjected to the measures for nearly two weeks. After more than two years of repeated restraints and social distancing requests, Japanese are increasingly becoming less cooperative to such measures. People are back to commuting on packed trains and shopping at crowded stores. Tokyo's main train station of Shinagawa was packed as usual with commuters rushing to work Friday morning. Japan briefly eased border controls in November but quickly reversed them to ban most foreign entrants when the omicron variant began spreading in other countries. Japan says it will stick to the stringent border policy through the end of February as the country tries to reinforce medical systems and treatment. The tough border controls have triggered criticism from foreign students and scholars who say the measures are not scientific. A group of scholars and Japan-U.S. experts recently launched a petition, led by Japan Society head Joshua Walker, calling on Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and his government to allow foreign scholars and students to enter the country again under careful preventive measures. A letter to Kishida, signed by hundreds of academics and experts in Japan-U.S. studies, urged his government to relax border controls to allow educators, students and scholars to enter Japan and pursue their academic activity. Many of them have been forced to give up Japan studies and focus instead on other countries, including South Korea. âThey become the bridges between Japan and other societies. They are future policymakers, business leaders, and teachers. They are the foundation of the U.S.-Japan alliance and other international relationships that support Japanâs core national interests,ï¿½?the letter said. âThe closure is harming Japanâs national interests and international relationships.ï¿½?Japan recently announced it will allow 87 students on Japanese government scholarships to enter the country, but petitioners say there are many others on foreign government-sponsored scholarships who still cannot get in. Tokyo logged 8,638 new cases of coronavirus infection Thursday, exceeding the previous record of 7,377 set the day before. At a Tokyo metropolitan government task force meeting, experts sounded the alarm at the fast-paced upsurge led by omicron. Norio Ohmagari, Director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center of National Center for Global Health and an advisor to the Tokyo metropolitan government panel, said Tokyoâs daily new cases may exceed 18,000 within a week if the increase continues at the current pace. Though only some of the soaring number of infected people are hospitalized and occupying less than one-third of available hospital beds in the Japanese capital, experts say the rapid upsurge of the cases could quickly overwhelm the medical systems once the infections further spread among the elderly population who are more likely to become seriously ill. Surging infections have begun to paralyze hospitals, schools and other sectors in some areas. The ministry has trimmed the required self-isolation period from 14 days to 10 for those who come into close contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19, and to seven days for essential workers if they test negative. While about 80% of Japanese have received their first two vaccine doses, the rollout of booster shots has been slow and has reached only 1.4 % of the population so far."

The hand-pulled noodle lesson, billed by Irene as a master class, focuses on both biang biang (long and broad) and lo mein (spaghetti-shaped). There's rigorous kneading involved, so plan to work up a sweat. Making dumplings or noodles takes practice and patience, says Irene. âAnd even if you make ugly dumplingsï¿½?she adds, âdon't worry, because it's what's on the inside that counts. There are life lessons to be learned in making dumplings.ï¿½?The next dumpling class via Zoom ($33) will be held on March 12 from noon to 1:30 p.m., and the hand-pulled noodle master class ($45) is March 11 from 6:30 to 8 p.m. Mei Mei's private classes cost $525 (dumplings) and $750 (hand-pulled noodles), both for groups of up to 12.

774,0,"Cyberattack on News Corp, Believed Linked to China, Targeted Emails of Journalists, Others--4th Update",803 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"News Corp said it notified law enforcement and hired cybersecurity firm Mandiant Inc. to support an investigation. A representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation said late Friday that it was aware of the incident. ""Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests,"" said David Wong, vice president of incident response at Mandiant.  News Corp disclosed the hack in a securities filing Friday, saying its preliminary analysis indicates that data was taken. A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said that China is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and ""firmly opposes and combats cyberattacks and cyber theft in all forms."" The spokesman, Liu Pengyu, said that identifying the source of cyberattacks is technically complex. ""We hope that there can be a professional, responsible and evidence-based approach to identifying cyber-related incidents, rather than making allegations based on speculations,"" Mr. Liu said. In the staff memo News Corp said it believes the threat activity is contained. The company has been offering guidance to affected employees. ""We are committed to protecting our journalists and sources. We will not be deterred from our purpose -- to provide uniquely trusted journalism and analysis. We will continue to publish the important stories of our time,"" said Almar Latour, chief executive of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal. The company's investigation indicates that systems housing financial and customer data, including subscriber information, weren't affected, according to the securities filing and a person familiar with the matter. The investigation detected that the intrusion appeared to date to at least February 2020, according to people briefed on the matter, and scores of employees were impacted. The hackers were able to access reporters' emails and Google Docs, including drafts of articles, the people said. The company was still trying to determine which emails and documents were accessed, the people said. Reporters who were affected by the hack and were briefed on it expressed concerns to company officials about protecting their sources' identities. Law-enforcement officials and cybersecurity experts say that journalists are often high-priority targets for hackers seeking to gain intelligence on behalf of foreign governments, because they speak to sources who might have valuable or sensitive information. Powerful surveillance tools have been used against journalists and human-rights activists. U.S. authorities have accused China-based hackers for years of targeting a range of American businesses and government institutions. FBI Director Christopher Wray said this week that Beijing is running a ""massive, sophisticated hacking program that is bigger than those of every other major nation combined."" The FBI has more than 2,000 active investigations related to allegations of Chinese-government-directed theft of U.S. information or technology, Mr. Wray said. China has repeatedly denied allegations that it has carried out cyberattacks. In 2013, Chinese hackers trying to monitor news coverage of China hacked into the Journal's network, apparently aiming to spy on reporters covering China and other issues, the Journal reported. The New York Times had experienced a similar attack. At the time, a Chinese embassy spokesman condemned allegations of Chinese cyberspying and said Beijing prohibits cyberattacks. In February 2020, China revoked the press credentials of three Journal reporters based in Beijing. China's Foreign Ministry said the move was punishment for an opinion piece published by the Journal. The three journalists work for the Journal's news operation, which operates with a strict separation from the opinion staff. The following month, the Trump administration announced a personnel cap in the U.S. on four state-run Chinese media outlets. Later that March, China expelled from the country American journalists from multiple news organizations, including the Journal. In November 2021, each country agreed to ease visa restrictions for the other's reporters. The Journal was among a handful of U.S. outlets set to receive new press credentials for some staff.

Gunaraja, who runs an eatery on Ormes Road in Kilpauk. He complained that the police forced him to close his business by 10.30 p.m., fearing a law and order problem could be created by anti-social elements. Disapproving of the policeâs insistence, the judge wrote: âItâs a shame and highly deplorable that the police instead of taking stringent action against anti-social elements are insisting upon the petitioner to close his eatery by 10.30 p.m.ï¿½?While doing so, the police are infringing upon the Constitutional right of the owners to carry on their business as per the law and also the fundamental right of the consumers to eat food, a part and parcel of the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution, he added. The police could not force eateries to shut down simply because they apprehend a law and order problem, he said."
657,0,War via TikTok: Russia's new tool for propaganda machine,1195 words,Associated Press Newswires,"Armies of trolls and bots stir up anti-Ukrainian sentiment. State-controlled media outlets look to divide Western audiences. Clever TikTok videos serve up Russian nationalism with a side of humor. The effort amounts to an emerging part of Russia's war arsenal with the shaping of opinion through orchestrated disinformation [https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-technology-europe-media-social-media-123c7975a879b89b85c06877f1f12908] fighting alongside actual troops and weapons. In the cat video, a husky puppy identified by a digitally inserted U.S. flag swipes at the tail of a tabby identified by a Russian flag. The cat responds with a ferocious jab that sends the hapless dog scurrying. The clip, which has been viewed 775,000 times in two weeks, is the work of an account named Funrussianprezident that boasts 310,000 followers. Almost all of its videos feature pro-Russian content. âIt could just be a patriotic Russian fighting the good fight as they see it, or it could easily be something directly affiliated with the state,ï¿½?said Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation researcher and expert on Eastern Europe at the Wilson Center in Washington. âRussia has been perfecting these tactics.ï¿½?Now they are putting them in play. Analysts at several different research organizations contacted by The Associated Press said they are seeing a sharp increase in online activity by groups affiliated with the Russian state. That's in keeping with Russia's strategy of using social media and state-run outlets to galvanize domestic support while seeking to destabilize the Western alliance. Across the internet, there's been a rapid uptick in suspicious accounts spreading anti-Ukrainian content, according to a report from Cyabra, an Israeli tech company that works to detect disinformation. Cyabra's analysts tracked thousands of Facebook and Twitter accounts that had recently posted about Ukraine. They saw a sudden and dramatic increase in anti-Ukrainian content in the days immediately before the invasion. On Valentine's Day, for instance, the number of anti-Ukrainian posts created by the sample of Twitter accounts jumped by 11,000% when compared with just days earlier. Analysts believe a significant portion of the accounts are inauthentic and controlled by groups linked to the Russian government. âWhen you see an 11,000% increase, you know something is going on,ï¿½?said Cyabra CEO Dan Brahmy. âNo one can know who is doing this behind the scenes. We can only guess.ï¿½?The work has been underway for some time. Researchers at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab analyzed 3,000 articles by 10 state-owned Russian news outlets and noticed a big increase in unfounded claims that Ukraine was poised to strike separatist groups. Overall, Russian media claims of Ukrainian aggression surged by 50% in January, according to the research. âThis is the way they go to war; it's a central part of Russian doctrine,ï¿½?said Jim Ludes, a former U.S. defense analyst who now directs the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University. Ludes said Russian disinformation campaigns are intended to galvanize Russian support while confusing and dividing the countryâs opponents. Russia tailors its propaganda message for specific audiences. For Russians and pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, the message is that Russia is trying to defend its own people against Western-fueled aggression and persecution in Ukraine. Similar tactics have been used, including by Nazi Germany when it invaded Czechoslovakia under the guise of protecting ethnic Germans living there, Ludes noted. âItâs not good guys who use this tactic,ï¿½?Ludes said. âItâs the language of conquest, not the language of democracy.ï¿½?Russia is also using disinformation to confound and demoralize its opponents. For instance, the Kremlin said it resumed fighting Saturday after pausing for possible talks with Ukraine. But AP journalists in various areas of Ukraine witnessed that the Russian offensive never stopped. The chaotic information environment surrounding the invasion led to confusing and sometimes contradictory accounts. On Friday Ukrainian officials reported that all troops stationed on the strategic Snake Island had been killed after defiantly refusing Russian demands to surrender. Russian state TV later showed what it claimed was footage of the soldiers alive in custody. The AP was unable to immediately verify either claim. Meanwhile, the U.S. has information indicating Russia is publicizing false reports about widespread surrenders of Ukrainian troops and claims that Moscow plans to âthreaten killing family members of Ukrainian soldiers if they do not surrender,ï¿½?according to State Department spokesman Ned Price. Russia has also employed cyberattacks [https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-technology-business-europe-russia-9e9f9e9b52eaf53cf9d8ade0588b661b] in its invasion of Ukraine, and while they pose a serious threat, online propaganda can leave even more lasting damage if it succeeds, according to retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Nagata, a former director of strategic operational planning at the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center. âWhat is far more dangerous is Russiaâs ability to influence what populations everywhere believe,ï¿½?Nagata said. âTo get them to believe things that are useful for Russian strategic interests... If youâre able to change what an entire population believes, you may not have to attack anything.ï¿½?In the West, Russia seeks to sow division and reduce the chances of a unified international response. It does this in part through a stable of state-controlled media outlets such as Sputnik and RT, which publish in English, Spanish and several other languages. âThe invasion is off,ï¿½?read one headline in RT last week, just days before Russian troops moved into eastern Ukraine. âTucker Carlson Slams Biden for Focusing on Putin, Ukraine Instead of US Domestic Problems,ï¿½?reads another in Sputnik News, reflecting a common Russian practice: cite government critics in the U.S. (like Fox News host Carlson) to suggest America's leaders are out of touch. The European Union signaled its concerns about RT on Wednesday when it included [https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-vladimir-putin-europe-european-union-bad785095c4dcd5aeeb34f5db494b471] RT's editor-in-chief on a list of sanctions imposed on Russian officials. The EU called RT's leader, Margarita Simonyan âa central figure of the government propaganda.ï¿½?On Friday, Facebook announced that it would prohibit RT from running ads on its site and said it would expand its use of labels to identify state-run media. Ludes said heâs been pleased to see the U.S and its allies forcefully push back [https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-russia-media-vladimir-putin-ecba20c81181c028b06109cf8620426a] on Russian disinformation and even seek to preempt it by publicly disclosing Russiaâs plans. âThe Biden administration has demonstrated some creativity in using intelligence to respond,ï¿½?he said. âWe havenât seen that from the West since the cold war days.ï¿½?___ Associated Press writers Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow and Matthew Lee and Nathan Ellgren in Washington contributed to this report."

Mr. Meyer said the idea for the unusual reboot was born on Manhattaâs last night of service in March 2020, when the bar was five deep with locals even as the pandemic loomed.

510,0,Forget working from home -- why not live in an old office?,717 words,Agence France Presse,"""The market spoke, and it said the value was greater for a conversion than for it continuing as office space,"" said Michael Abrams, managing director of Foulger-Pratt, the property development firm that is turning the 14-story building on New York Avenue into 255 apartments. A survey by apartment listing service RentCafe found about 20,100 apartments were built out of converted properties in the United States last year, almost double the number converted in the year prior. Such conversions could offer a way forward for US downtowns, which haven't been the same since office workers fled as Covid-19 broke out nearly two years ago, leaving landlords and local businesses struggling. ""The slow office market recovery is just going to make it that much more expensive to carry vacant office buildings,"" Abrams said. Conversions may also play a role in easing a shortage of affordable housing, particularly in cities like Washington, where notoriously high rents are a feature of life. ""From the overall perspective, we just need increased supply. By having more supply, both the home price growth will come down and the rents will come down,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors. Despite the downturn caused by Covid-19, the median price of existing homes climbed 15.8 percent over the course of 2021, and by last month supply had hit an all-time low, according to NAR data, likely exacerbating a crisis of affordable housing that predated the pandemic. As of 2017, 48 percent of tenants were considered ""rent burdened"" by the US Government Accountability Office -- meaning they paid more than 30 percent of their income on rent -- a figure that had risen six percentage points over the preceding 16 years. The United States meanwhile has a glut of offices. With many of them dating to the 1980s, they are now too old to be attractive to companies, said Tracy Hadden Loh, a fellow at Brookings Metro. With their designs centered around outdated needs like space for file cabinets, ""Really just the entire building is obsolete,"" she said in an interview. Marc Ehrlich, chief investment officer at Rose Associates, which has converted New York City offices into housing, said such projects tend to be ""well-located properties that need a higher and better use."" One of his firm's latest undertakings is the transformation of an office once used by telecommunications firm AT&T into a place people want to live. Lacking amenities like covered parking, the building is unlikely to attract commercial tenants, Ehrlich said. However, the new apartments will feature co-working spaces, since many tenants will likely want to continue working from home, he said. In Washington, developers are pouncing on properties formerly rented by the region's top employer, the federal government. This includes The Wray, an office building used by the State Department, but which has been totally renovated to house apartments. The only signs of its former use are in the lobby, where the tiles are original, as is a directory listing the names of State Department offices once based there. ""The pool of tenants that goes back into these buildings is dramatically diminished, and that's what's putting the stress on that tier of property, that's what's creating the opportunity,"" said Abrams. Adaptive reuse projects tend to demand high rents, Loh said, since they often require expensive renovations such as the construction of new bathrooms in buildings where they were once communal. While expanding inventory has been shown to relieve price pressures elsewhere in the housing market, ""This isn't a solution to the housing crisis,"" she added. ""This is a solution to revitalize areas like downtowns that are super dominated by places like office spaces."" cs/bbk"
447,0,"Quebec restaurants are reopening, but some former workers don't plan to go back",959 words,The Canadian Press,"With dining rooms closed and no tourists in the city, there was little work to go around. ""Everybody was fighting to find even part-time jobs,"" he said in a recent interview. Danielou, who now does data entry, said his new job is less interesting, but the $30-an-hour pay is better, and he's not worried about losing his job if the COVID-19 situation worsens. ""Nothing compares to restaurant work, the rush, the drive, the energy, the team, the people you meet. Nothing compares to that,"" he said. But it's not enough to draw him back. ""You have to pay your rent, you have to survive."" Quebec restaurant dining rooms were ordered closed starting Dec. 31 as the number of COVID-19 cases in the province shot up. Under the new rules, restaurants will be able to open Monday at 50 per cent capacity and there will be limits on how many people from different households can share a table. Liam Thomas, 32, said that while he decided to leave the industry last summer,when restaurants were open, it wasn't a choice he would have made if he hadn't already lived through two lockdowns. ""I was being yelled at for the millionth time in my cooking career and I just walked out and I never went back,"" Thomas, a former line cook, said in a recent interview. ""It was precipitated by the lockdowns and the knowledge that could happen again, and the instability of the work."" Thomas, who said he started working in restaurants at 18, now works as a transport attendant at a Montreal hospital, helping patients get to X-rays and other appointments within the hospital. While Thomas said he still sometimes misses the rush of the kitchen, his new job is less stressful, better paid and offers more vacation time. ""The issues that the pandemic exposed were always there for restaurant workers,"" said Kaitlin Doucette of the Canadian Restaurant Workers Coalition, a group that advocates for better working conditions in the industry. She said workers have long lacked health benefits and paid sick days, and that the precarious nature of work in the industry can lead to abuse and sexual harassment. One of the biggest challenges of the latest closure in Quebec, Doucette said in a recent interview, is that workers were only eligible for $300 a week in federal aid. Montrealer MichÃ¨le Martel, who worked in bars for 25 years, said she started looking for a new job because that wasn't enough to live on. ""I had no choice. With the amount of money they're giving us, my savings would have disappeared for a third time. It's hard to save money, and when the closings come, the money melts away,"" she said. ""And it's not just financial, I also need to work for my morale, to see people."" When bars and restaurants reopened for the second time in June 2021, Martel said she was confident it would last ï¿½?most Quebecers were vaccinated and businesses had been following public health orders. But this third closure has left her afraid that it could happen again. While Martel said she plans to look for a job as a bartender, she also intends to keep working at her new job, in a senior's residence, part-time. Martin Juneau, the owner of Pastaga, a restaurant in Montreal's Little Italy neighbourhood, said he's worried about finding staff for a reopening that he said feels more like opening for the first time. ""We had a lot of employees who finally moved on to something else, who wanted to go in a different direction, in a different industry,"" he said in a recent interview. While Juneau said he closed his dining room before he was ordered to by the provincial government, he's worried that he'll have to do it again. âWeâre afraid for next fall, and weâre afraid of not having the energy to get to next fall,"" he said. He was forced to close some other businesses, including a restaurant and wine shop, a corner grocery and an ice cream shop, early in the pandemic, and he said they won't be coming back. ""We're exactly the opposite of expanding,"" Juneau said. Benoit Dessureault, the owner of Chez Delmo in Old Montreal, said he was able to keep paying longtime employees with the help of a food truck. While some of his workers did get laid off, he said he found projects to hire them to work on during the closures. Still, he said the reopening means the restaurant ï¿½?which had attracted a lunchtime crowd of lawyers and businesspeople ï¿½?now plans to focus more on dinner. ""The office towers are still empty, so we can't keep the same business proposition as we had before,"" Dessureault said in an interview. Dessureault said he hopes that customers will be more patient ï¿½?and understanding ï¿½?when they return to restaurants that still face strict public health rules.

Production capacity will be phased throughout 2022 and is expected to add an additional $200 million in capacity by the end of the year. At full capacity, Bolingbrook is expected to support approximately $250 to $300 million in net sales. Located only 30 miles outside of Chicago, Bolingbrook is an ideal location for the Company's second manufacturing facility because of the proximity to raw materials and distribution hubs. The highly automated facility is expected to reduce the Company's overall cost structure, increase margins, and accelerate profitability. ""As we continue to work to increase capacity to meet demand for our products, Bolingbrook represents the next step in our growth journey,"" said Gerard Law, Chief Executive Officer of Real Good Foods. ""Opening the Bolingbrook facility within six months of signing the lease demonstrates the speed, agility, and experience of our organization.

ESG Awards: We have obtained 25 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (""LEEDÂ®"") certifications, including one LEEDÂ® Silver certification, and various ENERGY STARÂ® certifications. Our Gateway Commerce Park property recently received recognition by the Building Owners and Managers Association of Miami-Dade for The Outstanding Building of the Year Award in the industrial office park category. Property Development: The development and value-add program has produced tremendous value for our shareholders; we have developed approximately 49% of our properties (on a square foot basis). While formal certification is not always pursued, the Company builds all of its development properties with the intention of meeting LEEDÂ® certifiable standards. In 2021, the Company amended and restated its unsecured credit facilities, providing for an incremental reduction in borrowing costs if a certain sustainability-linked metric, measured annually, is achieved. This metric is based on a target number of newly-constructed buildings with qualifying electric vehicle charging stations as a percentage of total qualifying buildings and allows for the reduction of the applicable interest margin by one basis point. SOCIAL INITIATIVES Flexible Work Environment: EastGroup continues to offer its employees a flexible work environment that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. Workforce Diversity: Our current employee base is 77% comprised of women. The officer group is comprised of 42% women and 58% men, and 19% of our employees identify as racial or ethnic minorities. Our Board of Directors is 22% comprised of women, and in 2022, we added one director who self identifies as a racial minority. With 86 employees and 9 directors, each team member plays a vital role in the success of the Company. CURRENT EMPLOYEE BASE CURRENT OFFICER GROUP Employee Tenure: The average tenure of our workforce is 10 years, and 13 years for our officers. Compensation, Benefits, Health and Safety: EastGroup offers a comprehensive employee benefits program and what we believe are socially-responsible policies and practices in order to support the overall well-being of our employees and create a safe, professional and inclusive work environment. During 2021, we adopted a parental leave policy, human rights statement and vendor code of conduct. Training and Development: Our employees are provided with training, education and peer mentoring programs to further develop their professional skill set, enhancing the level of customer service provided to our customers and the quality of information disclosed to our stakeholders. In 2020, the Company implemented a formal, certificate-based learning program for all employees, which continued throughout 2021. 2022 PROXY STATEMENT 3 2021 Performance Highlights CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Company and Board Engagement: We value our employees, and our focus on human capital management and other socially-responsible initiatives is at the forefront of discussions and decisions with both management and the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has responsibility for oversight of the Company's ESG program, and the Audit Committee has responsibility for oversight of the Company's accounting, financial reporting, cybersecurity and other information technology risks. Committees report to the full Board of Directors. ESG Executive Officer Individual Goals: Beginning in 2021, individual compensation goals (which account for 20% of performance in connection with our annual incentive plan) include ESG-related goals for our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer.

Loeb, our CEO Skills and Experience 6 Proxy Voting Roadmap Corporate Governance Highlights What We Do All Board members are elected annually by shareholders (non-staggered board). Seven of the nine Board members nominated for election are independent. Two of the nine Board members nominated for election are women, and one director identifies as a racial or ethnic minority. The positions of Chairman and CEO are separated. All stock-based incentive plans have been approved by shareholders. The Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are all comprised entirely of independent directors. During 2020, the Board rotated the Chairpersons of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Audit Committee meets with independent and internal auditors at least quarterly. Management holds ESG-related discussions with the Board of Directors on a regular basis; in 2021, our management and the Board of Directors formally met to discuss these topics three times. The Board formally delegated oversight of the Company's ESG strategy and policies to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in March 2022, with ongoing oversight by the full Board. Interested parties may communicate directly with the Board through a link on the Company's website. During 2020, the Board eliminated director meeting fees by adopting a retainer compensation program for directors. Over the past three years, the shares granted to employees and directors have been less than 1% of the shares outstanding. Compensation is strongly tied to performance, and we do not have employment agreements, automatic salary increases or guaranteed bonuses. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was less than 5% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Board has adopted a clawback policy that applies to both cash and equity incentive compensation. The Board has adopted robust stock ownership guidelines for directors and executive officers. Full Board oversight of risk management. What We Don't Do No collective bargaining agreements. No hedging or pledging of Company securities by directors or executive officers. No excessive perquisites. No supplemental executive retirement plans. No tax gross-ups and generally no single-trigger provisions. See pages 28-30 for more details.

Non-Binding, Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation Proposal3  THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR PROPOSAL 3.  Executive Compensation Snapshot Pay Elements CEO Other NEOs Why It Is Provided Key Features We pay a base level of competitive cash salary to attract and retain executive talent. We determine base salary based on experience, job scope, market data and individual performance. We annually review our Named Executive Officers' base salaries against our peers to maintain competitive levels. Our annual cash and equity incentives are based on the achievement of objective at-risk Company performance metrics to align compensation with strategic goals. Our performance metrics (funds from operations (""FFO"") per share, same property net operating income (""PNOI"") change, debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate (""EBITDAre"") ratio and fixed charge coverage) are commonly used measures of REIT performance. A portion of the annual incentive is based on the achievement of individual performance goals to reward individual initiative, achievements and contributions. We grant performance-based and service-based restricted shares to our executives. Performance-based awards are only earned by achieving the Company's three-year total shareholder return (""TSR"") performance hurdles relative to the Nareit Equity Index and member companies of the Nareit Industrial Index. This is a critical component of aligning executive compensation with shareholders' interests. Service-based awards encourage executive retention by vesting ratably over four years.

401,1,Delhi water output to be amped up to around 1k million gallons per day this year,718 words,Hindustan Times,"""The targeted production from the nine water treatment plants will be pushed up to 861MGD instead of last year's peak summer production of 845 MGD. The extraction of water from sub-surface resources, such as ranney wells and tubewells, will be 137MGD -- an addition of 47 MGD over last year,"" said a senior DJB official. A senior DJB official said that the number of operational tubewells will be raised to 5,263 -- an increase of 471 -- to meet the increased target, adding that the water will be sustainably extracted from areas having high ground water level and located along the Yamuna floodplains or water treatment plants with high natural recharge. The groundwater contribution to Delhi's water supply was 86 MGD in 2020 and 90 MGD in 2021. According to the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB), water in most parts of Delhi is already in the ""overexploited"" category, meaning there is more extraction than there is recharge. Its latest annual report for 2020-21, released in August 2021, claims that large parts of groundwater in Delhi was also found to have high salinity levels and had the presence of heavy metals such as iron, manganese and even uranium beyond the permissible limits. The economic survey released by the Delhi government on March 25, 2022 states that the water treatment capacity of the DJB, which had remained largely stagnant at 906MGD between 2014 to 2018, has witnessed growth over the last three years with the largest spike over the last one year. ""The water production is also being gradually raised by reducing water leakage losses, increasing the performance levels of water treatment plant by replacing filters, old pumps and also shoring up the sub-surface water resources,"" said the official. The DJB operates nine water treatment plants in the city at Wazirabad, Chandrawal, Haiderpur, Nangloi, Okhla, Dwarka, Bawana, Bhagirathi and Sonia Vihar. ""The optimisation has led to increase of production by 5MGD each in Chandrawal and Haiderpur water treatment plants while the other units will increase output by 1-2 MGD,"" said the official. The latest outcome budget of the DJB states that the water utility has been able to save 4MGD of water due to repair of 2,955km of old and defective pipelines till December 2021. While the piped water supply has been extended to 1,642 unauthorised colonies, the water utility has also identified 10,141 daily fixed water supply points where tankers will be deployed. ""Between April and July 2022 period, 1,198 water tanker will remain on duty. DJB has 250 stainless steel water tankers, 407 units have been contracted and another 541 have been hired for summer action plan... The vulnerable points have been identified in consultation with the local MLAs,"" the official explained. Manoj Misra, who heads Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, said that such water extraction points can be developed in the active floodplain areas where natural recharge can occur but the water utility should not extend it to the non-floodplain zones. ""The concern mainly is regarding the quality of water and there should be constant monitoring of the contaminants in the water being extracted. In Sonia Vihar or Palla floodplains, chances of contamination are low but the DJB should still monitor the level of insecticide contamination due to agricultural activities on floodplains,"" he added.

945,0,âDiabolicï¿½?problems kneecap tourism,589 words,The Australian - Online,"Industry leaders are pleading with state and federal governments to stitch together an emergency funding package to rescue operators running on skeleton staff. On Daydream Island in Queenslandâs Whitsundays, chief operating officer Dilip Madhok has been phoning guests all week to cancel bookings because there is not enough staff to service the resort âbut they are still turning up anywayï¿½? âWe had to close two of our three restaurants because the chefs were all down. If they go for a test, they are away for five days at least waiting for a result,ï¿½?he said. âThe demand is definitely there and as a business person it is painful to see the opportunity but not be able to manage it. We need emergency relief.ï¿½?Even before the surge in Covid-19 infections put large chunks of the workforce into isolation, Daydream Island was trying to recruit an extra 60 staff, including 14 chefs. A lack of rapid antigen tests is making the situation worse because staff need to travel to the mainland for a PCR swab, leaving the remaining workforce under pressure to meet guestsï¿½?demands. âWe have had some very nasty, abusive people, making the waitresses cry,ï¿½?Mr Madhok said. âA lot of people are leaving because of the way they are treated by customers. Why would they want to go to work and get screamed at?ï¿½?Julie Telford, who owns Whitsundays charter boat company Red Cat Adventures, said she had already suffered a staff loss when vaccine mandates were enforced on businesses in December. âThe major concerns we have here are staff and accommodation shortÂ­ages which are being made a lot worse by testing issues and isolation of people who are not Covid-positive,ï¿½?she said. âLuckily for us, we got a lot of rapid tests a long time ago because the wait for a PCR test here is five days.ï¿½?Ms Telford was part of a group of Whitsundays tourism operators who met Anthony Albanese in Airlie Beach on Tuesday morning. The Labor leader said RAT access issues had created a âdiabolic situationï¿½?for Queenslandâs tourism industry and was exacerbating worker shortages. âWhat I want is for Scott Morrison to do his job,ï¿½?Mr Albanese said. âIf he had done his job, then we would have had rapid antigen tests available.ï¿½?Queensland Tourism Industry chief Daniel Gschwind said the failure of governments to provide RATs was âreally disappointingï¿½? âSurely it was somewhat predictable that the demand would escalate,ï¿½?he said. âGovernment must seriously consider cash support for businesses which have been pushed to the brink ï¿½?it is more dire than ever before. âMany restaurants are closed or operating at reduced capacity and accommodation providers are shutting down parts of hotels because they cannot meet demand.ï¿½?Mr Gschwind said funding would help alleviate financial strain until working holiday visa holders could return to Queensland without needing to quarantine, expected by monthâs end. Australians who test positive to Covid-19 or are isolating because they are a close contact can access a $750 lump sum payment for seven days under the Morrison governmentâs Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment."

And now those avenues have all been closed off. And so Russia's having McDonald's exit that market really brings a bookend or close to that era. And we're kind of standing in, symbolically at least, a new era of division between Russia and much of the rest of the world,"" said Paul Musgrave, assistant professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst . McDonald's said it would continue to pay salaries to its 62,000 employees in Russia. Because of its large size and global reach, the chain is often copied by other companies if it takes a stance on an issue or makes a major operational change. "" I think there is going to be a little bit of a noticeable hit to McDonald's bottom line. In their 2020 annual report, they had $500 million of assets denominated in rubles that they had to look out for. International business accounts for more than half of McDonald's corporate revenue. Russia is a smaller part of that, but it is a real part of it. So there is a real hit, "" Musgrave said.  Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc also said on Tuesday they are suspending sales of their sodas in Russia. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""

Investors with Losses to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - CABA",753 words,Media OutReach Newswire,"WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Cabaletta class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=3749[https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/Xn580uNary] or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com[mailto:pkim@rosenlegal.com] or cases@rosenlegal.com[mailto:cases@rosenlegal.com] for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 29, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, the IPO offering documents and defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) top-line data of the Phase 1 Clinical Trial indicated that DSG3-CAART had, among other things, worsened certain participants' disease activity scores and necessitated additional systemic medication to improve disease activity after DSG3-CAART infusion; (2) accordingly, DSG3-CAART was not as effective as the Company had represented to investors; (3) therefore, the Company had overstated DSG3-CAART's clinical and/or commercial prospects; and (4) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

881,1,Press Release: BurgerFi Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Results,5434 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"Revenue Grows 103% in 2021; Systemwide same store sales increase 14% and New Unit Growth of 13% Conference Call today, April 14, at 8:30 a.m. ET FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., April 14, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BurgerFi International, Inc. (Nasdaq: BFI, BFIIW) (""BurgerFi"" or the ""Company""), owner of one of the nation's leading fast-casual ""better burger"" dining concepts through the BurgerFi brand, and the high-quality, casual dining pizza brand under the name Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza & Wings (""Anthony's""), today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2021. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Key Metrics(1) Summary BurgerFi Brand Only Three Months Twelve Months Ended Ended (in thousands, except for percentage December 31, December 31, data) 2021 2021 --------------- ----------------- Systemwide Restaurant Sales $ 40,701 $ 166,121 Systemwide Restaurant Sales Growth 23% 31% Systemwide Restaurant Same Store Sales Growth 7% 14% Corporate Restaurant Sales $ 8,736 $ 33,435 Corporate Restaurant Sales Growth 33% 39% Corporate Restaurant Same Store Sales Growth 5% 14% Franchise Restaurant Sales $ 31,737 $ 127,165 Franchise Restaurant Sales Growth 22% 30% Franchise Restaurant Same Store Sales Growth 7% 15% Digital Channel Orders Growth (4)% 18% Digital Channel Orders 550 2,482 Digital Channel Orders % of Systemwide Sales 36% 39% 1. Refer to ""Key Metrics Definitions"" and ""About Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" sections below. Management Commentary  Ophir Sternberg, Executive Chairman of BurgerFi, stated, ""2021 was a fantastic year of growth and transformation at BurgerFi despite the many industry-wide effects of COVID-19. We were able to lay the foundation for significant growth through opening 16 BurgerFi restaurants and through the acquisition of Anthony's in November. I have the utmost confidence in our strengthened management team to execute on our business initiatives, maximize the potential of our two great restaurant brands, and deliver value to our shareholders as we head into 2022.""  Ian Baines, Chief Executive Officer of BurgerFi, added, ""The fourth quarter capped off a year of significant growth for BurgerFi. In the quarter, we initiated the integration of Anthony's into the BurgerFi system. The BurgerFi brand also performed strongly with a 23% growth in systemwide sales, driven primarily through new store openings and a 7% increase in same store sales. Of note, we retained nearly all of our digital channel sales when compared to peak COVID-19 levels, which is very encouraging. In 2022, we expect to realize $2 million in our first wave of cost synergies from the BurgerFi and Anthony's combination, with additional opportunity for 2023. We plan to expand access and convenience for our guests through continued investments in technological advancements, innovation and our digital ecosystem, accompanied by the 15 to 20 expected new BurgerFi brand restaurant openings we have planned for 2022. This unit growth and enhanced omni-channel customer experience, combined with the incredible food we offer should provide the foundation for an outstanding 2022."" Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results Total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased 261% to $35.1 million compared to $9.7 million in the year-ago quarter, driven by the addition of two months of operations of the Anthony's business acquired on November 3, 2021, additional revenue from new restaurants opened during the period and an increase in royalty and other fees. Systemwide sales in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased 23% to $40.7 million compared to $33.2 million in the prior year period. Same store sales increased 5% and 7% in corporate-owned and franchised locations, respectively, and were supported by an increase in average check, resulting from the strong performance of new menu items such as the SWAG burger (Spicy Wagyu burger) and price increases instituted towards the end of the second quarter. Restaurant-level operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $27.5 million compared to $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, which includes two months of operations of the Anthony's business, which was acquired on November 3, 2021. Restaurant-level operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 340 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher labor costs. Net loss attributable to common shareholders in the fourth quarter was $117.3 million compared to a net income attributable to common shareholders and controlling interests of $6.0 million in the year-ago quarter. The loss resulted primarily from $114.8 million of non-cash impairment charges, and $2.1 million of acquisition-related costs and certain investments made after becoming a public company in December of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased 231% to $2.6 million compared to $0.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by the acquisition of Anthony's and BurgerFi's revenue growth, partially offset by the investments made related to being a public company and those to drive the growth and development of corporate-owned restaurants. See the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, and the reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP measures below. Full Year 2021 Financial Results Total revenue in 2021 increased 103% to $68.9 million compared to $34.0 million in 2020, driven by the addition of two months of operations of the Anthony's business acquired on November 3, 2021, the addition of new restaurants opened during the period, and an increase in royalties and other fees. Systemwide sales in 2021 rose 31% to $166.1 million compared to $126.9 million in 2020. Same store sales increased 14% and 15% in corporate-owned and franchised locations, respectively, and were supported by an increase in average check value, resulting from menu innovation at the end of the first quarter and price increases instituted towards the end of the second quarter. Restaurant-level operating expenses for 2021 were $50.4 million compared to $22.1 million in the prior year period. Restaurant-level operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, improved for the full year 2021 by 110 basis points, compared to the full year of 2020, due to a change in our sales mix, more efficiently managing our costs of delivery through third party suppliers, reduced other store operating expenses, and leverage on occupancy costs, that are relatively fixed in nature. Net loss attributable to common shareholders in 2021 was $121.5 million compared to a net income attributable to common shareholders and controlling interests of $6.0 million in 2020. The loss resulted primarily from $114.8 million non-cash impairment charges, $7.6 million of non-cash share-based compensation expenses, $4.3 million of acquisition-related costs, $1.9 million of pre-opening costs and certain investments related to becoming a public company in December 2020. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 72% in 2021, from $2.2 million in the prior year to $3.8 million in 2021. This growth was driven by the addition of two months of operations of the Anthony's business acquired on November 3, 2021, revenue growth from new restaurants and a 14% increase in systemwide same store sales, partially offset by the investments related to being a public company and investments associated with the resources to support accelerated corporate-owned restaurant development. See the reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP measures below. Liquidity On December 31, 2021, the Company had $14.9 million in cash, compared to $37.2 million on December 31, 2020. BurgerFi repaid and then terminated its $3.0 million revolving credit line in the first quarter of 2021, repaid $9.2 million of debt acquired in the acquisition of Anthony's and invested $10.7 million in capital expenditures in 2021. 2022 Outlook The Company acknowledges the challenges many in the industry are facing, including shortages of materials and labor for construction and development, along with elevated economic uncertainty. With that, management is reiterating the following expectations for the full year 2022 assuming the current economic environment does not change materially: -- Annual revenues of $180-190 million. -- Mid-single digit same-store sales growth. -- 15-20 new BurgerFi brand restaurant openings, most of which will be franchised locations. -- Adjusted EBITDA of $12-14 million. -- Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $4 million.

Key Metrics Definitions The following definitions apply to the terms listed below: ""Systemwide Restaurant Sales"" is presented as informational data in order to understand the aggregation of franchised stores sales, ghost kitchen and corporate-owned stores sales performance. Systemwide restaurant sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants, ghost kitchens and corporate-owned restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Systemwide restaurant same store sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants, ghost kitchens, and corporate-owned restaurants once the restaurant has been in operation after 14 months. See definition below for same store sales. ""Corporate-Owned Restaurant Sales"" represent the sales generated only by corporate-owned restaurants that are open for the full year. Corporate-owned restaurant sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all corporate-owned restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Corporate-owned restaurant same store sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all corporate-owned restaurants once the restaurant has been in operation after 14 months. These measures highlight the performance of existing corporate-owned restaurants. ""Franchise Restaurant Sales"" represent the sales generated only by franchisee-owned restaurants that are open for the full year. Franchise restaurant sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Franchise restaurant same store sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants once the restaurant has been in operation after 14 months. These measures highlight the performance of existing franchised restaurants. ""Same Store Sales"" is used to evaluate the performance of our store base, which excludes the impact of new stores and closed stores, in both periods under comparison. We include a restaurant in the calculation of same store sales once it has been in operation after 14 months. A restaurant which is temporarily closed (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), is included in the same store sales computation. A restaurant which is closed permanently, such as upon termination of the lease, or other permanent closure, is immediately removed from the same store sales computation. Our calculation of same store sales may not be comparable to others in the industry. ""Digital Channel Orders"" is used to measure performance of our investments made in our digital platform and partnerships with third party delivery partners.

774,1,Dropped Catch: Why Wesfarmers' online marketplace is struggling,848 words,The Sydney Morning Herald - Online,"Three years and one pandemic later, Catch's growth story is looking more like a saga. Since its purchase, the business reported an inaugural full-year profit of just $1 million in 2020, before posting a $46 million loss in 2021 and a $44 million loss in the first half of fiscal 2022. And though the business' revenue started strong, in the last half it fell by 4.3 per cent. Last week, Wesfarmers announced Catch's managing director - former Amazon executive Pete Sauerborn - would depart and the business would be moved out of its Kmart division into a new data and digital arm called OneDigital. From the outside, it appears Wesfarmers is moving to restructure and hopefully stem its losses at Catch. But a key question remains: why, during a period when online shopping has seen rampant growth, is a business like Catch struggling at all? The answer, according to some familiar with the business before Wesfarmers' purchase, is an erosion of the very start-up culture lauded by Scott. Like many start-ups, Catch was tightly focused on costs and ran as a very lean business - a stance inherently at odd with a heavily corporatised, governance-focused conglomerate such as Wesfarmers. Following the purchase, a steady stream of new managers and consultants were brought in to help run the business and manage its new requirements as an entity of one of Australia's largest listed businesses. These new hires, all on respectable salaries, rapidly increased Catch's headcount and its costs, eating away at the business' bottom line. It was also, reportedly, difficult to get Wesfarmers' different divisions - the operations of which are famously kept very separate to each other - to come to the table to discuss how Catch could benefit the broader group, something that the conglomerate may now have acknowledged with the move to put Catch under OneDigital. Ben Gilbert, a veteran retail analyst with investment bank Jarden, told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald he believes one of the main challenges for Catch was pivoting the business away from its âdeal-of-the-day' focus and toward Wesfarmers' goal of it being an all-around marketplace, which could sit hand-in-hand with its similarly placed Kmart and Target department stores. ""If you look at the key ingredients for a successful marketplace, both here and offshore, its range, its price, and its delivery,"" Gilbert says. ""Catch's challenge is that it hasn't been able to push its range quite as aggressively as it's needed to, so it hasn't been front of mind in consumers' heads when they go to buy their next widget."" Gilbert also notes Wesfarmers has spent a significant amount of money on online marketing for Catch in an attempt to better scale the business, which so far hasn't translated into revenue or profit growth. And alongside the operational challenges lies the broader issue of competition. With the online retail space heating up during COVID, competitors such as Kogan, eBay and Amazon have all gained ground, each fighting for customer attention and their dollars, stunting Catch's growth efforts. Gilbert backs the company's choice to move Catch out of the Kmart Group and into the data and digital division, saying it opens the door for Catch to better leverage the strength of the rest of Wesfarmers' retail brands and potentially position the business to act as the overarching online marketplace selling goods from all of the conglomerate's flagship brands. ""Wesfarmers arguably needs a marketplace that sits above all of its brands, where it can still maintain brand integrity with a Bunnings store, a Priceline store, etcetera,"" he says. ""This move shows they're thinking now about a more of a holistic approach and how they're going to leverage the power of those brands."" ""I think that's the natural evolution for Catch."" From Wesfarmers' perspective, while Catch may have underperformed in recent years, the acquisition has been a slam dunk from a valuation perspective, with the online marketplace estimated by some analysts to be worth as much as $2 billion thanks to COVID's online shopping boom. Next week, the company will also open its first Catch fulfilment centre in NSW in an effort to meet growing customer demand. But Wesfarmers can expect to face questions about Catch at its upcoming strategy day in June, with analysts keen to know if the business has dropped the ball, or if it's just a fumble.

836,0,Spotify to link virus content to Covid facts after disinformation row,397 words,Agence France Presse,"""This advisory will direct listeners to our dedicated Covid-19 Hub, a resource that provides easy access to data-driven facts, up-to-date information as shared by scientists, physicians, academics and public health authorities around the world, as well as links to trusted sources,"" Ek said. The ""new effort to combat misinformation"" would roll out in the next few days, he added. The move comes after artists, spearheaded by Neil Young, earlier this week demanded the streaming service remove their music or drop podcaster Joe Rogan after a call from medical professionals to prevent Rogan from promoting ""several falsehoods about Covid-19 vaccines."" Rogan, 54, has discouraged vaccination in young people and promoted the off-label use of the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin to treat the virus. The podcaster, who has a $100 million (90 million euros) multi-year exclusive deal with Spotify, was kept on and Spotify complied with Young's demand and started removing his catalogue of songs. The company voiced ""regret"" over Young's move but cited a need to balance ""both safety for listeners and freedom for creators"". Spotify's move drew applause online from organizations including video-streaming platform Rumble, which credited the Swedish company with ""defending creators"" and standing ""up for free speech"". But Young, 76, also garnered wide praise for taking a stand, including from the World Health Organization chief. The musician also urged fellow artists to follow his lead, and calls for boycotts and cancelled subscriptions flourished on social media. ""Based on the feedback over the last several weeks, it's become clear to me that we have an obligation to do more to provide balance and access to widely-accepted information from the medical and scientific communities guiding us through this unprecedented time,"" Ek said. In addition, Ek said the company would publish its ""Platform Rules"" which includes guidelines for creators on what Spotify labels ""dangerous"" and ""deceptive"" content. jll-map/gw"
265,1,China says will help key industries resume work in locked-down Shanghai,537 words,The Peninsula,"The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will work with 666 companies making semiconductors, automobiles, and the medical sector to get back to work, it said in a statement late on Friday. Teams have been sent to Shanghai to ensure the resumption of work at these key industrial companies, the regulator added. Electric-car maker Xpeng and technology giant Huawei warned of looming industry-wide suspensions of output suspensions if suppliers in Shanghai and surrounding areas cannot resume work, while numerous foreign firms have recently announced production halts at their Chinese plants. Airlines and the property sector are also feeling the pain. Although Shanghai's 23,000 new infections on Friday were down from more than 27,000 the previous day, they included a record 3,200 symptomatic cases, versus 2,573 a day earlier.  Xpeng's Chief Executive He Xiaopeng issued a dire warning for the sector unless the situation improved. ""If the suppliers in Shanghai and its surrounding areas can't find a way to resume operations and production, in May possibly all of China's carmakers will have to stop production,"" he said on the Wechat social media app.  Richard Yu, chief executive of both Huawei's consumer business group and its smart car unit, mirrored He's sentiments in private comments confirmed by the company, adding that the industry faced huge losses. Shipments of some Apple products, as well as Dell and Lenovo laptops could also face delays, analysts said. On Friday the transport ministry announced a national pass system to let cargo vehicles move between higher risk zones without delays, as long as drivers have normal temperatures and a negative virus test no older than 48 hours. An April 7 study by Gavekal Dragonomics found that 87 of China's 100 largest cities by gross domestic product have imposed some form of quarantine curbs. COVID curbs have also hit travel nationwide, with flag carrier Air China reporting a drop of 70% in March traffic from a year ago. Home prices stalled for a second month in a row in China's 70 major cities last month, official data showed on Friday, as the lockdowns sapped consumer confidence and undermined demand. Some of those locked down in Shanghai have expressed frustration on social media over the difficulties in getting food and poor conditions at central quarantine facilities. Most of Shanghai's shops were closed, except for some with half-opened shutters from which goods were being carried to waiting delivery drivers. The city has converted residential buildings into quarantine centres but that is sparking protests from angry neighbours worried about higher risks of infection."
581,1,"Experimental Agriculture; Reports Outline Experimental Agriculture Findings from Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (Response of Maize Yield To Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium and Sulphur Rates On Andosols and Nitisols In Ethiopia)",706 words,Agriculture Week,"The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research, ""This study was carried out to quantify maize yield response and agronomic efficiency of varying application rates of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and sulphur (S) under balanced application of other nutrients across two soil types in Ethiopia. Field trials were set up on 29 farmers' fields in four districts of Oromia and Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR) for three consecutive cropping seasons (2014-2017). The treatments consisted of six rates of N, P and S each and eight rates of K combined with balanced application of the remaining macronutrients, zinc (Zn) and boron (B). The treatments were laid out in randomised complete blocks design with three replicates per farm. Using nutrient dose-response modelling, the agronomic optimum rates of N, P, K and S were estimated at 46, 40, 17 and 10 kg ha(-1) on Nitisols, with balanced application of the other nutrients. On Andosols, the optimum rates of N, P and S were estimated at 184, 20 and 30 kg ha(-1), respectively, but the optimum K rate could not be estimated. The predicted maximum yields obtained with balanced nutrient application were lower on Andosols (3397-3640 kg ha(-1)) than on Nitisols (4630-6094 kg ha(-1)). Using the Mitscherlich dose-response model, the percentage deficiencies of N, P, K and S were estimated to be 1.3-3.3 times more on Nitisols than Andosols. Consequently, agronomic efficiencies of N, P, K and S were significantly lower on Andosols than on Nitisols. It is concluded that balanced application of 46 kg N ha(-1), 40 kg P ha(-1), 17 kg K ha(-1), 10 kg ha(-1) S, 2 kg Zn ha(-1) and 0.5 kg B ha(-1) could be recommended for maize on Nitisols in the study area."" According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""Although this recommendation may also apply to Andosol, further research is needed as the productivity of Andosols appears to be limited by constrains other than N, P, K, S, Zn and B. We also recommend a shift from the blanket fertilizer recommendations to site-specific nutrient management based on good understanding of the variations in crop response with soil type and agroecology and appropriate soil and plant analyses.""

However, according to Mr Barrett, a large number of subscriptions are still not being filled due to a lack of affordability and limited supply. âMedicinal cannabis will be a $US25 billion industry globally by 2026 and Australia alone is growing at 100 per cent in the past 12 months,ï¿½?he said.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 29, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, the IPO offering documents and defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) top-line data of the Phase 1 Clinical Trial indicated that DSG3-CAART had, among other things, worsened certain participants' disease activity scores and necessitated additional systemic medication to improve disease activity after DSG3-CAART infusion; (2) accordingly, DSG3-CAART was not as effective as the Company had represented to investors; (3) therefore, the Company had overstated DSG3-CAART's clinical and/or commercial prospects; and (4) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

""Across the country, businesses are having a hard time finding enough workers to get the job doneâ¦With so many job openings, American businesses are looking to hire skilled workers through our employment-based immigrant and non-immigrant visa programs,"" the senators wrote to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ur M. Jaddou. ""These delays and backlogs cause tremendous harm not only to prospective immigrants and their families who are left living in uncertainty, but also to companies that are waiting to hire them and the communities that are waiting to benefit from their talents.""""Given the workforce shortages faced by communities across the country, we are interested in making sure that USCIS has the resources it needs to cut down on these backlogs and to issue the immigrant visas that Congress has made available,"" the senators continued. Klobuchar has led efforts to address workforce shortages. At a Judiciary Committee hearing last month, she highlighted ways to strengthen Americaâs workforce and maintain its global competitive edge, pointing to how challenges such as the green card backlog hurt American companiesï¿½?ability to recruit and retain workers. In March, Klobuchar joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in urging the Biden administration to quickly increase the number of available H-2B visas for seasonal workers. Minnesota businesses, including the tourism and forestry sectors, rely on temporary workers during their busiest seasons. Last May, Klobuchar introduced bipartisan legislation with Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), and Joni Ernst (R-IA), to increase the number of doctors able to work in rural and medically underserved communities. The Conrad State 30 and Physician Access Reauthorization Act would allow international doctors to remain in the U.S. upon completing their residency under the condition that they practice in rural or underserved areas.The full text of the letter is available HERE and below:Dear Director Jaddou:We write to inquire about the steps that United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is taking to address delays in green card, visa, and work permit application processing so the United States can continue to recruit top talent during a time of workforce shortages.Across the country, businesses are having a hard time finding enough workers to get the job done. Current estimates indicate that the United States has around 11.3 million job openings, and demand for labor far exceeds the supply of available U.S. workers at this time. With so many job openings, American businesses are looking to hire skilled workers through our employment-based immigrant and non-immigrant visa programs.In recent years, however, the path to legally immigrating to the United States has become a rocky one filled with waitlists and backlogs that too often keep the worldâs talent waiting in limbo or away entirely. Currently, about nine million prospective immigrants are awaiting green cards, and for applicants from some countries, the wait will be years-long. In fiscal year 2021, processing delays were partly responsible for the evaporation of roughly 80,000 employment-based green cards. These delays and backlogs cause tremendous harm not only to prospective immigrants and their families who are left living in uncertainty, but also to companies that are waiting to hire them and the communities that are waiting to benefit from their talents.At a recent hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, former USCIS Chief Counsel Lynden Melmed testified that some delays in visa processing were attributable to the lack of options for electronic filing. Given the workforce shortages faced by communities across the country, we are interested in making sure that USCIS has the resources it needs to cut down on these backlogs and to issue the immigrant visas that Congress has made available.Accordingly, we ask that you answer the following questions by April 25, 2022:Do you agree that processing paper applications causes delays in the agencyâs processing of applications that contribute to backlogs and long waits?What options currently exist for applicants to file immigration forms electronically? What plans does the agency have to expand electronic filings?Some programs currently allow applicants to file applications entirely or partially online, while others require an entirely paper application. How has USCIS determined which processes to make electronic, and which to keep as paper applications?In May of 2019, USCIS announced a new strategy called eProcessing to transition to a digital immigration processing system. What steps has the agency taken to implement eProcessing, and what effect, if any, has there been on backlogs as a result of that program?What support can Congress provide to facilitate processing generally and the move toward electronic application processing specifically?

352,0,El Questro warns of season shut-out,517 words,The West Australian,"Exacerbating its concerns are possible restrictions on entry into the Kimberley because of the regionâs low vaccination rates. El Questro usually opens at the end of March for the northern dry season, which runs until the end of September. However, Gâday said uncertainty about the WA border was making it difficult to ready the property by ordering produce, finalising tours and other partnerships with third-party regional tourism operators and hiring staff. Up to half of the 220 seasonal workforce is sourced from interstate. âItâs really about preparing for the season, and that lack of certainty from the Government is a bit of a challenge,ï¿½?Gâday chief executive Grant Wilckens said. âWe just really need some direction as to a plan.ï¿½?Mr Wilckens was commenting before Premier Mark McGowan on Tuesday revealed a new date for the border reopening would be announced âthis monthï¿½?. The superannuation fund-backed Gâday bought El Questro, 100km west of Kununurra, just a year ago after the property was closed in 2020 with the arrival of COVID-19. Relaunched last year, the resort initially did well but it lost significant interstate bookings late in the season when WA borders were closed to NSW and Victoria again with the spread of the virus on the east coast. âWeâre still very pleased that weâve invested in the region. You wouldnât say at the moment though that itâs been a great investment. Long-term, it will be,ï¿½?Mr Wilckens said. El Questro historically relies on international visitors for about 20 per cent of its revenue, with the balance split almost equally between WA and interstate trade. Mr Wilckens said that without guidance from the Government by the end of February, the reopening may have to be delayed or the season scrapped. âIt would be hugely problematic for us to open up on time. We may be able to push it back until the end of April,ï¿½?he said. âWe canât sign up anybody yet because we donât know whatâs happening.ï¿½?Mr Wilckens said experienced, seasonal hospitality workers were in high demand around the country as venues reopened and they were unlikely to come to WA with border restrictions in place. âTrying to get people is not even a consideration at the moment, because they have certainty somewhere else,ï¿½?he said. Gâday owns a portfolio of more than 300 caravan, holiday and resort parks across Australia under the Discovery Parks and Gâday Parks brands. It includes dozens of properties in WA, including Rottnest Islandâs glamping venture."

Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Thousands of lives have been lost and millions have fled their homes. In response to the announced closures, customers turned to Avito, a Russian auction site similar to eBay , in the hope of making money on the soon-to-be-unavailable food items. One meal, consisting of two burgers, two drinks and a cherry pie was listed, with the seller asking for 7,500 Russian rubles, equivalent to Â£47 (as of 3pm on Wednesday). The buyer would need to collect the meal, which was purchased fresh on 9 March, from an address in Moscow. Other snacks for sale included a cherry pie, listed at 2,000 rubles (Â£12), and a sachet of cheese sauce listed at 1,000 rubles. After reports of the inflated prices spread on social media, people began to make a joke of the situation, listing pots of McDonaldâs ketchup for 1,000,000 rubles and one of the fast-food restaurantâs empty crumpled paper bags at 5,000 rubles. Announcing the closure of all McDonaldâs sites on Tuesday, the companyâs president and CEO Chris Kempczinski said: ""The conflict in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis in Europe has caused unspeakable suffering to innocent people. As a System, we join the world in condemning aggression and violence and praying for peace. âIn Russia, we employ 62,000 people who have poured their heart and soul into our McDonaldâs brand to serve their communities. We work with hundreds of local, Russian suppliers and partners who produce the food for our menu and support our brand. And we serve millions of Russian customers each day who count on McDonaldâs .ï¿½?He added: âIn the thirty-plus years that McDonaldâs has operated in Russia, weâve become an essential part of the 850 communities in which we operate. âAt the same time, our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine.ï¿½?

Exports of crude oil accounted for nearly half of total production. Exports of oil products have been fluctuating around 130 Mt since 2015 (124 Mt in 2020). The East Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) oil pipeline (capacity of 80Â Mt/year) that connects production areas in Eastern Siberia to Asian markets enables exports to China.

255,0,"San Jose Hotel Owner Seeks Bankruptcy Court Approval to Sue Law Firm for Malpractice; Fairmont San Jose owner says legal immunity provisions weren't explained by its law firm, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman",571 words,WSJ Pro Bankruptcy,"The reorganization plan that Pillsbury drafted contains more than five pages about immunity in ""legal jargon"" that protects the law firm from a range of claims but was impossible to understand, SC SJ said in its filing on Monday. ""Pillsbury never informed or explained"" to SC SJ that the provisions about legal immunity could absolve the law firm of potential malpractice liability from representing the hotel owner, the filing said. The owner believes it is entitled to seek damages through a malpractice lawsuit. SC SJ said the bankruptcy court should give it limited relief from the part of the approved plan that spells out immunity provisions preventing it from suing Pillsbury for malpractice. ""Doing otherwise rewards Pillsbury for obtaining the releases without"" the consent of SC SJ ""and without the benefit of independent counsel,"" the filing said. The Fairmont San Jose hotel, a frequent venue for technology conferences, filed for bankruptcy last March and was closed after a downturn in business events during the pandemic. The hotel is remarketing itself by switching to Hilton Hotels & Resorts' Signia brand and is taking reservations for late next month. Much of the bankruptcy was marked by fighting between SC SJ and Accor Management U.S. Inc., which operates brands such as Fairmont, Sofitel and Swissotel. Accor had said SC SJ breached their hotel management agreement by replacing Accor and taking the Fairmont name off the hotel. SC SJ hired Pillsbury in July 2020 to help it reject the hotel management agreement with Accor through a chapter 11 filing, a tactic that generally gives companies greater flexibility in freeing themselves from obligations. The relationship with Pillsbury ended in early January. In November, a panel of arbitrators awarded $15 million to Accor, of which $13 million was for damages for breaching their deal. SC SJ said in early January that it believed that Pillsbury was guilty of professional negligence for providing bad advice. That award was ""in glaring contrast to the foundational advice Pillsbury had provided,"" SC SJ said in its Monday court filing. When the hotel owner complained, Pillsbury said ""you released us and cannot sue,"" the court filing said. On Tuesday, Pillsbury told WSJ Pro Bankruptcy that it believes that SC SJ is alleging malpractice to avoid paying legal fees. It said, among other things, that SC SJ's principal signed a declaration saying he understood various provisions of the plan, including the releases. Pillsbury also pointed out that a bankruptcy judge said in June that SC SJ could be liable for damages to Accor for as much as $22 million so the $13 million arbitration award in November shouldn't have come as a surprise.

You can also contact attorney J.C. Sanchez of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at jsanchez@rgrdlaw.com. Lead plaintiff motions for the Stronghold Digital Mining class action lawsuit must be filed with the court no later than June 13, 2022. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Stronghold Digital Mining is a crypto asset mining company focused on mining Bitcoin. In the IPO, Stronghold Digital Mining sold 7,690,400 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $19.00 per share. Stronghold Digital Mining received net proceeds of approximately $132.5 million from the IPO. The proceeds from the IPO were purportedly to be contributed to Stronghold LLC in exchange for Stronghold LLC Units, and Stronghold LLC would purportedly use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including for acquisitions of miners and power generating assets. The Stronghold Digital Mining class action lawsuit alleges that the IPO's Registration Statement was materially false and misleading and omitted to state that: (i) contracted suppliers, including Minerva Semiconductor Corp., were reasonably likely to miss anticipated delivery quantities and deadlines; (ii) due to strong demand and pre-sold supply of mining equipment in the industry, Stronghold Digital Mining would experience difficulties obtaining miners outside of confirmed purchase orders; (iii) as a result, there was a significant risk that Stronghold Digital Mining could not expand its mining capacity as expected; (iv) thus, Stronghold Digital Mining would likely experience significant losses; and (v) consequently, defendants' positive statements about Stronghold Digital Mining's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On March 29, 2022, Stronghold Digital Mining reported a net loss of $0.52 for the fourth quarter of 2021, below analyst estimates of $0.04 earnings per share, while Stronghold Digital Mining's Chief Executive Officer cited ""significant headwinds in our operations which have materially impacted recent financial performance."" On this news, Stronghold Digital Mining's stock price fell approximately 32%. By the commencement of the Stronghold Digital Mining class action lawsuit, Stronghold Digital Mining's stock has traded as low as $4.78 per share. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any purchaser of Stronghold Digital Mining Class A common stock pursuant and/or traceable to the Registration Statement issued in connection with the IPO to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Stronghold Digital Mining class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Stronghold Digital Mining class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Stronghold Digital Mining class action lawsuit. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery of the Stronghold Digital Mining class action lawsuit is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

538,0,Champagne sales have pre-pandemic fizz back,418 words,thetimes.co.uk,"In France 142 million bottles were sold, a 25 per cent jump on 2020, taking consumption back to the 2019 pre-pandemic level. A rebound in foreign demand, especially from the United States  and Britain,[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/pints-of-champagne-could-be-the-next-brexit-dividend-g2dqgp87x]  helped boost earnings to an expected record ï¿½?.5 billion, Jean-Marie BarillÃ¨re, head of the Union of Champagne Houses, said. Before the pandemic sales had levelled off at about ï¿½? billion a year. Producers are talking of good times again in the Champagne region after predictions of collapsing demand were unexpectedly followed by a boom not seen for at least two decades. Fabrice Rosset, head of the Deutz brand, recalled the âfrenetic atmosphere of 1999ï¿½?when demand surged to toast the new millennium. âThe euphoria is even more marked this year,ï¿½?he told Le Monde newspaper. Some of the higher sales were due to restaurants restocking after the 2020 slump but most seemed to stem from changing habits. Unable to travel or take part in nightlife, many people in France and abroad have taken to drinking champagne at home. âClients have decided to treat themselves at home and create new moments for conviviality and sharing, despite the gloomy atmosphere,ï¿½?the ComitÃ© said. The revived demand for the French sparkling wine ï¿½?despite a European fashion for less expensive Italian prosecco and Catalan cava ï¿½?caught the champagne houses by surprise and stocks ran low for some. Dom PÃ©rignon, MoÃ«t & Chandon and Ruinart faced shortages in Spain. This has led many champagne houses to work 24-hour days across three shifts to ensure supplies. âThis rebound is a nice surprise for the people of Champagne after a 2020 that was very impacted by the closure of the main venues for consumption and the absence of events across the world,ï¿½?Maxime Toubart, co-president of the ComitÃ©, said. Winemakers are hoping that the record sales are a sign of a new âgrowth cycleï¿½?for champagne but many are worried about the impact of spring frosts and a cool rainy summer last year, which heavily cut the grape harvest across France."

(Nasdaq: BFI, BFIIW) (""BurgerFi"" or the ""Company""), owner of one of the nation's leading fast-casual ""better burger"" dining concepts through the BurgerFi brand, and the high-quality, casual dining pizza brand under the name Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza & Wings (""Anthony's""), today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2021. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Key Metrics(1) Summary BurgerFi Brand Only Three Months Twelve Months Ended Ended (in thousands, except for percentage December 31, December 31, data) 2021 2021 --------------- ----------------- Systemwide Restaurant Sales $ 40,701 $ 166,121 Systemwide Restaurant Sales Growth 23% 31% Systemwide Restaurant Same Store Sales Growth 7% 14% Corporate Restaurant Sales $ 8,736 $ 33,435 Corporate Restaurant Sales Growth 33% 39% Corporate Restaurant Same Store Sales Growth 5% 14% Franchise Restaurant Sales $ 31,737 $ 127,165 Franchise Restaurant Sales Growth 22% 30% Franchise Restaurant Same Store Sales Growth 7% 15% Digital Channel Orders Growth (4)% 18% Digital Channel Orders 550 2,482 Digital Channel Orders % of Systemwide Sales 36% 39% 1. Refer to ""Key Metrics Definitions"" and ""About Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" sections below. Management Commentary  Ophir Sternberg, Executive Chairman of BurgerFi, stated, ""2021 was a fantastic year of growth and transformation at BurgerFi despite the many industry-wide effects of COVID-19. We were able to lay the foundation for significant growth through opening 16 BurgerFi restaurants and through the acquisition of Anthony's in November. I have the utmost confidence in our strengthened management team to execute on our business initiatives, maximize the potential of our two great restaurant brands, and deliver value to our shareholders as we head into 2022.""  Ian Baines, Chief Executive Officer of BurgerFi, added, ""The fourth quarter capped off a year of significant growth for BurgerFi. In the quarter, we initiated the integration of Anthony's into the BurgerFi system. The BurgerFi brand also performed strongly with a 23% growth in systemwide sales, driven primarily through new store openings and a 7% increase in same store sales. Of note, we retained nearly all of our digital channel sales when compared to peak COVID-19 levels, which is very encouraging. In 2022, we expect to realize $2 million in our first wave of cost synergies from the BurgerFi and Anthony's combination, with additional opportunity for 2023. We plan to expand access and convenience for our guests through continued investments in technological advancements, innovation and our digital ecosystem, accompanied by the 15 to 20 expected new BurgerFi brand restaurant openings we have planned for 2022. This unit growth and enhanced omni-channel customer experience, combined with the incredible food we offer should provide the foundation for an outstanding 2022."" Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results Total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased 261% to $35.1 million compared to $9.7 million in the year-ago quarter, driven by the addition of two months of operations of the Anthony's business acquired on November 3, 2021, additional revenue from new restaurants opened during the period and an increase in royalty and other fees. Systemwide sales in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased 23% to $40.7 million compared to $33.2 million in the prior year period. Same store sales increased 5% and 7% in corporate-owned and franchised locations, respectively, and were supported by an increase in average check, resulting from the strong performance of new menu items such as the SWAG burger (Spicy Wagyu burger) and price increases instituted towards the end of the second quarter. Restaurant-level operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $27.5 million compared to $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, which includes two months of operations of the Anthony's business, which was acquired on November 3, 2021. Restaurant-level operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 340 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher labor costs. Net loss attributable to common shareholders in the fourth quarter was $117.3 million compared to a net income attributable to common shareholders and controlling interests of $6.0 million in the year-ago quarter. The loss resulted primarily from $114.8 million of non-cash impairment charges, and $2.1 million of acquisition-related costs and certain investments made after becoming a public company in December of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased 231% to $2.6 million compared to $0.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by the acquisition of Anthony's and BurgerFi's revenue growth, partially offset by the investments made related to being a public company and those to drive the growth and development of corporate-owned restaurants. See the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, and the reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP measures below. Full Year 2021 Financial Results Total revenue in 2021 increased 103% to $68.9 million compared to $34.0 million in 2020, driven by the addition of two months of operations of the Anthony's business acquired on November 3, 2021, the addition of new restaurants opened during the period, and an increase in royalties and other fees. Systemwide sales in 2021 rose 31% to $166.1 million compared to $126.9 million in 2020. Same store sales increased 14% and 15% in corporate-owned and franchised locations, respectively, and were supported by an increase in average check value, resulting from menu innovation at the end of the first quarter and price increases instituted towards the end of the second quarter. Restaurant-level operating expenses for 2021 were $50.4 million compared to $22.1 million in the prior year period. Restaurant-level operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, improved for the full year 2021 by 110 basis points, compared to the full year of 2020, due to a change in our sales mix, more efficiently managing our costs of delivery through third party suppliers, reduced other store operating expenses, and leverage on occupancy costs, that are relatively fixed in nature. Net loss attributable to common shareholders in 2021 was $121.5 million compared to a net income attributable to common shareholders and controlling interests of $6.0 million in 2020. The loss resulted primarily from $114.8 million non-cash impairment charges, $7.6 million of non-cash share-based compensation expenses, $4.3 million of acquisition-related costs, $1.9 million of pre-opening costs and certain investments related to becoming a public company in December 2020. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 72% in 2021, from $2.2 million in the prior year to $3.8 million in 2021. This growth was driven by the addition of two months of operations of the Anthony's business acquired on November 3, 2021, revenue growth from new restaurants and a 14% increase in systemwide same store sales, partially offset by the investments related to being a public company and investments associated with the resources to support accelerated corporate-owned restaurant development. See the reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP measures below. Liquidity On December 31, 2021, the Company had $14.9 million in cash, compared to $37.2 million on December 31, 2020. BurgerFi repaid and then terminated its $3.0 million revolving credit line in the first quarter of 2021, repaid $9.2 million of debt acquired in the acquisition of Anthony's and invested $10.7 million in capital expenditures in 2021. 2022 Outlook The Company acknowledges the challenges many in the industry are facing, including shortages of materials and labor for construction and development, along with elevated economic uncertainty. With that, management is reiterating the following expectations for the full year 2022 assuming the current economic environment does not change materially: -- Annual revenues of $180-190 million. -- Mid-single digit same-store sales growth. -- 15-20 new BurgerFi brand restaurant openings, most of which will be franchised locations. -- Adjusted EBITDA of $12-14 million. -- Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $4 million.

Key Metrics Definitions The following definitions apply to the terms listed below: ""Systemwide Restaurant Sales"" is presented as informational data in order to understand the aggregation of franchised stores sales, ghost kitchen and corporate-owned stores sales performance.

Systemwide restaurant same store sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants, ghost kitchens, and corporate-owned restaurants once the restaurant has been in operation after 14 months. See definition below for same store sales. ""Corporate-Owned Restaurant Sales"" represent the sales generated only by corporate-owned restaurants that are open for the full year. Corporate-owned restaurant sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all corporate-owned restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Corporate-owned restaurant same store sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all corporate-owned restaurants once the restaurant has been in operation after 14 months. These measures highlight the performance of existing corporate-owned restaurants.

""Same Store Sales"" is used to evaluate the performance of our store base, which excludes the impact of new stores and closed stores, in both periods under comparison. We include a restaurant in the calculation of same store sales once it has been in operation after 14 months. A restaurant which is temporarily closed (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), is included in the same store sales computation. A restaurant which is closed permanently, such as upon termination of the lease, or other permanent closure, is immediately removed from the same store sales computation. Our calculation of same store sales may not be comparable to others in the industry.

About Non-GAAP Projected Financial Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the measure Adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use this non-GAAP financial measure for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. This non-GAAP financial measure also facilitates management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors both because (1) it allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) it is used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.

We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from this non-GAAP financial measure and evaluating this non-GAAP financial measure together with its relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.

44,0,Cost rises hit COVID plans,927 words,The West Australian,"The unified approach of those early days quickly splintered and within two weeks Premier Mark McGowan had slammed WAâs border shut to the rest of the country, creating his much-vaunted âisland within an islandï¿½? The health, economic and political success of that approach over the past 24 months is well established: whether your metric is deaths, retail spending or seats in Parliament the McGowan Government has outperformed its peers. The âsoft landingï¿½?the Premier hoped for when delaying (and delaying and delaying) the reopening of WAâs border also appears likely, though legitimate questions are now being asked about whether the case load peak has been pushed too close to winter. But while a bumpy COVID landing may have been averted there is now growing turbulence on another front. The home front. Everything from petrol to baked beans is suddenly rocketing in cost and hitting Australians where they hurt most ï¿½?the hip pocket. While Australia ï¿½?and WA especially ï¿½?have been shielded from the worst health impacts of COVID, the virus has wrought havoc globally, both shutting down factories for stretches at a time and throwing into disarray what are usually complex and finely tuned international supply chains. Ironically, Australiaâs long period cut-off from the world has also played a role ï¿½?slashing flights into and around the country took away a major source of freight, further increasing competition for sea containers that were already in short supply. More recently, Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine last month put a rocket under oil costs, though they were already climbing at a fairly rapid clip prior to Vladimir Putinâs brutal power play. Diesel and petrol are a crucial input in the broader economy, even more so in an isolated trading State like WA which relies on massive volumes of goods being transported by sea, road and air. The upshot of all this is most apparent at the bowser where records are tumbling daily. Perth motorists were charged an average 212.9Â¢ a litre of unleaded on Wednesday ï¿½?up from 167Â¢ a litre in January. It is also evident in supermarket aisles where the price of everything from fruit and vegetables to coffee and tinned food is on the rise. Second-hand cars in some cases are selling for nearly as much as new models ï¿½?for which buyers are being told to expect waits of up to a year. There is no clearer illustration that cost of living has replaced COVID at the front of Australiansï¿½?minds than polling commissioned by The West that found petrol prices were a key election issue for 48 per cent of 1500 respondents spread across five battleground WA electorates. By contrast, just 31 per cent said they were worried about COVID. And this poll was taken last week, as case numbers crept ever closer to their peak and West Australians have never been more exposed to the virus. Two Budgets ï¿½?Federal next week and State in May ï¿½?will reveal how Prime Minister Scott Morrison and McGowan choose to confront the cost-of-living rises. The stakes for Morrison ï¿½?who must face voters by May 21 ï¿½?are obviously much higher, and there have already been a steady stream of hints from both the PM and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg that a temporary reduction in fuel excise could be on the cards. Extending the low-to-middle income tax offset ï¿½?worth up to $1080 ï¿½?is also likely, while in recent days there have been reports one-off cash payments between $200 and $400 are also under consideration. Clearly, national debt creeping towards $1 trillion can wait ï¿½?at least until after the election. Which brings us to McGowan. If there is any State or Territory in a financial position to countenance the kind of handouts being cooked up in Canberra, it is WA ï¿½?which is on track to bank a second straight surplus of $5 billion or more. But with three years until West Australians cast judgment on their State Government again, the incentive for generosity is somewhat less compelling. And letâs not forget we are not even 18 months removed from every WA household receiving a $600 electricity credit after the Bell Group settlement. A State Budget handed down in the last frantic days of a Federal election campaign would also provide useful cover for unpopular announcements. The McGowan Governmentâs stated policy is to keep utility increases in line with inflation. At 5.7 per cent, that would add about $200 combined to the power and water bills of the average WA household. Asked in question time on Tuesday whether he would freeze power and water bills in recognition of cost-of-living pressures, McGowan said his Government âunderstand that the issue is out there in the communityï¿½?and was âvery aware of it in the lead-up to the preparation of the Budgetï¿½? That is far from an ironclad commitment. McGowan has shown through the pandemic he is not afraid to break from the national approach. On cost of living, however, West Australians will pray he is in lockstep with Canberra. A State Budget handed down in the last frantic days of a Federal election campaign would also provide useful cover for unpopular announcements."

Sales of so-called third-segment quasi-beer have been stagnant since a liquor tax hike for the product category in October 2020. Meanwhile, sales of beer for households grew at some companies that introduced new products or renewed existing products, thanks to steady demand for drinking at home amid the pandemic. By volume, sales fell 12 pct at Sapporo Breweries Ltd. and 11 pct at Kirin Brewery Co. while Suntory Beer Ltd. saw its sales drop slightly.

361,0,IN BRIEF,512 words,The Australian,"Peak stake sale Peak Rare Earths, an ASX-listed mining junior, confirmed reports overnight on Monday that Chinese giant Shenghe Resources had acquired 19.9 per cent in the company from Appian Pinnacle. Shares rose 6.9 per cent to close at 85c on Monday. Shenghe has a market capitalisation of about $US4.9bn ($6.9bn). Tony Pearson, Peakâs chairman, said Shenghe was âa leading participant in the global rare earth sector and we view its investment as a strong endorsement of the world-class nature of Peakâs integrated Ngualla-Teesside rare earth projectï¿½? Rebecca Morgan, a nominee director of Appian, has resigned. Peak expects to be handed a special mining licence covering its rare earth project in the south of Tanzania within months.  Praemium pressure Shares in investment advice group Praemium fell more than 13.8 per cent to $1.06 on Monday after the company reported margin pressure despite a rise in revenues. Funds under advice for the six months to December 31 rose 43 per cent to $49bn compared to the previous corresponding period, the company told the ASX. In that time, the company has sold some of its operations ï¿½?in the UK, Hong Kong and Dubai ï¿½?to Morningstar, pushing earnings from international activities down 94 per cent. âWe also believe that we are now at a scale threshold at which a significant percentage of revenue will convert to underlying EBITDA, especially since we essentially have a full complement of staff for the first time in the recent past,ï¿½?chief executive Anthony Wamsteker said. âThis achievement should not be underestimated in light of the challenging Covid recruitment market.ï¿½?Revenues rose 25 per cent to $39.2m, but expenses rose 30 per cent, the company said. Soul Pattsï¿½?RFG move Investment giant Washington H. Soul Pattinson has increased its stake in Retail Food Group, known for the Donut King, Gloria Jeanâs, Brumbyâs Bakery, and Michelâs Patisserie outlets. A substantial shareholder notice shows WHSP spent more than $1.1m to buy a parcel of just over 16.7 million shares at 6.6c apiece on Thursday and Friday last week, which takes the companyâs stake in the business to 7.85 per cent."

888,0,The BBC needs defenders in an age of disinformation,752 words,Financial Times,"At the other end of the spectrum, former Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore once the prime minister's boss declared that the BBC has been behaving like ""the Fox News of the Left"". The broadcaster, Moore wrote, needed to show not just impartiality which director-general Tim Davie has repeatedly said must be a priority but ""super-impartiality"", whatever that might mean. GB News presenter Dan Wootton raged that during the pandemic ""the BBC's coverage has been nothing short of a disgrace"". Such views are hardly borne out by the public, measured either by viewing or polling figures. In March 2020, when Britain went into its first lockdown, the BBC's nightly news audience soared to 15m. According to the broadcaster's latest annual report, 8 out of 10 British adults continue to use at least one BBC news service a week. The UK regulator Ofcom's latest report shows the BBC takes up seven spots in the top-20 most-used news sources. More than two-thirds of the public say the BBC is effective at providing news and current affairs coverage that is ""trustworthy"", while 49 per cent cite the BBC as the source they turn to for news they most trust. Some, such as anti-Brexit campaigner and lawyer Jolyon Maugham, say such dominance is unhealthy, as it means the BBC can rely on residual trust rather than having to earn it. Maugham also complains that the BBC's survival is ""contingent on pleasing those in power"". But neither of these criticisms seem fair the broadcaster is as often criticised for being too aggressive as it is for being too cosy with politicians. The idea that getting rid of BBC News, as Maugham advocates, might somehow improve the media landscape is a fallacy. Part of the reason that the UK is less susceptible to online disinformation than some other countries is that the national broadcaster sets a high standard for others to follow. The truth is that the very fact the BBC is complained about so much by both sides of the political spectrum is proof that it is succeeding, at least to some extent, at providing balanced coverage. It is hard to imagine such denunciation from both sides in the highly polarised, commercially driven world of US media, where just 12 per cent of Republicans trust the Democrats' favourite CNN, and just 14 per cent of Democrats trust the Republicans' preferred Fox News. When misinformation proliferates online and seeps out into the real world, with echo chambers splintering people into tribes that struggle to understand each other, having a single source of truth, flawed as it might be, is something we shouldn't take for granted. ""One of the fundamental principles of public service broadcasting is that it is universally available to all. This talk of getting rid of the licence fee and going to subscriptions by definition would lose that,"" says Patrick Barwise, co-author of The War Against the BBC and emeritus professor of management and marketing at London Business School. Even those who say they don't want to be forced to pay for the service perhaps protest too much. In a socalled ""deprivation study"" in 2015 commissioned by the BBC although carried out by an independent firm more than two-thirds of those who had said they were opposed to paying the licence fee changed their minds just nine days after being cut off from the BBC's services. Barwise says a new, yet-to-be-published study had almost identical findings. We need to leave Auntie alone she's far from perfect, but our media landscape and, thus, our democracy, would surely be in much worse shape without her. That's something worth defending, not defunding. jemima.kelly@ft.com"

Govind, told presspersons here on Monday the judgment that came on February 3 said that owners of eateries, hotels, shops and restaurants were at liberty to fix closing time for their establishment. Earlier, hotels were asked to close down at 11 p.m. and that was advanced to 10.30 p.m. Following the judgement, the police are not insisting on the hotels to shutdown by 10.30 p.m. The Tamil Nadu Hoteliers Association representatives are discussing with the police to ensure the court order is implemented across the State. âWe had several restrictions during lockdown period and hotels have revived only recently. Business has reached pre-pandemic levels. The order will support us and will only help the hotels,ï¿½?said Mr. Balachander. The Coimbatore District Hoteliers Association had 250 members. The district was expected to have over 1,500 hotels. For most of them, business went on till 11 p.m. and some hotels got customers till midnight too. So the decision of closing down for the day should be left to the owners of the hotels, they said. We had several restrictions during lockdown and hotels have revived only recently R.

111,1,"Huckelberry retirement legal, but lessons learned",695 words,The Arizona Daily Star,"The Board of Supervisors renewed Mr. Huckelberryâs contract for an additional four years in January 2021. He has served as the county administrator since 1993. We inserted into his contract a provision that allowed him to retire and return to work as a contractor without affecting any of the contractâs terms. However, we did not add language that required Mr. Huckelberry to notify us if and when he retired.  Arizona State Retirement System records show that Mr. Huckelberry initiated his retirement on July 4, 2021. He continued to receive full pay up until the time that he was involved in a bicycling accident on Oct. 23, 2021. Two days after that accident, he began to use accrued sick and/or vacation leave and continued to receive his full pay. This continued until Nov. 14, 2021. Beginning on Nov. 15, 2021, Mr. Huckelberry began to use 19 hours of accrued sick and/or vacation leave so that he could be in compliance with the ASRS 20/20 rule. This rule states that an ASRS retiree cannot work for any ASRS employer for more than 20 hours per week for 20 or more weeks in a fiscal year. After 12 months, the retiree can return to full-time work and their pension benefits continue. This is often referred to as âdouble-dippingï¿½?and is allowed under ASRS regulations. According to our Human Resources Department, if Mr. Huckelberry had continued to use 19 hours of accrued leave through the week of May 2, 2022, he would have been in compliance with the ASRS 20/20 rule. Since he began using accrued leave in November of last year, he received part-time pay and all the terms of his contract. The Board accepted his resignation on April 5, 2022 and the contract was terminated as of that date. If Mr. Huckelberry had not been involved in a tragic accident in October of last year, I am certain that Board members, both individually and collectively, would be engaged in dialogue with him about why he did not let us know that he had retired in July. For both interpersonal and political reasons, it would have been ideal for him to notify us of his decision. Nevertheless, in taking the action he did, there was no violation of his contract, nor of ASRS regulations. What are the lessons learned? First, we should have inserted language into the contract requiring that Mr. Huckelberry notify us when he initiated his retirement. The Board should have also anticipated the need for Mr. Huckelberryâs compliance with the 20/20 rule and inserted language into the contract as to how his duties would be addressed during that 20-week period. I certainly should have considered that fact since I am an ASRS retiree myself. Mr. Huckelberry began his professional career with Pima County in 1974 and worked within the Transportation Department before being named the county administrator 19 years later. He is a hometown boy who made Pima County a better place to live, work and raise a family. I am sorry, as a new supervisor, that I was only able to work alongside this extraordinary public servant for less than a year. Nothing associated with either his resignation or retirement detracts from the fact that our entire community owes him and his family a sincere debt of gratitude.

699,1,Publicis Groupe Starts The Year Off Strong With 10.5% Growth In Q1,378 words,MediaPost.com,"By region, organic growth was strongest in Europe at 14.9% which the group said was fueled by particularly strong performances in the UK and France. Asia Pacific was not far behind at 14.4%. Middle East/Africa and Latin America both posted 13%-plus growth. Growth in North America remained strong at 8.1%, where data unit Epsilon was called out as a key performer. Digital transformation division Publicis Sapient was also cited as a key contributor with 16.3% growth (and 18.5% growth globally). Media operations in the NA region were up double-digits and creative units were up by mid-single digits, with production being a standout performer. Canada was up 11.7% and the U.S. came in at 8%. While the quarter overall was stronger than expected the firm said it was standing by guidance issued earlier in the year with organic growth expected at the high end of its previously stated range of 4% to 5%. But macroeconomic wildcards including high inflation and the continuing potential impact of the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine on the global economy create too much uncertainty to raise guidance at this time, the Groupe said. Organic growth in the second quarter is expected to be around 5%, versus the 17.1% achieved in the second quarter 2021. The latter performance reflected the Groupe's rebound from COVID-stricken 2020. ""We started the year very strongly,"" said Publicis Groupe CEO Arthur Sadoun. ""Our model is going from strength to strength as it continues to capture rising client demand for first-party data, digital media and commerce."" The company's strong Q1 performance coincided with an upsurge in major account wins which bodes well for subsequent quarters when revenues from those wins fully kick in.

519,1,Raslag: Proceeds from IPO to fund solar power projects,528 words,Business Mirror,"The public offer period will run from May 19 to 25 while the listing date is on June 6. The IPO, said its founder Engineer Peter Nepomuceno, is part of Raslag's business expansion and development efforts. 'With this, the company will be able to raise up to P700 million that will be mainly channeled to funding the development and construction of its pipeline solar projects, namely RASLAG-4 and 5, and general corporate purposes,' the company said in a statement it released to reporters after officials held an online news briefing. 'Land has already been acquired for RASLAG-4 and 5 and is being paid on installment basis. Advanced development works, including land use conversion, are currently ongoing for both projects as well. Raslag now owns a total of 108 hectares of land for 5 solar projects and we are looking to acquire more for our pipeline,' said Nepomuceno. It has commenced work for the development of the 35.2-megawatt peak (MWp) RASLAG-4 solar plant and has acquired the site for the 60 MWp RASLAG-5 solar plant, both in Pampanga. RASLAG IV will cost P1.5 billion while the project cost for RASLAG V is estimated at P2.1 billion. A pioneer in the country's grid-scale solar energy development, Raslag currently has two solar power plants: the 10.046MWp RASLAG-1 and the 13.141 MWp RASLAG-2. Both are running under the Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) system of the Department of Energy (DOE) with a base tariff of P9.68/kWh and P8.69/kWh, respectively. According to Nepomuceno, securing these long-term contracts with the government provided the company a steady stream of cash flow to reinvest in the business for expansion and raise equity. The FIT scheme also encouraged and accelerated the demand for renewable energy, which they wanted to maximize. At the same time, Nepomuceno announced that the 18.011 MWp RASLAG-3 in Mabalacat and Magalang, Pampanga will commence operation on May 2. 'We are now able to generate more solar energy for less land and for even less cost. This makes solar energy a particularly attractive option in the country, which is in line with DOE targets.' Anchored on the Nepomuceno family's long history of building enduring businesses, institutions, and landmarks in Pampanga, Raslag assures that it will be a solid partner to investors, one that is focused on delivering sustainable, profitable, and high-quality growth for all shareholders. 'We started Raslag in 2013 in response to the government's push for renewable energy as well as to address the projected demand for clean power,' said Nepomuceno."

419,1,China's stock market offers growing support to the real economy: PHBS Think Tank report,386 words,PR Newswire Asia,"In addition, the newly-established Beijing Stock Exchange (BSE) marks a key step in China's efforts to deepen capital market reform, according to the report. Of the first batch of 81 companies listed on the newly-established (BSE), 78 % are SMEs in advanced manufacturing, modern services, high-tech services and strategic industries. Based on this, the report suggests that the BSE is playing a significant role in stimulating the direct financing of SMEs in the National Equities Exchange and Quotations, further enhancing the financing capability of China's multi-level capital market. However, due to mixed pressure from refinancing, financial fraud, ineffective regulation, and irrational speculators, China's stock market is still dealing with multiple challenges to attract medium and long-term funds, according to the Think Tank. Researchers suggest that an effective issuance system, a transaction system, and a transparent regulation need to be implemented. For instance, the efficiency of the registration-based IPO system requires highly transparent information disclosure and proactive financing regulation. Effective policies to attract long-term capital and improve risk management are needed to curb the irrational speculation of both individual and institutional investors and ensure sustainable development of the equity market.

960,0,"Delhi orders closing of restaurants, bars; industry says move a death knell for struggling sector",893 words,The Economic Times,"""Right from the onset of Covid, the restaurant sector has been one of the worst-hit. We were the first ones to be shut and almost the last ones to restart during the first and second lockdowns and I reckon that this third wave is going to be even worse than last year. We somehow survived so far, but with the new guidelines announced today in Delhi it seems highly unlikely that we can sustain any longer,"" he said. ""We were shut for most part of last year. We have been operating at 50% capacity and restricted hours since then. We had just about started seeing some respectable surge in consumption which prompted us to hire back our people and now we are left in a lurch. These new guidelines, which prohibit dining completely and allow only deliveries are completely unsustainable. It is like an excruciating and painful slow death for an erstwhile vibrant industry,"" he added. Rahul Singh, founder and CEO of The Beer CafÃ© that has 13 outlets in Delhi, said not all businesses are geared towards deliveries and takeaways. ""Our business is not an on and off button We should get adequate time for such measures. What will happen to our raw materials? There are perishable timelines for everything. Abrupt knee jerk reactions should be avoided,"" he said and added that was he trying to transfer Delhi's supply to Gurugram and Noida. Priyank Sukhija, CEO of First Fiddle that runs brands such as Lord of the Drinks, Cafe JLWA, Diablo, and The Flying Saucer said existing measures such as weekend curfews and being allowed to stay open till 10 pm anyway implied restaurants, pubs and bars would be as good as shut. Sukhija had previously told ET he had temporarily relieved 30% of his existing staff this month. ""We have been struggling for the last two years. It's high time they make up for this. Once things get better, the new excise policy that has been passed by the Delhi legislative assembly has to be implemented. They have taken the excise fee as per the new policy, which lowers the drinking age from 25 to 21 and allows bars to stay open till 3 am. We were promised this and should be given when cases go down. Currently, we don't have an option but to close,ï¿½?he said. Aseem Grover, owner of the popular Big Chill CafÃ© chain in the national capital said it seemed that the government was running out of ideas. ""What do I say when people are travelling in the metros, buses, going to the markets. I see no reason why we could not have carried on with 50% capacity. Airlines are occupied and serving food. The middle seats are occupied,ï¿½?he said. ""So, thatâs exactly what they are also doing on planes. It looks like we are the soft targets as always and in the light of all the political rallies going on, it seems ridiculous. It's going to be a death knell for restaurants. If your graded response has F&B deliveries continuing even in the highest level of red alert, I donât see why deliveries have to stop at 10 pm. At the very least they should extend delivery timings as taking the last order at 9 pm completely kills the dinner business. There is no scientific basis to prove night curfews help curb the spread,ï¿½?he added. He said business overall business over the last weekend was just 30-40% of the pre Christmas numbers and dine-ins are still very important for the chain. ""As it is it's very little that one is getting from the government. There has been no relief on even things such as utility bills. The staff has to be paid. The landlords are also getting more and more reluctant to give discounted rates with every passing wave,"" he added. Zorawar Kalra, managing director of Massive Restaurants that runs brands such as Farzi CafÃ©, Made in Punjab and Bo Tai said he was hoping that if hospitalisations and morbidities don't increase, these restrictions can be quickly removed as they are extremely debilitating for the already beleaguered industry, and will result in a major increase in permanent closures and unemployment in the sector.

480,0,Recall workers before it's too late,808 words,National Post,"But with the lifting of capacity limits comes another warning to employers: recall employees to the workplace before it's too late. Although some sectors, such as tech, have embraced remote work and shifted to that model permanently, many employers are patiently waiting for their empty offices to be filled. We wrote on this topic in October, when we cautioned that permitting employees to work from home longer than legally necessary risked making that a permanent term of their employment. In such a scenario, an employee who was later forced back to the office could claim the move amounted to a constructive dismissal, refuse to attend and sue for wrongful dismissal if the employer did not back down. That was two lockdowns and two waves of COVID ago. The news that the latest lockdown is coming to an end makes it now opportune for employers to advise employees that they are required to return to work. Some tips to remember are: ? The time to recall employees to the office is limited. The sooner employers act, the less likely an employee can claim constructive dismissal. If employers act quickly enough and employees refuse to return to the office, they have abandoned their employment. ? Employers should document these communications: a phone call is not sufficient protection. ? And finally, if remote work is the new norm, employers should offer new contracts that include workfrom-home rules. Employers legally have a choice of offering employees their jobs back at the office at their existing remuneration but offering a lesser amount if they prefer to work from home. With a shortage of workers though, that may not be practical. Many employers will fail to address these issues and 2022 may just become the year of ""return-to-work"" constructive dismissal claims, just as 2020 was with COVID-19 layoffs and 2021 with vaccine mandates. As with those other claims, the employer's timing and proper documentation will play a key role in deciding whether employees will receive an award of damages. Employers should not view the Jan. 20 announcement as just another false alarm, but rather, take Premier Ford at his word and act accordingly Many employers who failed to properly handle temporary layoffs and vaccine policies have spent a considerable amount in damages and legal fees over the past two years. Employment lawyers have moved from niche practitioners to some of the most in-demand legal specialists due to these kinds of policy errors by employers. Some employee-side law firms have even instituted bonuses based on the number of claims filed by associates each month. At our firm, when acting for employers, we are receiving fewer demand letters Instead, employer clients are being served statements of claim without warning. Many of these claims could have been avoided. It is never too late to get your business's documents up to date and in order. Drafting contracts that will survive judicial scrutiny is the first step. With so much uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, employers are well-advised to determine now their intentions as to which employees will be permanently granted work-from-home status and to provide instructions and documentation accordingly. And to be clear: It is the employer's right to decide which employees that will be - provided they act quickly. Financial Post Got a question about employment law during COVID-19?

153,0,McDonaldâs swallows cost of closing its Russian outlets,411 words,thetimes.co.uk,"Kevin Ozan , executive vice-president and chief financial officer at McDonaldâs , told the UBS Global Consumer and Retail Conference: âWe expect this to be temporary and we certainly donât take this decision lightly. But for us this is about doing what we think is the right thing to do, both for the global business and for our people locally.ï¿½? McDonaldâs , which traces its roots back almost seven decades, is based in Chicago. The company has 38,000 restaurants around the world. Most are franchised, although it directly owns the majority of its outlets in Russia, where it employs 62,000 staff. The burger chainâs business across Russia and Ukraine ï¿½?where it has also shut about 100 outlets ï¿½?typically generates approximately 9 per cent of its annual revenue and 3 per cent of operating income. It has pledged to keep paying employees in both countries. âThis is a really challenging and complex situation for a global company like us,ï¿½?Ozan said, a day after McDonaldâs broke its silence. At $50 million, the monthly cost of its closures across Russia is significant, but bearable for a business that generated net income of almost $1.64 billion in the last quarter. Shares in McDonaldâs rose $1.40, or 0.6 per cent, to $224.26 in New York. It has a market value of $167 billion.  Chris Kempczinski , chief executive and president, acknowledged earlier this week that it was âimpossible to predictï¿½?when its Russian restaurants would reopen. He told employees on Tuesday that his company âcannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraineï¿½?and said it would continue to monitor developments and consider whether âadditional measuresï¿½?would be required. The nature of these measures was not specified. Its first Russian restaurant, opened in Moscow three decades ago, had been deemed a beacon of capitalism as the Soviet Union fell. The outlet is claimed to have served some 30,000 customers on its first day of business."
210,0,KFC Owner Closes Chinese Fast Food Brand East Dawning,274 words,Yicai Global,"Yum China revealed the plan last month and according to the companyâs annual report there were five East Dawning stores in China as of Dec. 31.  Yum China owns several well-known food and beverage brands such as KFC and Pizza Hut. East Dawning was Yum Chinaâs first Chinese fast-food brand, which opened its first outlet in Shanghai in April 2005 and had around 30 stores in China as of 2012. East Dawningâs business performance has been lackluster. Compared with other brands under Yum China, East Dawning has not been able to create a scale effect, Shanghai Observer said, citing an industry insider. Besides Covid-19, the reasons for East Dawningâs failure are lack of clear market positioning and star products as well as increasing local competition, it added.  Yum Chinaâs net profit surged 26 percent last year to USD990 million and operating income rose 19 percent to USD9.8 billion, per its annual earnings report released on March 1.

257,0,"Williamsburg Hotel's Owners Siphoned Off Cash, Bankruptcy Examiner Says; The Brooklyn hotel's developers deny the allegations, saying the examiner spun a false narrative to run up fees",904 words,WSJ Pro Bankruptcy,"The examiner, Eric Huebscher, determined the developers ""controlled both sides of the accounting ledger, preventing open disclosure of financial and accounting transactions, and allowing for the siphoning of funds"" from the hotel to ""unrelated investments."" The hotel's owner said in court papers Monday the report is ""full of mischaracterizations, false statements, and outright defamatory and baseless conclusions"" and was developed in close coordination with the hotel's secured mortgage lender, Benefit Street Partners LLC. The examiner identified an aggregate $12.5 million sent from the management company to other entities connected with Ms. Moskovits and Mr. Lichtenstein, as well as other legally questionable transactions, according to the report, filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y. The report ""creates a false narrative, and is replete with deliberate misstatements, false claims and conclusions, in spite and in the face of evidence and facts that have proven such claims to be false,"" according to the hotel's owner, 96 Wythe Acquisition LLC. The report will influence the hotel's ongoing efforts to exit chapter 11 under a restructuring plan backed by Ms. Moskovits' and Mr. Lichtenstein's Heritage Equity Partners but opposed by Benefit Street. The hotel stopped paying interest in 2018 on its mortgage loan, which matured in 2019 without repayment before the hotel filed for chapter 11 protection last year to avoid foreclosure. Mr. Lichtenstein said in a declaration filed Monday that Mr. Huebscher misused his position to act as a ""passionate advocate"" for Benefit Street's claims and positions and was in ""almost daily contact"" with the lender's lawyers. A bankruptcy judge appointed Mr. Huebscher to conduct an outside examination in November after the lender raised allegations [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/williamsburg-hotels-top-lender-challenges-chapter-11-exit-plan-11642552221] that Ms. Moskovits and Mr. Lichtenstein had diverted revenue and other funds from the hotel to affiliated entities under the developers' control. Mr. Lichtenstein said on Monday the examiner had needlessly expanded the scope of his investigation to run up fees and aid the lender in its efforts to derail the planned restructuring. The developers' plan would force Benefit Street to accept a new, borrower-friendly $70.7 million loan [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/williamsburg-hotel-pushes-for-interest-rate-cut-on-top-lender-11644963960] with lower interest rates than the current mortgage. The lender has said it is owed $95 million including interest and fees and is entitled to a higher coupon on any replacement loan, which the hotel disputes. Lawyers for Benefit Street didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. In court papers, the hotel said that transactions identified in the report as suspect were legitimate payments for covering the hotel's operating or construction expenses, repaying loans owed to third parties or reimbursing business expenditures and short-term loans by the hotel's principals or affiliates. The examiner was provided with ""more than enough information to establish the foregoing,"" according to the owner's filing, which said the report also failed to mention the roughly $21 million in equity and $11 million in loans infused into the hotel. Mr. Lichtenstein separately said the examiner had ignored inflows of money, double-counted certain transfers and erroneously claimed the business had transferred more funds than it had generated from 2017 to 2020, a ""practical impossibility."" Mr. Huebscher has sought court approval to increase the fee cap on his investigation from $350,000 to $850,000, saying the investigation cost more than expected because Ms. Moskovits and Mr. Lichtenstein failed to turn over bank statements, interfered in subpoenas issued to third parties and failed to answer questions about thousands of transactions. The owner asked on Monday to enforce the fee cap, saying the examiner's fees are disproportionate to the size of the bankruptcy case and the result of his arbitrarily expanding the scope of the probe and looking at unrelated bank accounts. Monday's report found the hotel didn't file tax returns from 2017 to 2019, even though about $24.5 million was deposited into its bank accounts from 2017 to 2020. Similarly, about $68 million was deposited into the developer-controlled hotel manager's account, but with the exception of 2019, those deposits weren't reported to any taxing authority, the report said. In response, Mr. Lichtenstein told the examiner that additional tax returns weren't filed because the entities didn't make a profit, according to the report. Mr. Lichtenstein said Monday that the hotel's tax filings have been brought up to date. Ms. Moskovits and Mr. Lichtenstein have proposed injecting $10 million into the hotel under a bankruptcy-exit plan that would retain their equity interests in the business. A court hearing to consider the restructuring has been pushed back to April from March to accommodate mediation talks with Benefit Street.

360,0,Dual-Olympic volunteer logs experience making friendships happen,558 words,China Daily,"The 34-year-old, however, is no stranger to the Olympics. In 2006, when she was 18, she began a degree program at Beijing Forestry University. At the same time, volunteers were being recruited for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games, and she did not hesitate to sign up. ""Although I was in junior high school when Beijing won the bid for the Olympic Games in 2001, I felt a sense of national pride and hoped that I could contribute to the country,"" Ju said. ""The Olympic Games are really close to me, and I am so lucky to have these opportunities."" During the 2008 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games, Ju was a translator for spectators at the field hockey venue. ""All the volunteers were so warm and hospitable. Even fatigue could not dampen our enthusiasm,"" she recalled. At the end of last year, Ju, now an employee of Yanqing's education commission, once again became an Olympic volunteer. With more experience under her belt than a decade ago, Ju now has a deeper understanding of the significance of the Olympics and the role of volunteers. She sees the Games as an opportunity for friendship and unity. ""I just concentrated on completing my translation duties in 2008, but now I realize that the Winter Olympic Games represent an opportunity to promote mutual understanding and friendship between people of different countries,"" she said. ""As volunteers, we have more opportunities to communicate with foreigners. We have come 'together for a shared future'."" It was this realization that inspired her to start her diary. In one entry, Ju said she had learned that some Canadian athletes were huge fans of Bing Dwen Dwen, the Winter Olympics mascot. She researched the mascot's design and back story overnight and was able to share her newfound knowledge with the competitors the next day. ""The first phase of testing events came to an end. Today, I borrowed pencils, erasers and crayons from the hotel reception to draw Bing Dwen Dwen for the Canadian athletes. Worried I might make a mistake, it took me about eight hours to complete. I am satisfied that the drawing conveys kindness and friendship, and I hope the athletes will like it,"" she wrote in her diary on Oct 25. Ju also drew an olive branch above the mascot, which represents peace and friendship. ""I saw smiles and excitement on their faces when they received my gift. At that moment, I realized I had not only performed my duty as an Olympic volunteer but also developed a bridge between the hearts of people speaking different languages,"" she wrote in her diary. Volunteers are dynamic messengers of culture, which means they must invest their feelings and enthusiasm in cultural communication, Ju said.  Xinhua"
518,0,Insurers back in court over Covid payouts,218 words,i,"Zurich, MS Amlin, Liberty Mutual, Allianz and AXA are among those due in court one year after the Supreme Court ruled many insurers had been wrong to deny thousands of companies, battered by the Covid-19 pandemic, business interruption payouts. Insurers have since paid out Â£1.3bn, according to the Financial Conduct Authority. However, the ruling did not cover all policy wordings and, where it deemed claims valid, some companies are now disputing payout levels. Companies and insurers have been at loggerheads over whether business interruption policies provide cover for Covid-related losses since lockdowns in March 2020 shuttered shops, bars and restaurants. Corbin & King, owner of London's Wolseley and Delaunay restaurants, begins a High Court trial on Monday. It is suing AXA for approximately Â£4.5m in a dispute that hinges in part on the scope of ""denial of access"" cover, designed to protect insured venues that are shut by public authorities on health grounds. AXA declined to comment. Corbin & King did not respond to a request for comment."
895,0,Petition calls for IMDA to enforce SMS sender ID pre-registration after OCBC scams,445 words,The Straits Times,"This happened when the bank's customers received SMSes purporting to be from the bank, claiming there were issues with their bank accounts. Victims then clicked on a link that mirrored the OCBC website - but was actually set up by scammers - and were asked to key in their Internet banking account login details. The online petition, started by user Captain Sinkie on Change.org, pointed out that scammers can easily ""abuse"" the lack of a SMS sender ID pre-registration requirement in Singapore. It appealed to IMDA to consider enforcing such a requirement. While most banks use SMS number masking technology, in the case of the OCBC phishing scam, scammers managed to replace the phone number with an alphanumeric ""spoofed header"" or sender ID, which was the name of OCBC. The fake SMSes were also particularly believable as they showed up to customers in the same message threads of older but official OCBC messages. Currently, most countries including Singapore do not mandate pre-registration to send SMS messages with sender IDs. However, some places such as Hong Kong, Armenia and Qatar do require pre-registration to send messages with alphanumeric sender IDs. IMDA has since urged more businesses and banks to participate in a government pilot it has set up in collaboration with Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which enables organisations to register the SMS sender ID headers they wish to protect. Under the Singapore SMS SenderID protection registry pilot that was set up in August 2021, messages will be blocked when there is unauthorised use of protected SMS sender IDs, said IMDA on Monday (Jan 17). It was responding to a forum letter submitted by a member of the public, who called for telcos to be the first line of defence against spoof traffic. ""The success of this measure, however, requires business and organisations such as banks to participate in the pilot, which would include registering the SMS sender IDs they wish to protect, and choosing the approved SMS aggregators that are allowed to send SMSes on the banks' behalf,"" said IMDA.

838,0,Neil Young searching for a heart of gold,276 words,The New Zealand Herald,"A survivor of polio as a child, Young told Spotify it could either have him on its platform or the podcaster Joe Rogan ï¿½?not both. Spotify swiftly responded by opting for Rogan, and expressing a hope to welcome Young back âsoonï¿½? With an estimated 11 million listeners per episode, Rogan clearly held enough clout over Young, who has an estimated less than half that each month. It would have been a no-brainer for Spotify to dust Young off like lint off a shoulder and carry on counting the clicks. Young can afford the stand, having sold half of his publishing rights to the investment fund Hipgnosis last year, netting him about $230 million. But it is still a big step to slap away the largest growing music outlet. Spotifyâs subscriber base has increased dramatically in the last few Covid-ravaged years and has more than doubled since early 2017. Young has history with Spotify, previously removing his songs claiming poor sound quality, but in choosing morality over money, Youngâs move will be music to the ears of fans who have suffered fools such as Eric Clapton and Van Morrison during these troubled times. Perhaps other musicians too will consider there comes a time to contribute more to the collective good than going after the gold rush."

The IOC and host nation Japan are still confident that the Games will go ahead as planned, but no one has any real idea on how long this might go on for. Just from athletes I have spoken to, there is definitely real concern over the Games. The concern isnât just over whether the games get cancelled or not. For each individual athlete, it is also over their own preparations. As an athlete, getting sick is never great and if you got this virus bad you might face missing weeks of training. It could result on you missing the podium in Tokyo.? Or missing the Games altogether. Another friend of mine told me of his concerns that if they move the Games then he might not even get selected.? With markets crashing and supermarket shelves being cleared, these are definitely interesting times for everybody. But when you are living during this Covid-19 pandemic with a spinal-cord injury I guess it becomes even more daunting ï¿½?as such an injury can remove your cough and sneeze reflex. With very little core function, the thought of not being able to cough is a pretty scary proposition.? This might not sound too bad. But this virus hits elderly people hard ï¿½?and this also includes your biological age due to underlying medical conditions. So this is a scary time, and I completely feel for everyone in the same boat as me how scary this is.?I remember back to catching the flu in November last year ï¿½?I thought I was going to stop breathing. I couldnât cough to clear my lungs as the level of my injury is right at the nerves which go to the lungs.? It knocked me out for weeks, so I would be lying if I said I wasnât slightly scared of Covid-19 and its possible effects on my lungs.? I am a very optimistic person who always looks for solutions over problems. But I must admit this has got me a little bit shaken.? Watching whatâs happening in Italy has been hard to believe ï¿½?particularly as life seemed to be continuing almost as normal here.? I looked at the MRI of a 44-year-old manâs lungs and it was unbelievable, unfortunately he didnât survive.? So I am staying positive but also taking advice from Austrian neurologist Viktor Frankl.?He speaks of acceptance of your current situation. These are his own words ï¿½?which I have had on my wall for the last four years: âThe meaning of life lies in finding a purpose and taking responsibility for ourselves and other human beings.ï¿½? In other words, by having a clear âwhyï¿½?we can face all the âhowï¿½?questions of life. This has got me through all those hours in hospital and continues to serve me daily.? Thereâs a reason that in-flight safety presentations always instruct us to secure our own oxygen masks before assisting fellow passengers. We canât help others effectively unless we first protect ourselves. So I spoke with a medical oncologist friend and they advised me to self-isolate.? I am now on day four and thinking this could be a long road ahead; thankfully the weather is getting warmer and I got out on my bike for a few laps of Richmond Park. Along with indoor turbo sessions I am well prepared mentally for the process. I guess all my time in hospital equipped my mind to deal with self-isolating. It also probably helps being an introvert.? I canât help but think of the poor people undergoing their cancer treatment right now though, as I prepare for my own hospital appointment in a few weeks, but I am grateful that side of things is under control. My main goal is keeping my immune system strong because another issue I have from my spinal-cord injury is a compromised immune system, thus moving me into a vulnerable group.? Itâs hard to go from a strong athlete to now feeling so vulnerable, but thankfully I have a strong mind."

20,1,"NATIONALLY RANKED ROSEN LAW FIRM Encourages C3.ai, Inc. Investors with Losses Over $100K to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - AI",824 words,Media OutReach Newswire,"WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the C3.ai class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=3839[https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/e4GpVUevW4] or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com[mailto:pkim@rosenlegal.com] or cases@rosenlegal.com[mailto:cases@rosenlegal.com] for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than May 3, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, the Offering Documents were negligently prepared and, as a result, contained untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading and were not prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations governing their preparation. Additionally, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding C3.ai's business, operations, and compliance policies. Specifically, the Offering Documents and defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) C3.ai's partnership with Baker Hughes was deteriorating; (2) C3.ai's was employing a flawed accounting methodology to conceal the deterioration of its Baker Hughes partnership; (3) C3.ai faced challenges in product adoption and significant salesforce turnover; (4) C3.ai overstated, inter alia, the extent of its investment in technology, description of its customers, its total addressable market, the pace of its market growth, and the scale of alliances with its major business partners; and (5) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the C3.ai class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=3839[https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/8AxzYsQjgG] or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com[mailto:pkim@rosenlegal.com] or cases@rosenlegal.com[mailto:cases@rosenlegal.com] for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

694,0,Trump Family Ally Ken Kurson Pleads Guilty in New York Cybercrime Case; Former Observer editor had been pardoned by Trump on federal charges,482 words,The Wall Street Journal Online,"A lawyer for Mr. Kurson didn't respond to a request for comment. Last year, the Manhattan district attorney's office charged Mr. Kurson with illegally accessing communications of his then wife[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/trump-ally-ken-kurson-charged-with-cybercrimes-in-new-york-11629315187] while at the Observer offices. Mr. Kurson used spyware to monitor his wife's keystrokes, obtained her passwords and accessed her Facebook and Gmail accounts, prosecutors said. Mr. Kurson's plea to the state crimes comes after similar federal charges and a subsequent pardon by Mr. Trump. Mr. Kurson had long been a member of Mr. Trump's circle, having once been the editor in chief of the Observer, the newspaper that was published by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law. Mr. Kurson also served as an adviser to Rudy Giuliani's 2008 presidential campaign. In October 2020, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn charged Mr. Kurson with cyberstalking crimes, alleging he used multiple aliases to file complaints about two victims with their employer and posted false negative reviews on Yelp about a third victim. He pleaded not guilty. Mr. Trump pardoned Mr. Kurson several months later while the case was pending. In issuing the pardon, the White House said the federal investigation began only because Mr. Kurson had been nominated to a role within the Trump administration. Mr. Kurson is the third person pardoned by Mr. Trump known to face separate scrutiny from the Manhattan district attorney's office. In March 2019, Manhattan prosecutors charged former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort with residential mortgage fraud. A state court judge dismissed that case[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/new-york-judge-tosses-new-york-state-case-against-paul-manafort-11576683392]. The office also has a continuing investigation into former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, according to people familiar with the matter. The investigation is examining conduct similar to a federal case in which prosecutors accused Mr. Bannon and several associates[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/former-senior-trump-advisor-steve-bannon-charged-with-alleged-fundraising-scheme-11597931727] of stealing from hundreds of thousands of people who donated to a private effortâthe We Build the Wall campaignâto crowdfund a border wall.

860,0,Neil Young Demands Spotify Remove His Music -- 3rd Update,918 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"Mr. Young didn't respond to requests for comment.

""With an estimated 11 million listeners per episode, JRE, which is hosted exclusively on Spotify, is the world's largest podcast and has tremendous influence. Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform,"" Mr. Young wrote in the letter. ""I want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform...They can have Rogan or Young. Not both."" While Mr. Young's label, Warner Music Group Corp.'s Warner Records, is the licensor to Spotify and may legally have control over how and where his music is distributed, it is typical for a record company to take an artist's wishes into account. An act of Mr. Young's cachet in particular tends to have more control over their career and creative output. The label was in discussions with Mr. Young over the matter Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter. If a decision is reached to remove the music, Spotify could take it down in a matter of hours, this person said. Mr. Young's letter cited an episode of the podcast in which Mr. Rogan spoke with Dr. Robert Malone, a virologist who worked on research into several mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, but who is now critical of the treatments. Among the claims made was the suggestion that hospitals have been financially motivated to falsely diagnose deaths as having been caused by Covid-19. Mr. Rogan has regularly used his podcast to discuss Covid-19 vaccines and restrictions, railing against vaccine mandates for indoor events and suggesting that young, healthy people shouldn't be vaccinated. Spotify's bet on Mr. Rogan's show has caused trouble in the past for the audiostreaming company. Some employees expressed concern over the podcast's content during a town-hall meeting in September 2020, relating to material they felt was anti-transgender, according to people familiar with the matter. The company stood by its star podcaster, with Chief Executive Daniel Ek saying that the ambition to make Spotify the ""largest audio platform in the world"" involves embracing diverse voices and differing opinions as the company chases scale in podcasting. ""The most important thing for us is to have very clear policies in place, "" he said in an interview a month after the town hall. ""It doesn't matter if you're Joe Rogan or anyone else, we do apply those policies and they need to be evenly applied."" Earlier this month, a group of 270 scientists and healthcare professionals signed an open letter to Spotify accusing the podcast of ""promoting baseless conspiracy theories"" and asking the service to take action against mass-misinformation events on its platform. ""Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Joe Rogan has repeatedly spread misleading and false claims on his podcast, provoking distrust in science and medicine,"" it said. Since the start of the pandemic, Spotify has removed over 20,000 Covid-related podcast episodes as a result of creators violating its policies, according to a person familiar with the matter. While over 40 of Mr. Rogan's episodes have been removed, none of them have been related to the pandemic, this person said. Mr. Young also launched his own streaming service in 2018 called the ""Neil Young Archives"" which offers different yearly subscriptions ranging from $19.99 to $99.99 to access the artist's albums. Mr. Young has previously had issues with streaming platforms. In 2015, he said he didn't need his content ""to be devalued by the worst quality in the history of broadcasting or any other form of distribution"" and that he was pulling his music from streaming services. The artist's music returned to Spotify in 2016. ""That's where people get music,"" he later told Rolling Stone. Monday's letter wasn't the first time the outspoken 76-year-old has used his website to take on big companies in the music business. Last summer, Mr. Young criticized concert promoters in a post, calling live shows super-spreader events and wondering why more artists weren't canceling shows. -- Allison Prang contributed to this article.

957,1,Private sector expects to improve sales and then evaluate prices,783 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"When asked by ÃH if they will analyze whether they will match their prices to those of Petropar, taking into account that they still have better prices with the increase, the manager of Copetrol, Jorge CÃ¡ceres, said yesterday that although the state-owned company was lower in prices, it is an issue that they have not yet analyzed nor have they made any determination, ""They (Petropar) were lower, but we have not yet made any determination at this precise moment, neither in Copetrol nor in Petrobras,"" he said. He stated that they do not know if there could be any price modification and that they would only be analyzing it next week. He pointed out that although Petropar now has 500 guaranÃ­es cheaper for regular diesel, it is not the same as the difference of G. 2,500 that it had been having. He indicated that now the situation is better and it will be necessary to wait for the behavior of sales and the reaction of the final consumer, which is what is really important. Other private sector referents consulted indicated that now they expect to increase again the volume of sales which was almost nil during the subsidy for Petropar. empty. On the other hand, the panorama in Petropar's service stations changed radically since yesterday with the price readjustment. The service stations of the state-owned company remained with lines of vehicles to fill up while the subsidy lasted. On Tuesday night, the last day before the readjustment, all stations were crowded with vehicles. After the increase, yesterday, the number of people at the gas stations returned to normal. In a tour, little movement of vehicles was observed. Likewise, there was no major movement in the stations of the different emblems of the private sector, possibly due to the fact that most of them have already loaded their fuels for the use in these days of celebration of the Holy Week. In terms of convenience, even with the increase, Petropar continues to have lower prices for all fuels than its competitors in the market. In the case of common diesel, it maintains a difference of less than 500 guaranÃ­es, while in the case of 93 octane intermediate naphtha it is 400 guaranÃ­es less. Figures 8,050 guaranÃ­es is the new price per liter of gasoil type III (common) of the state-owned fuel company Petropar. 8,550 is the price per liter of common diesel in all private emblems, that is, G. 500 more expensive than that of Petropar. 8,310 is the retail price of Petropar's 93 octane naphtha, after the readjustment that took effect yesterday. 8,710 is the average retail price of 93 octane naphtha in the private sector, G. 400 more expensive than Petropar. 9,590 is the price per liter of super naphtha of 97 octane sold by Petropar, after the readjustment made yesterday. 9,840 is the price per liter of super naphtha of 97 octane at private emblems, G. 250 more expensive than that of Petropar. Suspension of the contribution to the Treasury While mentioning that at no time was Petropar at risk of running out of supplies, its owner, Denis Lichi, presented the argumentation regarding the moderate readjustment of prices, which made it possible to arrive at figures for the final consumer without the company losing, but trying not to reach the levels of increase set by the private companies. Petropar supported in this way, besides the suspension of the intergovernmental contribution of USD 20 million that the oil company must pass on to the Treasury, the possibility of setting prices to the public at values of G. 500 per liter below the private emblems for diesel type 3, and G. 400 less for Oikoite naphtha; as he explained in a press conference, when the new prices of the oil company were announced."
134,0,The Court of Master Sommeliers aims to restore its reputation after being plagued by scandals,906 words,Washington Post.com,"It was a spectacular implosion for an organization that skyrocketed to fame over the previous decade on the coattails of a booming restaurant trade and consumer fascination with wine. The ""Somm"" series of movies portrayed the dedication and professionalism required to pursue the coveted red lapel pin of the master sommelier, the profession's highest rank. The films also showed the sacrifices and, to some extent, the recklessness inherent in a professional pursuit centered on the consumption of alcohol. A cheating scandal in 2018 tarnished the court's image, and the triple blows of 2020 brought it to the precipice of irrelevance. A lot of money was at stake. Master somms are rare. There are only 172 in the Court of Master Sommeliers, Americas, out of 269 worldwide. Once they attain their lapel pins, few continue to work the restaurant floor. They typically move on to corporate positions, managing a restaurant group's beverage program, working with importers or distributors, even wineries. That's not to say they leave the profession ï¿½?they often do wine education and training for restaurant staff, and they teach the court's certification courses and proctor its exams. (Which loops back to the sexual harassment scandal.) If the court were to lose its stature and prestige, the pin would lose its Midas touch. So in late 2020, the Americas chapter board of directors resigned en masse and members elected a new board, led by two women. (Of the 172 master somms in the chapter, 28 are women.) The new board hired a professional ethicist to revamp its code of ethics, contracted with a firm specializing in workplace harassment issues to transform its organizational culture, and hired a third-party investigator to look into the harassment claims. That investigation culminated in November when the court expelled six members, including Fred Dame, who cofounded the Americas chapter and helped build the organization in the United States. ""We faced a lot of criticism, but when the previous board entirely stepped down, that allowed us to say everything was on the table,"" said Emily Wines, the appropriately named chair of the new board of directors. Wines earned her pin in 2008 and is vice president of the beverage program for the Cooper's Hawk Winery restaurant chain. To make the organization more professional, the board hired an executive director to handle day-to-day operations. They chose Julie Cohen Theobald, who brought more than two decades of experience as a brand manager for Procter & Gamble, as well as work in the nonprofit sector. Theobald had no experience in the wine or service industry, but she liked the challenge of addressing the court's scandals. ""There are few opportunities in life to make an impact on gender and diversity issues,"" Theobald said in a recent interview. ""We may be a small organization, but we have a degree of influence on the industry and maybe even society."" Since Theobald joined the court last autumn, the board added four new members from outside the wine industry. They brought expertise in human resources, credentialing, hospitality and diversity. The goal is to move to a ""classic nonprofit structure"" that will have lasting change to ripple through the wine service sector, she said. Diversity is key to that change. ""It's a male-dominated industry, so we want to make sure it's a safe space and give women a way to report problems instead of just silently walking away,"" Wines said. To that end, the court established an independent hotline for harassment complaints. It also took steps to improve racial diversity. ""We can't just say our programs are open; we have to look at who's coming to the door in the first place,"" Wines said. ""So we created 100 scholarships for people of color, women and people in need to take our introductory program."" Because of the coronavirus pandemic, that program is now online, which eliminates travel costs for candidates to take the exams in big cities. The new board is also moving away from the celebrity somm to emphasize professionalism. ""It's a service industry and a trade, so we don't want to elevate sommeliers as superstars, but elevate the profession,"" Wines said. ""Especially after covid, the profession has changed a lot, and we need to change with it. When restaurants hit hard times, sommeliers are often the first to be cut. We want to emphasize not just wine knowledge, but how to run a beverage program and a restaurant.""

974,1,Global Rail Asset Management Market Report 2022: Growing Need for Advanced Transportation Infrastructure Driving Rail Asset Management Market Growth - ResearchAndMarkets.com,845 words,Business Wire,"The global rail asset management market size is expected to grow from USD 10.1 billion in 2021 to USD 13.2 billion by 2026, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.6% during the forecast period. The rail industry plays a vital role in shaping the economic and financial position of a country. It carries billions of passengers and freights daily and generates huge revenues. Due to the ease and comfort in transportation, the dependence on railways for both passengers and goods is rising at a rapid pace. A majority of countries are investing heavily in rail infrastructure to provide a seamless experience to their citizens through railways. Railways also help governments minimize the cost of transfer of passengers as well as goods, considering the huge carrying capacity it offers in a single run. The growing dependence on railways is increasing the pressure on the existing rail infrastructure. This leads to several uncalled and unscheduled maintenance for both rolling stock and infrastructure, owing to wear and tear of systems, breakdowns, damages, and repair needs. By deployment mode, the on-premises segment is expected to record at the largest market size during the forecast period. The on-premises deployment mode refers to the installation of software and solutions in the premises of the organization. In this deployment mode, the organization is responsible for maintaining the solution and all its related processes. These solutions are delivered on a one-time license fee and an annual service agreement, which includes a free modification or upgrade and installation of new functionalities. The on-premises deployment of rail asset management solutions requires dedicated infrastructure and servers. It also requires dedicated IT staff for the maintenance and support of the high-end IT infrastructure. Organizations that can afford to manage dedicated servers usually deploy on-premises solutions. The on-premises deployment mode also offers offline data analytics and configuration and provides better control over systems and data. The rolling stock segment is expected to hold the largest market size. The railway is an asset-intensive industry, and rolling stock is one of the most important asset categories in the railway industry. Efficiently managing rolling stock can save a significant amount of resources for the rail operator. Rolling stocks usually have a long service life, hence keeping a vehicle in operation for such a long period of time can create various servicing challenges, such as securing parts, unplanned maintenance etc. Asset management solutions for rolling stocks can provide better control over asset performance, more efficient use of resources, and more effective risk management. Many rail operators are investing in rolling stock.

346,1,Employment Practices Liability & Cyber Liability ï¿½?Insurance Policies Not To Neglect,626 words,Mondaq Business Briefing,"Employment Practices Liability Insurance As employment practices liability insurance started gaining prominence over a decade ago, with some companies understanding and appreciating the importance of the coverage, there were some that expressed hesitancy to purchase the coverage, struggling and failing to understand the need for it. Fast forward to today and one would be hard-pressed to find a company operating without such coverage. The arrival of the #metoo movement and the attention it placed on workplace behavior ushered in a new era of understanding ï¿½?appreciating the significance and need for such insurance coverage. Cyber Liability Insurance A similar evolutionary process (though not from a moral equivalency perspective) has been unfolding in the insurance industry with cyber liability insurance. As it emerged in the industry, there was significant hesitancy in exploring the coverage, let alone purchasing it. Initially, companies refused to acknowledge the importance of the coverage. Even as large cyber events took place, most businesses failed to realize that they were targets, incorrectly believing that only ""brand name"" companies were targets of the deleterious designs of cyber criminals. Over time, it has become apparent that smaller and lesser name companies are actually greater targets of cyberattacks. Due to a lackadaisical approach and weaker attempts at cybersecurity, smaller companies are easier targets and ultimately more often the victims of cyberattacks. Given multiple sources of data supporting this notion and indicating that anywhere from 50% to two thirds of small businesses have suffered at least one cyberattack, along with greater education and awareness, it is now rare to encounter a company that is not, at the very least, interested in exploring the coverage, if they haven't already purchased it. It is important to be aware of the key points for these two lines of coverage to better understand the potential exposures to risk and how to address it with insurance. Employment Practices LiabilitySome of the standard coverages include:Cyber LiabilityCoverages can vary significantly by carrier, but the followingare some of the coverages that can be afforded: What Businesses Can Do Now Due to the variety of different forms and the amount of carriers competing in this space, multiple quotes should be obtained and compared in order to achieve best pricing and to better understand the coverages available. It would be prudent to review the coverage with an insurance broker or consultant that is well-versed in cyber liability coverage to ensure the right coverage is put in place. Because there are no standard forms, carriers are more flexible when negotiating terms and coverage, and unique exposures can be addressed without the typical roadblocks one would encounter when trying to negotiate terms with other insurance policies.

268,0,"Californiaâs victim compensation doled out $6m less in 2020, revealing gaps in crucial program",1087 words,The Guardian,"The rise in homicide compensations reflects the stark uptick [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/27/us-murder-rate-increase-2020] in gun violence during the pandemic, a rise whose impact has been most [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/28/san-francisco-bay-area-gun-violence-murders-2020] acutely felt by Black and Latino Americans. But the decline in overall payments renews questions about gaps in the program that advocates say make it difficult for those in need to collect compensation. Californiaâs victim compensation board (CalVCB) paid out more than $52m between 1 July 2020 and 30 June 2021 to crime victims in the state, according to the agencyâs annual reports. The vast majority of the money allotted, over $40m, was paid out to victims of assault, homicide and child abuse. Payments to family members of murder victims rose by $2m compared with the year before, data shows. But compensation to victims of other types of crimes declined across the board. The program saw a sharp decline in applications for compensation,data indicates, with 40,600 claims submitted, 10,000 fewer than the year before. The board also denied 900 more applications in 2020 than 2019, according to CalVCBâs statistics [https://victims.ca.gov/uploads/2021/10/Annual-Report-Supp-Stats-20-21.pdf]. Heather Jones, a representative for the board, pointed to the pandemic hampering their outreach efforts as the reason behind the drop in applications in a statement to the Guardian. But even before the pandemic, officials and advocates argued CalVCB was in need of reform. A recent memo [http://www.clrc.ca.gov//CRPC/Pub/Memos/CRPC22-02.pdf] by Californiaâs state committee on revision of the penal code, a state group formed in 2020 to comb through Californiaâs legal system and recommend changes that would improve equity and efficiency, highlighted some of the longstanding shortcomings of the program. California created its victim compensation program in 1965, the first state to do so in the US. The program is mainly funded by restitution ï¿½?money someone is ordered to pay after being convicted of a crime ï¿½?and is used to help victims pay for funerals, medical bills and income loss if they take time off work. A reimbursement is only granted once someone exhausts payments from sources like workersï¿½?compensation benefits or a civil lawsuit settlement. If someone proves that they donât have any insurance or way to pay for a funeral or hospital stay, they may qualify for an upfront emergency payment. Often we find that people donât have life insurance, theyâre falling below the poverty line. Finances can add another traumatic layer to the scenario Jasmine Hardison But among the requirements to receive compensation is cooperation with police, a non-starter for some families living in communities [https://giffords.org/press-release/2020/01/in-pursuit-of-peace/] that are most affected by both gun violence and over-policing and mass incarceration. Families of victims also canât claim compensation if the victim, according to police, was involved in the crime or had gang ties. Advocates argue that such conditions make claims over-dependent on police officersï¿½?account of an incident. And while applicants can appeal a denial, they have to come up with their own evidence that can prove their cooperation with police and that their loved one was not responsible for their own slaying. In Alameda county, where Oakland is located, a 2020 grand jury [http://grandjury.acgov.org/grandjury-assets/docs/2020-2021/Racial%20Disparities.pdf] investigation found that Black applicants were more than twice as likely to be denied for non-cooperation than white victims. Red tape and lack of outreach not only puts an additional strain on grieving families, it can also keep the cycle of violence going, said Jasmine Hardison, coordinator of the Khadafy Washington Project [https://www.youthalive.org/khadafy-washington-project/], a homicide response program through Oaklandâs Youth Alive!, a non-profit violence prevention and youth development organization. Support funds can make a massive difference in the lives of victims and their families, Hardison said. âPeople who are on the lower side of the socioeconomic scale have to rely on these resources to pay for hospital expenses,ï¿½?she said. âOften we find that people donât have life insurance, theyâre in subsidized housing and they may be working full time, but theyâre still falling below the poverty line. Finances can add another traumatic layer to the scenario,ï¿½?she explained. In 2021, the average cost of a funeral [https://nfda.org/news/media-center/nfda-news-releases/id/6182/2021-nfda-general-price-list-study-shows-funeral-costs-not-rising-as-fast-as-rate-of-inflation] in the US was more than $7,800, about $500 higher than it was five years ago, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. And if the person survives [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/gun-violence-survivors-oakland-bay-area] their gunshot wounds, they and their families have to shoulder potentially tens of thousands of dollars in surgeries, physical therapy and home renovations if someoneâs mobility is impaired by their injuries. At the same time, the pandemic has exacerbated unemployment and housing insecurity, factors that drive gun violence among lower-income Black and Latino residents and add layers of stress on to already fragile communities. By the time the stateâs 2020 fiscal year began in July, the loss of schools, jobs and youth centers was being felt by lower income Black and Latino residents and reflected in a gradual increase in killings that would last through 2021 in cities like Oakland and Los Angeles. Hardisonâs own son, 21-year-old David McDaniel, was shot and killed in 2016. Through support from the Khadafy Washington Project she was able to get victim compensation and long term services to help her deal with the trauma, support she said was vital since she was unable to work for two years after her son was killed. She took up her new role in late 2020, collecting victimsï¿½?belongings from police, picking out caskets and walking families through the victim compensation process. About half the people she meets arenât aware of the stateâs victimâs compensation, Hardison said, and those who do know before meeting her find out from neighbors who have also been affected by violence. âMore hurt people will hurt people,ï¿½?Hardison said about the decline in payouts. âThereâs still this stigma about who is and isnât a victim, and families have to suffer because of that,ï¿½?she said."
250,0,'Ocean State': Early reveal doesn't pay off,935 words,The Washington Post,"He has now done the opposite: His new novel, ""Ocean State,"" makes a murder mystery as compelling as the closing of a Red Lobster restaurant. It's a curious but apparently intentional achievement in a book that feels allergic to its own suspense. ""Ocean State"" opens with this shocking line: ""When I was in eighth grade my sister helped kill another girl."" Even with the killer's identity revealed, much remains tantalizingly hidden but only for a few pages. The full horror of the crime is soon revealed: The victim was a popular high school student. The two girls were fighting over a boy. Disclosing these material details before the crime is reenacted in the novel, before the police investigation uncovers the truth and before the trial produces a verdict, O'Nan has purposefully drained the tension from this tragedy. What's left for us in ""Ocean State"" are doleful reflections on various characters' motives and reactions. It's a gamble. The novel's first narrator, Marie, introduces us to her poor family in Rhode Island. Her pretty sister, the teenage murderer, goes by the exceedingly ironic name ""Angel."" Their mother is a nurse's aide with one talent: ""finding new boyfriends."" That ensures a precarious life for the family. ""My mother's boyfriends tried to be sweet, but they were strangers,"" Marie says in her poignant, retrospective voice. ""Sometimes they paid our rent and sometimes we split it. When they broke up with my mother - suddenly, drunkenly, their shouting jerking us from sleep - we would have to move again. Like her, we were always rooting for things to work out, far beyond where we should have."" As usual, O'Nan writes about financially stressed people with a clear and empathetic sense of the constant pressures they endure. Their plight is well represented by Marie and Angel's 42-year-old mother. When she discovers that the latest man she's dating lives in ""an active adult community"" - that is, a retirement home - she feels humiliated but also excited by the chance for stability. ""Is it wrong to want something better than where they are?"" she wonders. ""It's not like she could ever afford it herself. How many chances like this will she get?"" Perhaps if she hadn't been so focused on manufacturing a romance with her geriatric beau, she might have noticed what her daughter Angel was up to. But maybe not. As Marie notes, ""My sister seemed to move through an underworld of secrets, the hidden currents of desire."" Indeed, that underworld of clandestine teenage desire is the ostensible subject of ""Ocean State."" O'Nan spends much of the novel shuttling between Angel and her nemesis, Birdy Alves. They're both sleeping with Myles, a good-looking senior from a wealthy family. He's savvy enough to try to keep his relationship with Birdy on the down-low, but when photos of them sneaking around slip out on social media, their classmates turn sharply against her. And then Angel lashes out. High school girls fighting over and even killing for the affections of a boy make this an inherently gripping plot. But O'Nan's approach is - pardon the word - deadly. Two-thirds of the novel are spent chronicling teenage angst and school-hall drama without the verve necessary to make this story pump with authentic adolescent energy. O'Nan's careful, sepia-toned observations offer no satirical wit on the machinations of horny teenagers nor any chilling insight on the horrors that sexual desire can activate. Instead, we get a lot of passages like this: ""Myles hangs out front between the pillars with Ryan and his crew. Birdy knows his schedule by heart, smiles to herself each time she passes his locker. All morning, sitting in class, watching the rain fall on the tennis courts and the soccer field, she pictures their room at the beach, but then, after lunch, he texts to let her know he has to cancel. No explanation, just sry."" Such generalized prose relies on us already knowing how Ryan and his cocky crew pose with studied nonchalance, how pandemonium breaks out in the hall of lockers between classes, and especially how a savvy girl suspends the knowledge that the object of her devotion is a cad. At this late date, after so many comedies, dramas, mysteries and thrillers about high school romances, double-dealing jocks, vicious mean girls and toxic social media platforms, we're deeply familiar with the tropes of the genre. But for that very reason, we don't particularly need a novel that feels so unwilling to tell us something we haven't already heard. Even the act of murder itself is politely obscured in these pages, and the trial that takes place late in the story does so largely offstage. More than a decade ago, O'Nan published ""Songs for the Missing,"" a devastating story about parents crushed by the endless search for their 18-year-old daughter. No one who read that relentlessly static tragedy will ever forget it. But this new novel, about the loss of another teenage girl under circumstances that are so much more dramatic, leaves little impact at all. Sry.

172,0,McDonald's to shut down in Russia,978 words,The Daily Telegraph,"MCDONALD'S , Starbucks and Coca- Cola are shutting operations in Russia as a new iron curtain descends between Moscow and the West.  McDonald's said it was temporarily closing 850 outlets because it ""cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine"", while Starbucks is both shuttering cafes and suspending shipments.  Pepsico , a fellow poster-boy for capitalism which introduced cola to the Soviet Union, is also reportedly considering options for its Russian unit, including writing off the entire value of the division. It comes after Britain, the US and the European Union set out plans to ditch Russian oil and gas in a move which President Joe Biden said was aimed at ""targeting the main artery of Russia's economy"". President Biden added: ""Americans have rallied to support the Ukrainian people and made it clear we will not be part of subsidising Putin's war.""  McDonald's opened its first restaurant in Moscow in 1990, attracting queues of an estimated 30,000 people in Pushkin Square in what came to be seen as a defining moment for the triumph of capitalism after the Cold War. The company's success gave rise to Thomas Friedman's Golden Arches theory, in which he suggested that con sumerism was a force for peace because no two countries that both had the chain's restaurants had ever fought a war against each other.  Chris Kempczinski , the chief executive of McDonald's , wrote to employees to say the business was facing an ""extraordinarily challenging"" situation.  McDonald's employs 62,000 people in Russia, works with hundreds of local suppliers and serves millions of customers every day. Around 9pc of the business's revenues come from Russia and Ukraine, equal to about $2bn (Â£1.5bn). However, Mr Kempczinski said it was a case of ""doing the right thing"", and so McDonald's was pausing all operations in Russia. He said: ""The conflict in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis in Europe has caused unspeakable suffering to innocent people We join the world in condemning aggression and violence and praying for peace.""  Clive Black , a director at Shore Capital , said the closure would likely bring the impact of sanctions home to ordinary Russians. He said: ""It's one thing when there are external things happening around banking and oil, but it's another thing when 850 restaurants close down. It's a very clear symbol that something is changing which is quite material. ""In isolation, it wouldn't necessarily be the end of the world, but we saw how popular McDonald's was in the UK when Covid controls ended, and I'd imagine it was the same in Russia. ""This is a very big statement, and along with everything else will turn up the pressure [among the public] that what's going on isn't normal and maybe the narrative needs to be questioned.""  McDonald's said it will continue to pay all its employees in Russia, despite the restaurants being shut. It is impossible to predict when they will reopen, the business said. McDonald's will assess the situation to decide whether more measures are needed. The step follows a mounting public backlash against the brand, with customers over the weekend vowing to boycott the chain if it continued to sell in Russia. It came as Kwasi Kwarteng , the Business Secretary, announced that Britain would ban Russian oil imports by the end of 2022, and President Joe Biden signed an executive order blocking imports of Russian oil, coal and gas. Moments before their announcements, the European Commission published plans to try to cut EU demand for Russian gas by two thirds before the end of the year, and make Europe ""independent from Russian fossil fuels well before 2030"". An exodus of Western companies has been gathering pace since Russia Continued on Page 3 Ben Marlow: Page 4 Companies under pressure: Page 5 Continued from Page 1 invaded Ukraine last month. Shell announced yesterday that it would stop trading Russian oil and shut its 400 service stations in the country, while the publisher CondÃ© Nast, which owns magazines such as Vogue and GQ, said it would be suspending operations. The London-listed consumer goods giant Unilever has also faced pressure to pull out, but said yesterday it would continue to sell items in the country, supplying Russian citizens with ""everyday essential food and hygiene products"" that have been made there. This is understood to cover items such as soup and soap.  Unilever said the policy would remain under close review.  Alan Jope , chief executive, said that Unilever would not make any profit from Russian sales and would not be investing any further capital into the country. He added: ""We have suspended all imports and exports of our products into and out of Russia, and we will stop all media and advertising spend. ""We continue to condemn the war in Ukraine as a brutal and senseless act by the Russian state."" Other US fast food chains are also facing demands to shut down in the country, including Burger King , KFC and Starbucks . Yum brands, the owner of KFC , said it was pausing investment. However, McDonald's owns many of its restaurants in Russia, unlike many of its rivals, where stores are owned by franchisees in the country. McDonald's owns around 84pc of its Russian restaurants. McDonald's said it has also closed its 100 restaurants in Ukraine, and is continuing to pay those workers as well. 'It's a very clear symbol that something is changing which is quite material' 84pc Of McDonald's restaurants in Russia are owned by the company, unlike many of its rivals who operate with franchisees"

998,1,Vietnamese mining company seeks to expand alumina production by a fourth,239 words,Vietnam News Summary,"If it gets the green light, the output of alumina, which is made from bauxite and is used as a starting material for the smelting of aluminum metal, at the complexes will rise by 150,000 tons a year. The two mines have reserves of around 260 million tons, according to Vinacomin. They have broken even years earlier than planned on surging global aluminum prices. The Tan Rai complex, for instance, posted profits of VND379 billion ($16.6 million) in 2017 and almost quintupled that a year later to VND1.8 trillion. Vinacomin also sought the governmentâs approval for its 2021-30 plans, which would serve as a basis for it to begin new bauxite projects in the Central Highlands. Vietnam has the worldâs third largest bauxite reserves of 3.7 billion tonnes, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The majority of them are in the Central Highlands and have only been minimally mined. (E.vnexpress.net ï¿½?April 14)"

504,1,High Gasoline Prices Take Up Big Share of March Retail Spending Increase; Sales rose 0.5% as consumers spend more on essentials like gasoline and food,1005 words,The Wall Street Journal Online,"Declines in online shopping and auto sales also held back spending totals. Overall retail sales would have been even higher if not for a 1.9% monthly auto sales decline. Auto companies struggled with a vehicle shortage during the pandemic due to supply disruptions, pushing prices up sharply. Sales also declined at online retailers, a 6.4% drop over February. Spending rose for a range of other categories, including appliances, electronics, groceries, dining out and clothing. But gains only outpaced inflation in three categories: sporting goods, electronics, and general merchandise, according to Tim Quinlan, senior economist at Wells Fargo. Retail sales aren't adjusted for inflation; on an adjusted basis, retail sales fell by 0.7% last month, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and economist estimates. Annual consumer inflation surged[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/us-inflation-consumer-price-index-march-2022-11649725215] to a new four-decade high of 8.5% in March from the same month a year ago, the Labor Department said Tuesday. Inflation-fueled prices may prompt consumers to think outside the pandemic mind-set, according to WSJ's Heard on the Street[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/spending-more-getting-less-as-inflation-outpaces-retail-sales-11649953605]  Rising costs, especially for gasoline, are likely leading to changes in consumers' behavior[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/spending-more-getting-less-as-inflation-outpaces-retail-sales-11649953605] to cushion the impact on their budgets. While gasoline prices rose at 18.3% in March over February, the increase in sales was less than half of that. ""The fact that prices themselves were up roughly 20% in the month shows that consumers are combining trips or working from home to not spend as much time in the car,"" Mr. Quinlan said. Consumers have moved away from some pandemic-era spending habits, shifting more spending to services[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/consumers-are-pivoting-spending-to-services-like-dining-and-travel-11643797808] and away from physical goods. Higher prices have also decreased demand for some discretionary purchases, such as furniture, which saw a modest rise in sales in March that didn't keep up with inflation. Households instead are spending more on staples such as food, gasoline and utilities, economists said. They also are returning to shop in physical stores rather than online as the surge from the Omicron variant has faded, with sales at nonstore retailers declining for three of the last four months. Despite higher prices, consumers have shown a willingness to spend on activities that were limited earlier in the pandemic. Airlines are reporting strong demand for leisure travel[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/airlines-say-fliers-are-flocking-back-despite-higher-ticket-prices-11647353632], and local economies that are dependent on tourism have been buoyed by the return of out-of-towners. Juan's Flying Burrito, a New Orleans-based restaurant group with five locations, has seen a 60% increase in sales over last year and is nearing prepandemic levels of business, one of its owners said. The return of tourists for Mardi Gras and New Orleans' role as host for this month's college basketball Final Four tournament have juiced sales. They are expecting another bump when the city hosts two big music festivals this spring, including its famous Jazz and Heritage Festival, after the pandemic forced multiple cancellations of the events. ""Since Covid started receding and the city started loosening restrictions with these big events, sales have definitely ticked up,"" co-owner Jay Morris said. Still, shortages and skyrocketing prices for key ingredients mean the restaurant chain still faces challenges. It is paying $100 per case of limes, which is more than five times what they previously cost, Mr. Morris said, and avocado prices are up strongly, too. ""It's really hard to not have those in a Mexican-concept restaurant,"" he said.  Gasoline prices[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/why-is-gasoline-still-so-expensive-if-oil-prices-have-dropped-11649806976], along with broader inflation, have taken a toll on consumer confidence. Public expectations for the level of inflation a year from now hit a record in March, according to a survey[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/new-york-fed-public-expectations-for-march-2023-inflation-hit-6-6-record-11649689597] released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The bank said respondents think that inflation is likely to stay elevated in the medium-term, rather than resolving over the next several months. Those expectations have risen as the pace of inflation has reached a rate last seen 40 years ago. The survey found that expectations for food and gasoline prices increased last month relative to February. ""People have an outsized view of gas prices on their overall economic health, but they're also a core material for many other products,"" said Jonathan Silver, chief executive of Affinity Solutions, a consumer-data firm. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS In what ways have you adjusted your spending because of inflation? Join the conversation below. Some retailers say they are still struggling to keep up with demand because of continued supply-chain challenges, which can lead to long wait times for some products. Scarcity has led vendors to request price markups on their merchandise, sometimes more than once a month for a single product, said Chuck Millsaps, president of Great Outdoor Provision Co., a recreational retailer with nine stores in North Carolina and Virginia. ""When we're able, we've pushed orders ahead,"" Mr. Millsaps said. ""We used to say, don't ship it until it's 70% complete. Now we say, whatever you've got, ship it."" Complicated products with multiple components, like kayaks, might arrive without key parts that have been stranded elsewhere.

868,0,AVIA releases findings of new malware report,544 words,BusinessWorld,"In this study, the objective was to see if consumer perceptions about malware risk and piracy were true (or not), by simulating a user who visited these sites to view streamed content, and then to examine what actual malware infections were encountered. The prediction was that malware would be installed, potentially leading to devices being ransomed, malicious advertising being displayed, or user identities being stolen through credentials being stolen. What was found was that a typical user visiting these sites would be infected by ransomware, several trojan horses, and other Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) within 42 seconds on a Windows machine, and 1:18 for an Android device. The results support the hypothesis that there is a nexus between piracy and malware infections, where site operators generate significant revenue from allowing malicious ads to be placed on their sites. Malware authors can in turn gain access to consumer PCs and mobile devices, and all of the data held in storage, but also access to banking login details and other sensitive logins. This malware could also spread laterally within a home or corporate network, potentially impacting critical business operations, or used as the launchpad for identity theft and identity fraud. Consumers were also at legal risk from signing up to proxy servers which have allegedly been used to participate in DDoS and other attacks in the past. Piracy continues to cause a significant financial impact on the entertainment industry, especially the more contemporary misuse of streaming websites and applications. Streaming provides a real-time, live experience, with premium content relayed in real-time to consumers through a range of technologies, including streaming websites and specialized streaming applications. These illicit sites and applications, in turn, are funded by advertising, creating an enormous business opportunity for organized crime, while at the same time depriving rightsholders and creators of their income. This reduces the incentive for investment in the industry and reduces the rewards for creatives and artists around the world. A recent report by the online consumer safety group Digital Citizens Alliance (2021) and brand safety specialist White Bullet Solutions found that illicit streaming websites and apps were generating an estimated US$1.34 billion in annual revenues through advertising.

513,0,Holidays closer to home popular for New Year,553 words,China Daily,"On Jan 13, a resident surnamed Wang from the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, booked a villa at the local Huabohui Holiday Villa Homestay to celebrate Lunar New Year in the Huabohui scenic area where the villa is located. ""I chose to stay in a hotel during the holiday because it's not only a trendy thing to do, but also because it provides convenience,"" Wang told Hubei Daily. ""Hotels offer good services, and I don't need to worry about what to eat or where to sleep. All I need to do is hang out with friends and have fun."" A staff member with the holiday told Hubei Daily that many regions across the country have been calling on people to stay put during the Lunar New Year holiday to help contain COVID-19. A lot of people who want a change of scenery have chosen to get out of the city and spend the holiday at a hotel in the suburbs. ""All the room types we have are selling well for the holiday, and many have been booked out well in advance,"" the staff member said. According to online travel portal TravelGo, the number of short-distance trips in major city clusters including the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta are set to witness a notable increase, China National Radio reported on Wednesday. Online travel agency Qunar, on Jan 13, reported a near-threefold increase in hotel bookings for the holiday compared with that in 2021. The numbers were also 50 percent higher than pre-COVID-19 levels, Beijing Youth Daily reported on Jan 16. As of Thursday, nearly 60 percent of the hotel bookings for the holiday made through travel-booking platform Ctrip were for hotels within the users' own provinces. The most popular hotel types were family-friendly hotels, hotels with hot springs and urban resorts, according to a Beijing Daily report. ""Because of the pandemic, many families in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu have chosen to go to a hotel or homestay in local suburbs,"" an executive with online travel agency Qunar was quoted as saying by Henan Business Daily. ""One reason is that hotels and homestays have entertainment facilities such as swimming pools and hot springs. Another reason is that young holidaymakers can be spared the trouble of making the Lunar New Year's Eve dinner,"" the executive explained. Amid sporadic COVID-19 flareups in parts of the country, preventing the spread of the disease and protecting consumers and employees remain the top priorities of tourism businesses, Zhou Weihong, deputy general manager of Spring Tour, the travel arm of Shanghai-based Spring Group, told Beijing-based Economic Information Daily. She said although offering these ""mini vacations"" is a ""self-help measure"" tourism businesses have been using to cope with pandemic-induced challenges, it's also a result of the increased sophistication and transparency of the tourism industry, improved urban management and the integration of the tourism and culture sectors."

622,0,Ukraineâs crypto corps and hacker army,845 words,Financial Times (FT.Com),"John Thornhill writes that video and photos on social media, along with crowdsourcing, are giving the lie to Russiaâs disinformation campaign. He contrasts Ukraineâs horizontal network with Russiaâs vertical media structure. âUkraine has mobilised civil society and there is collaboration between state and people. By contrast, the Russian state dominates almost all communication.ï¿½?Ukraine also has a hacker army at its disposal. Hacken, a cyber security company formerly based in Kyiv, is running a bug bounty programme for global hackers to identify vulnerabilities in Ukraineâs systems and expose them in Russiaâs. The company claims to have signed up 10,000 hackers from 150 countries. Some of these hacktivists aim to disrupt Russian media sites and push alternative Ukrainian views across social media. âThe hacker community is so well organised. It is a real army,ï¿½?says Dmytro Budorin, Hackenâs founder and chief executive. Online fundraising is also proving effective and it was bolstered today by plans for Ukraine to become the first developed country to issue its own collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), reports Cristina Criddle. Since the conflict began, the official Ukraine Twitter account has appealed for donations in cryptocurrency, publicly posting addresses for people to make transfers in bitcoin, ethereum, solana and polkadot. Cryptocurrencies totalling more than $50mn have been donated to the government, according to an analysis of transactions by data company Elliptic. The NFT move comes as the EU is considering measures to ensure that Russia does not use cryptocurrencies to circumvent economic sanctions. UK lawmakers are also on alert. âWe are considering how the UK along with its allies can prevent crypto assets from emerging as loopholes to evade sanctions,ï¿½?Baroness Joanna Penn, a government whip, said in the House of Lords on Wednesday. The Internet of (Five) Things 1. OneWebâs Russian space boycott The UK-backed satellite internet company has suspended all future launches from Russiaâs cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, as the invasion of Ukraine shatters the decades-long collaboration between Moscow and the west in space. The move could cost OneWeb roughly $300mn, including the cost of the satellites now stranded in Kazakhstan, and throws into jeopardy its plan to roll out a global service by the end of this year. 2. Amazon backs Ukraine, closes stores The ecommerce giant has announced it will support Ukraine with logistics to get supplies to people needing them, and with cyber security assistance to companies and governments. In other news, Amazon says it plans to close all 68 of its bricks-and-mortar bookstores, pop-ups and shops carrying toys and home goods in the US and UK, as it focuses on its grocery chains. 3. CNN and ITV expand on streaming  WarnerMedia isÂ racing to launchÂ the CNN Plus streaming service before its planned takeover by Discovery, placing a wager of about $350mn on the news channelâs digital future that was not originally disclosed to its incoming owner. In the UK, commercial broadcaster ITV is to launch a revamped streaming service called ITVX in the fourth quarter, saying it is âkey to delivering our target of at least doubling digital revenues to Â£750mn andï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½?âdouble subscribers by 2026 ï¿½? 4. Telecom Italia plunges on break-up plan Shares in Telecom Italia plunged more than 16 per cent on Thursday after the group announced plans to split itself in two as it tries to fend off a ï¿½?0.7bn bid by private equity group KKR. Italyâs biggest telecoms company also reported a net loss of ï¿½?.7bn for 2021. 5. Meta investors face child safety lobby A UK government-backed coalition of charities is set to put pressure on leading Facebook investors.

There were 19,166 new cases reported in Mondayâs health bulletin as compared to 22,751 cases a day ago. Delhi saw a rapid increase in the number of cases since December-end, with the daily tally swelling up from less than 500 to over 22,000 in just twelve days.

291,0,"Vaccine pass already hurting business at struggling Hong Kong restaurants just hours after launch, industry representative says",1092 words,scmp.com,"The launch of the governmentâs vaccine pass scheme has proved to be yet another blow to Hong Kongâs already struggling restaurants, with one industry representative reporting an immediate drop in revenue and patrons being turned away for failing to comply with the new rules. Ray Chui Man-wai, chairman of Kam Kee Holdings, which operates 44 restaurants, said his groupâs business was already down by 40 per cent following the schemeâs introduction on Thursday morning, blaming the vaccine pass and a newly lowered cap on the number of diners per table for dampening peopleâs desire to eat out. âThere are quite a number of diners who still donât know how to use the vaccine pass. They think they only need to scan their âLeave Home Safeï¿½?app, but in fact they need to scan their vaccination record separately,ï¿½?he said. âOur staff need to assist them one by one.ï¿½?Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge [https://www.scmp.com/knowledge], our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Under the scheme, people aged 12 and above must show proof of having received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine [https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/coronavirus-vaccine] to enter government venues and 23 other types of premises, including restaurants, shopping centres, wet markets and supermarkets. Residents must also register their visit on the governmentâs âLeave Home Safeï¿½?risk-exposure app. Chui, who is also the chairman of the industry group Institute of Dining Art, said about 10 per cent of would-be diners on Thursday morning had been barred from entering restaurants as they had forgotten to upload their vaccination record to âLeave Home Safeï¿½? âMost of them were elderly people,ï¿½?he said. âThey had no idea that they needed to save their vaccination records in their app, and felt very frustrated.ï¿½?In Causeway Bay, restaurants, supermarkets and wet markets were unusually subdued on Thursday morning, with patrons few and far between. At Wealthy Garden, a Chinese restaurant in the area, only half the usual number of customers showed up for breakfast, according to an employee who declined to be named. âThat means that we might lose 50 per cent of the revenue,ï¿½?she said, adding that the restaurant was popular with seniors, many of whom still had not been vaccinated ï¿½?though she noted the cold weather could have also played a part. Rather than the large, chatty groups commonly seen at dim sum brunches, the restaurantâs 20 or so customers were spread out in quiet ones and twos to comply with social-distancing rules. Many were still wearing protective gear, such as double masks and eye protection. Wang, an 82-year-old housewife, was frustrated after being denied entry to a supermarket on Thursday. âI canât go anywhere without the vaccine pass now,ï¿½?she said. Though her son previously helped her install the âLeave Home Safeï¿½?app, Wang was not aware it was now needed to get into supermarkets, and had left her phone at home. Wang said she had not yet been vaccinated, and was worried not only about catching the virus, but also being barred from the places where she shopped for food. âI didnât have a clear answer from my doctor about whether I am fit for vaccination due to my chronic conditions,ï¿½?she said. Those with a valid medical excuse for not being jabbed are exempt from using the vaccine pass, but they must provide a doctorâs certificate. All venue employees must also be fully inoculated as part of the scheme, though they can also claim a medical exemption with a doctorâs certificate. Although checking of vaccination records at shopping centres was passive, some residents still needed help. A 73-year-old woman who called herself Yip sought help from Apple store staff in Causeway Bay to upload her vaccination record to her smartphone from a hard copy. âI wish my son was here,ï¿½?Yip said. At Harbour City mall in Tsim Sha Tsui, shopper Phoebe Chan said she took her first jab on Wednesday to fulfil vaccine pass requirements. âThe government should spend more effort controlling the pandemic, instead of controlling our normal lives,ï¿½?said Chan, a 22-year-old university student. Residents can either present their paper vaccine certificate or upload an electronic one to âLeave Home Safeï¿½?or other government apps to create a QR code as proof of inoculation. âLeave Home Safeï¿½?is required for entering restaurants. Data stored by the app is encrypted and will automatically be erased after 31 days. Machines installed at restaurants to scan QR codes will notify staff with various sound alerts as to whether a patronâs inoculation or exemption record is valid. Exceptions to the scheme will include entering a venue to buy takeaway or retrieve belongings, getting tested or vaccinated, attending government, legal or medical appointments, or commuting home or to work. Certain premises, such as restaurants and clubhouses, will also require staff to actively check patronsï¿½?inoculation or exemption records, while customers must scan a QR code before entering. Venues such as malls, supermarkets, department stores and wet markets will only be subject to passive checks ï¿½?consisting of providing vaccination records when asked by law enforcement officers. However, a Cantonese restaurant with more than 60 years of business on Tuesday said it would close its doors for two weeks from Thursday, as it could not complete preparations for the vaccine pass on time. âNo vaccination, no business, no life,ï¿½?said Alan Yan Cheuk-lun, owner of Man Shing Restaurant in Tai Hang. Yan said he, his 64-year-old mother and his two brothers, who all operate the restaurant together, could not get vaccinated for medical reasons. âIt is time for us to take a rest and have our body checks,ï¿½?he said. A government spokesman said restaurant staff with a certified medical exemption should undergo Covid-19 testing every seven days, while those without one would need to get their shots to return to work."
138,0,Young & loaded,1141 words,The Straits Times,"Adam (not his real name), who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: ""People think drugs are very hard to get in Singapore, but actually before the pandemic they were everywhere, and even now there are people selling them."" The parties were often organised by children of wealthy families, including expatriates. They are typically referred to as young and loaded - slang for rich and also for being under the influence of drugs. There would be alcohol and music at the events, while some would retreat to a corner to use drugs. Most people at the parties Adam attended were under 30. There were times when he attended one every weekend, with some hosted in expensive hotels and condominiums, and others in Housing Board flats. Some of these parties were organised entirely around using drugs, while others involved alcohol and other activities, with just a few people taking drugs. At one such party in 2019 in Fajar Road, the Central Narcotics Bureau arrested seven people, aged between 13 and 18. Some of these drug parties have ended in tragedy. In 2018, a 19-year-old medical student from the National University of Singapore died after taking 25B-NBOMe, a new psychoactive substance that is a modified version of lysergic acid diethylamide, more commonly known as LSD. He had consumed it at a ""trip"" (slang for getting high) party. A polytechnic student who organised the illicit drug gathering was later charged. The drugs are not cheap. During the pandemic, the price of MDMA, a psychoactive drug commonly known as Ecstasy or Molly, went up to $80 a pill from $50. Other drugs like ketamine saw prices go up to $130 to $200 a gram, from $80 to $100 a gram. Adam said he rarely met drug dealers himself but was always in contact with people who knew them. Encrypted messaging apps are a popular platform. Checks by ST last year showed that on 20 Telegram chat groups selling drugs and drug paraphernalia, most had about 300 to 500 members while a few had more than 2,400 members. After payment is made, sellers would leave the drugs with runners or at drop-off points. Between January 2019 and Sept 17 last year, the Central Narcotics Bureau arrested 77 traffickers linked to Telegram transactions. Adam, now 23 and doing his national service, said he would often gather with groups of close friends - a collection of both Singaporeans and expats or children of expats - to use substances like cannabis and MDMA. The phenomenon of drug use among Singapore's international community and some wealthy people here has surfaced in the news from time to time. In 2019, the scion of a rich business family in Singapore pleaded guilty to cannabis possession and consumption. He was sentenced to a jail term of two years and two months. He had started smoking marijuana at age 21 while studying overseas, and continued the habit on his return to Singapore. Adam started at an even younger age. He was 14 when he first smoked marijuana. A group of friends from secondary school had offered it to him at the playground of a condominium where one of them lived. He said he started using drugs to deal with anxiety and attention deficit hyperactive disorder, and later switched to harder drugs. ""As cliched as it sounds, every drug I've done later was for the thrill of finding the next high. I was 15 when I tried LSD, 18 when I started using benzos, 20 when I did my first line of cocaine, ketamine and MDMA."" Benzos is short for benzodiazepines, a class of psychoactive drugs used to treat depression or anxiety, which he has been diagnosed with. Adam said his parents - his father works in drug rehabilitation - were suspicious. But he continued to do relatively well in school and earned himself a diploma. So they trusted him. He said he was influenced by what he watched and read. After reading The Perks Of Being A Wallflower by American writer Stephen Chbosky, Adam wanted to be like Bob, a stereotypical ""stoner"" character in the coming-of-age novel where several teenagers use drugs such as marijuana and LSD. ""I did LSD for the first time because I was stupid, didn't know better and thought I was the main character on Skins,"" said Adam. Skins is a British television programme that explores teenage drug use. But escapism from emotional trauma was also at the root of his addiction. When he was a child, he was sexually assaulted by his sister, who is now in jail for a separate offence involving drug trafficking. He said the drugs were not just recreational, but also a coping mechanism for pain which he felt therapy could not solve, especially during a period of about 10 months beginning in March 2020. He popped pills every weekend, and also tried to end his life several times. While his first contact with drugs was through his friends, it was also his social group that got him out of hard drugs, he said. ""My friends saw how much I was spiralling and we all decided to stay sober together and cut ourselves off from people who dealt (drugs)."" He added that while he agrees with Singapore's hard stance on drugs, he is concerned that it may drive people to consume whatever they can get their hands on.""I think drugs are bad and do a lot of harm to families and the community. But it's not going to stop young kids from trying drugs at a party or a rave,"" he said.

232,0,Ten of thousands of restaurants have closed during the pandemic. The inside story of one family's battle to save theirs.,5489 words,Washington Post.com,"Janet wasn't too worried as she pulled into the covered garage that Wednesday morning at the Westfield Wheaton mall, where she was protected from the elements on her short walk to Hollywood East on the first floor. She figured Alan had a cold. Plus, she had a business to run, a Cantonese/Hong Kong restaurant that was a fixture not just of the Maryland suburbs, but of the wider D.C. region, thanks largely to its dim sum service. Every weekend, pre-pandemic, diners would crowd their tables with orders of siu mai and har gow dumplings, steamed roast pork buns, sticky rice with Chinese sausage, and delicate rice-noodle crepes that conceal tiny curls of shrimp. The service attracted large multicultural crowds that would happily wait for a table in a 140-seat dining room whose walls were painted a vibrant shade of red, a color associated with joy and luck in China, but one also thought to make diners hungry. Alan was usually the first person customers met at Hollywood East. Regulars called him Pops or Dad. If he wasn't at the host stand, greeting diners, he was at the bar, mixing them a drink, maybe the Pops Special, a signature cocktail that his sons claim was basically an apple martini, heavy on the vodka. Pops earned his nickname, his admirers say, because he took care of customers as if they were kin. He loved to swap stories, but he also dressed the part. He was known for his impressive wardrobe, an ever-changing, ever-fashionable line of suits, blazers, bow ties, vests and the occasional ascot. Hollywood East supported not just Alan and Janet but also two of their four sons: Corey, 35, and Tim, 29. Both worked at the restaurant and could do just about any job required. Hollywood East was also a part-time gig for their eldest son, Jeff, 38, a personal trainer who handled the restaurant's social media accounts and sometimes its online ordering system remotely from his home in Irvine, Calif. Only Brian, 31, was not actively involved. In 2019, according to tax documents shared with The Washington Post, Hollywood East earned the family $1.26 million in gross sales. In March 2020, however, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan shut down indoor dining, forcing restaurateurs throughout the state, including the Yus, to switch to delivery and carryout only. Hollywood East was in a better position than many to make the pivot. Before the shutdown, the restaurant had earned about 30 percent of its sales from carryout. Plus, the Yus weren't naive about the pandemic's potential impact. ""I looked at how a lot of the other countries handled covid,"" Jeff says. ""The government saying, 'This is what we're going to do,' and everybody has to listen, versus here, where everyone has their rights to different freedoms and such. I was like, 'Ah, man, nothing is ever going to get done.' "" There was, for example, no mask mandate in Maryland in the early days of the pandemic. Customers could still enter Hollywood East without a face covering and place an order. They could pass the time at Alan's bar and have a drink while waiting on a carryout order. Many did not mask. Alan didn't mask. Their elected leaders had told them it wasn't necessary yet. Maryland wouldn't have a mask mandate until mid-April. Later that April evening, Janet returned home to find Alan sweating. He had a slight fever, too. Alan slept downstairs, away from the rest of the family, and arose the next morning feeling no better. He was supposed to have a virtual call with a doctor, but the family was unable to reach the physician. Desperate for advice, Janet phoned her insurance carrier and was told they should get Alan to the hospital. With Janet unable to leave the restaurant, Corey was dispatched to drive his father to a local hospital. The last words Janet said to Alan before he left hung in the air, like a prayer. ""You'll be okay,"" she told him. ""Don't worry."" At the hospital, Corey wasn't allowed to stay, so Alan sat for hours, alone, waiting for someone to attend to him. At some point that evening, a nurse swabbed Alan's nose to check for the coronavirus. After the swab, Alan, who had his phone and iPad, told his family that his nose wouldn't stop bleeding. Blood was dripping down his throat and into his oxygen mask. The family knew why: Alan was on blood thinners. At around age 20, Alan was diagnosed with mitral valve disease. He initially had the leaky valve replaced with one harvested from a pig, which had served him well for more than 15 years. When that valve gave out, doctors replaced it with an artificial one, which required Alan to take blood thinners for the rest of his life. He would frequently get nose bleeds, but this one at the hospital was particularly bad. In the days that followed, Janet and her family found it next to impossible to get reliable updates on Alan. Unable to even learn the result of his swab, the family didn't know if he had covid or if his heart was acting up. Alan was, after all, scheduled for tests on the valve before the pandemic hit. In the absence of information, the family could only do what it always did: Janet, Corey and Tim went to work at Hollywood East. They still had people to feed. Like many restaurant families, the Yus had faced crises before ï¿½?including losing their restaurant once to unforeseen circumstances. Yet nothing in the family's past could have prepared them for the pandemic, with its unpredictable churn of shutdowns, restrictions, mandates, staff shortages, supply-line disruptions, rising costs and plummeting revenue. In just the first year of the pandemic, from March 2020 to April 2021, the National Restaurant Association would estimate that 90,000 establishments around the country had closed, either permanently or temporarily. Such statistics have become hard to fathom in the abstract. They are divorced from the personal stories and ambitions that give life to family-owned restaurants like Hollywood East and from the distinctive roles they play in the communities they serve. The stats also say nothing about the immigrant experience in America, where restaurants have traditionally been a way for newcomers to gain a foothold in their new country while still holding fast to the food and culture of their homeland. To Janet and Alan, Hollywood East was more than a way to support the family. For 24 years, their restaurant had been a place to gather, to share stories, to create memories. It was the place where they celebrated the Lunar New Year, where Alan and his sons performed traditional Chinese lion dances to ward off evil and bring good luck. But such good-luck rituals were no match for the pandemic. Over the next 22 months, the family would be tested like never before, both personally and professionally. They would put all their effort and ingenuity into keeping their restaurant, the place where Pops had poured so many drinks and forged so many friendships, alive. Would it be enough? Alan Yu was born and raised in Hong Kong but moved to the United States in 1975 and settled briefly in Luray, Va., where some cousins ran a restaurant. He worked there as a bartender and also established a martial arts school in Washington's Chinatown neighborhood. Janet met him in early 1976 through mutual friends. Theirs was a quick courtship: Weeks after they met, Alan, then 19, pulled out a ring while he and Janet, 21, sat on a friend's porch in Silver Spring. "" 'What is this for?' "" she recalls asking Alan. "" 'You want to marry me?' I said, 'Oh, okay.' "" Born in Washington, Janet grew up in a restaurant family. Her parents ran China Royal, a Chinese American restaurant in Silver Spring, where her father, a World War II veteran, was chef. She started working there at age 5, walking orders back to the kitchen for the cooks to prepare. It would be a formative experience: She swore she would never work in a restaurant again. When she met Alan, she was working for National Airlines as a sales agent. After he had his first valve replacement surgery, Alan had to close his martial arts school. He eventually got into the jewelry business and opened his own store in Silver Spring, where he hatched the idea of starting a restaurant. Janet tried to tell him how hard and time-consuming it would be. In 1996, he opened Hollywood East anyway with a partner in the construction business. The original Hollywood East (the name was a nod to the Hong Kong singers and actors whom Alan would occasionally bring to Washington to perform) was a small storefront, with only a dozen or so glass-topped tables. To Janet, the daughter of restaurateurs, it quickly became clear that Alan and his partner had no idea how to run the place. The menu was too large, the chefs wasteful, the staff inexperienced. The business was behind on the rent after only a few months. Janet, who by then had left the airline business, took matters into her own hands. She used her money to pay off the restaurant's back rent and squeezed out Alan's partner. She replaced the wasteful chefs, stopped serving breakfast, trimmed back the menu and introduced dishes like whole steamed fish and salted fish, which offered locals a taste of Taishan, China, her and Alan's ancestral home. Janet's changes attracted the attention of Phyllis C. Richman, then restaurant critic for The Post. Under the headline ""Poised for Stardom,"" Richman wrote, ""Hollywood East should really be named Guangzhou West. It's a Chinese restaurant. And even more astonishing: It's one of the best I've tried in years."" The February 1998 review immediately changed Hollywood East's fortunes. Within a month, Janet and Alan approached their landlord about taking over the space next to theirs, which would nearly double their seating capacity to more than 100. The restaurant also started to attract non-Asian customers, eager to sample the dishes that had delighted Richman. To Janet and Alan, the review and the public response were validation of their food and culture, but also of their hard work. Alan was still running his jewelry store. When he closed for the day, he would drive straight to Hollywood East and work there till closing. Janet was juggling four sons, ages 4 to 14, while running the restaurant. She would drive the kids to school in the morning, go to work at Hollywood East, pick the boys up in the afternoon, take them to the restaurant and then drive them home in the early evening. But she and Alan didn't put their kids to work. Perhaps as a result, most of them think differently about the restaurant business than Janet. ""It's really fun,"" says Corey. ""If everything's operating nicely, it's very enjoyable."" The family opened a second location, Hollywood East Cafe on the Boulevard, in the mid-2000s. It was here where the family introduced dim sum to the menu, which only increased the popularity of their business. But starting in late 2008 they faced a series of financial crises: They decided to close the original Hollywood East, but the landlord refused to let the Yus out of the lease and sued them for cash owed. Then, for reasons the family could not understand, they were evicted from their second Silver Spring location, which they had taken out loans to finance and construct. In 2010, they filed for bankruptcy. Janet and Alan took on odd jobs ï¿½?Janet started catering, Alan sold jewelry ï¿½?until April 2010, when they were able to start again with a new Hollywood East, this time at the Westfield Wheaton mall. They had to make countless sacrifices, but the family felt as if they had survived a crisis that would have killed lesser restaurants. Then came the pandemic ï¿½?and Alan's latest illness. Even as she worked the dim sum service on the Sunday after Alan was hospitalized, Janet couldn't stop thinking of her husband. In between orders, she would call the hospital for updates. She would get transferred from one line to another, each a dead end. Alan could no longer provide any information, either. He had been put on a ventilator the day before. On Monday evening, Janet finally received a call from the hospital. A doctor wanted Janet's permission to start a procedure that might help Alan. ""They called back an hour later and said he's gone,"" Janet says, her voice shaking at the memory. Alan Yu died after midnight on Tuesday, April 14. The family hadn't had a chance to say goodbye. They also couldn't give Alan a proper send-off. St. Andrew Apostle Catholic Church wasn't allowing indoor funerals. But the Rev. Dan Leary, then pastor at St. Andrew, where Janet and her sons have been faithful parishioners, worked out an arrangement to host services in the parking lot. Mourners drove by Alan's casket, which was surrounded by flowers and other plants under a makeshift tent, to pay their last respects. Those who couldn't make the service watched via a live feed, including a cousin deployed in Afghanistan. The nearly two-hour live stream was interspersed with video testimonials and remembrances of Alan's life. David Smith, a former security guard at the Wheaton mall, shared an anecdote about how Alan had offered to give Smith something to eat when the guard was hungry. Smith had begged off. He said he couldn't afford it. Pops told him not to worry about it, a gesture that, according to Janet, Alan made regularly. ""I've never been given anything like that in my life,"" Smith said in his video testimonial. ""Pops, Mom, all the boys treated me instantly like family. Which in the world that we are living in today, to transcend race and anything else, it was a feeling that I've never felt anywhere else, not even in the military."" Father Dan, as the Yu family calls Leary, was struck by the mourners' connection to Pops. ""That's the mark of a loving man,"" Leary told Janet and three of her four sons at the service. (Jeff didn't fly in from California because it was too risky at the time.) ""Guys, I pray that you have that, because the world certainly needs more people that love like your Pop,"" the priest added. The priest's words seemed to hit home with Alan's sons. They immediately rallied around their 65-year-old mother, a widow now left to run Hollywood East through a pandemic still in its early stages. ""We already lost one parent. We didn't want to lose another one,"" says Corey. ""We had to do whatever we [could] to continue the business and to keep everybody safe."" After Alan's death, Hollywood East closed for nearly a month, the longest stretch the restaurant had ever been dormant. The family had to quarantine for two weeks. They also had to clean and disinfect the restaurant. Janet received hundreds of cards, emails, letters and phone calls from friends, family and loyal customers. She also cried a lot, in secret. ""I know the boys feel bad,"" she said. ""I just want them to think that I'm okay."" Corey channeled his grief into creating a method to prevent customers from interacting with anyone inside the restaurant for the remainder of the pandemic, especially his mother. He had always been the tech-savvy son, building his own computer at age 12. His creation for Hollywood East would be a toy by comparison. At first, Corey positioned tables just inside the restaurant's entrance facing the parking garage, with wooden screens behind them to create a self-contained carryout space within the bar. Then he used painter's tape to section off each table into numbered slots and attached an iPad to an adjustable arm mounted to one of the tables. The iPad served as the restaurant's sole form of customer interaction: A family member stationed at the command center, then located in the dormant dining room, could talk to customers via a video function on the iPad. Janet's head might magically appear on the tablet above the carryout table ï¿½?sort of like the Wizard of Oz of dim sum ï¿½?and she'd direct customers to the appropriate slot where they could pick up their orders. But Corey wanted to pump up the entertainment value, so he replaced the painter's tape with lights. It was Hollywood East meets the Magic Kingdom. ""I'm a big fan of Disney,"" says Corey, ""and they're all about experience."" Even with Corey's touchless system in place, when the family finally reopened Hollywood East on May 9, 2020, they still faced a host of problems ï¿½?some that dated from the start of the pandemic, others that were new. The Westfield Wheaton never officially closed, but by county order, most retailers were forced to shut down for more than three months, from March to June 2020, which affected foot traffic to the mall. Corey doesn't think semi-closure, or even Westfield Wheaton's shorter operating hours, hurt restaurant sales all that much. But what did, Corey suspects, is Hollywood East's lack of an outdoor patio, where diners felt safer during the pandemic. Hollywood East has only a ""patio"" inside a corridor at the mall. An even bigger issue for Hollywood East was delivery. Unlike D.C., Montgomery County never put a cap on third-party delivery fees, which meant Uber Eats, the service the Yu family used, was free to charge a 30 percent fee on every order. The family had decided to turn off its Uber Eats account at the start of the pandemic because they couldn't afford to absorb those fees. Instead, Corey and Tim delivered the food themselves. But this DIY solution hit a snag when the restaurant reopened after Alan's death. Four of Hollywood East's eight cooks opted not to return, including three who worked the stir-fry station, a vital part of the kitchen. Corey and Tim needed to step in. The family shut down all deliveries for the foreseeable future. Corey's ability to help, however, was limited. In 2019, he had ruptured a disk in his back while weightlifting. He had been managing the problem with weekly massages, but those sessions evaporated during the shutdown. His condition had worsened to the point where he could barely walk, let alone stand for an entire shift. He was scheduled for back surgery, but on May 25, he tested positive for the coronavirus. He's still not sure how he contracted it, given that he was operating the restaurant's ordering system, alone, in the back of the dining room. Fortunately, he was asymptomatic, but the positive result delayed his back surgery until late June. In the meantime, Hollywood East had to make do with a patchwork of stir-fry cooks, including Alan's brother, Pong Yu, who ran a carryout years ago. ""He's a plumber, and the last time he cooked was, maybe, about 12 years ago,"" Tim says about his uncle. Tim had to step up and lead the kitchen, delaying his own career plans. A formally trained chef, Tim had had offers to join other kitchens, where he could pursue other styles of Chinese cooking. He was also working on his own project, Dabao, a modern dumpling/takeout concept that he was hoping to open in a food hall in Riverdale Park, Md. He figured he could shuttle between Hollywood East and his own place. But on reflection, he realized the timing was not right. ""I'm not going to leave my family without anybody to cook,"" Tim says. ""I wouldn't do that."" Without a fully staffed stir-fry team, the restaurant had to come up with creative solutions to relieve the pressures on the wok station. Janet and her sons decided to trim the menu, eliminating at least 20 percent of the dishes. They also started serving dim sum all day, in the hopes that customers would not order as many stir-fry dishes. Customers adapted, remembers Corey. If they couldn't find a favorite dish, they would order something close to it. But the limitations of Corey's touchless carryout system were starting to reveal themselves. Customers would occasionally paw through bags, impatient for someone to appear on the iPad screen to tell them which order was theirs. Then there was the change of seasons: When the mercury started to drop, the open door at the carryout station created a chill inside the restaurant, causing once-hot carryout meals to turn stone cold. Corey tackled the problem anew. He disassembled a free-standing Ikea closet at home and combined the cheap particleboard with solid wood pieces to fashion a half-dozen boxes with hydraulic lids, which someone at the command center could open and close via an iPad. Under the new system, once a takeout order was ready, Janet or Corey (or even Jeff working remotely from California) would tell food runner Eric Ramirez which box to place the bags in. When customers arrived, a family member would appear on the video iPad to tell them where their order was. The family member would then push a button, the lid on the designated box would lift and customers would grab their bags. It was an ingenious engineering feat that solved the latest set of problems, plus ï¿½?after Corey repainted the particleboard to resemble candy canes ï¿½?provided a bit of whimsy. During Christmastime, Corey added lights and fake snow to accessorize the boxes. ""It was like a Christmas present, your dim sum order,"" says Ben Rich, the chief of staff for Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.) and a loyal patron of Hollywood East. But to Jeff, the carryout system provided something else, too, particularly after the family installed heavy curtain dividers in the bar to try to insulate the dining room/command center from the cold breezes that shot through the open door: It essentially camouflaged the space that was Alan Yu's second home. The carryout space was, in effect, a business solution and a coping mechanism, a way to limit the pain of walking through Alan's bar every single day. ""Those physical places where he was would just bring back memories,"" Jeff says. ""So taking the operations away from there kind of helped out."" A different kind of help came from the government, both federal and local. In April 2020, the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program, designed to help employers cover payroll during the pandemic, sent Four Kings Enterprises, the company named for Janet and Alan's sons, $37,199. The following month, Four Kings received about $150,000 through the agency's covid-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan. The low-interest loan allowed Janet to cover a wider range of expenses than the PPP money, including rent, utilities and business debt. There were also small grants from Montgomery County that helped defray the costs of safety equipment and takeout containers. All of this money helped a lot, but it also disappeared fast, especially because Hollywood East never cut salaries and continued to pay employees while closed. ""I don't think we would be able to survive"" without the governmental assistance, Janet says. Survival, however, didn't mean success. By the end of 2020, Hollywood East's gross revenue was down 29 percent from 2019, to only $893,932, a decrease of nearly $365,000, according to tax records. Despite the declining revenue, the restaurant's landlord, Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, a commercial real estate company based in France, still expected $15,000 every month for rent, taxes, water and community area management fees, Janet says. It was a grim situation that required radical decisions. Janet made sure to pay her vendors, the small businesses that kept her supplied with ingredients and the other necessities to run a restaurant. But from there, she made painful choices to pay only fractions of what she owed. She paid the landlord about a third of her monthly statement. Same with the utility companies. For a restaurateur who prided herself on paying her bills, these partial payments weighed on her mind. ""Who wouldn't be worried?"" she says. The second year of the pandemic was no easier than the first for Hollywood East. In fact, it may have been harder. The family had to muddle through the same issues as every other restaurant operator: skyrocketing prices, supply-chain disruptions, labor shortages, to name only a few. Corey and Janet have horror stories about trying to source cooking oil in 2021. Hollywood East goes through about six to seven containers of oil a week. In normal times, they would pay about $20 per 35-pound container, but at the height of the scarcity, their suppliers were charging around $60 per container, Corey recalls. It got to the point where, instead of working through suppliers, Corey would order oil online at Sam's Club and then drive 45 minutes to pick up the containers himself. He even figured out the secret to Sam's Club: The retailer updates its website early in the morning. Corey would stay up till 3:30 a.m. or so just to place an order for cooking oil. After more than a year without delivery, Hollywood East decided to reactivate its Uber Eats account, but with one major change: The family raised prices 30 percent for delivery orders, to cover the app's fees. They even added dim sum to the Uber Eats menu, which was a hit, according to Corey. But not enough of one to cover Janet's expenses, including her monthly payment to the mall. Desperate, Janet hired someone to scout new locations for Hollywood East while she and her broker began negotiating with Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield. With the clock ticking on her current lease, Janet struggled to make the decision whether to stay or go. In June, she sat around a table inside the restaurant with Corey and Tim, weighing the options. ""There's so many memories. Do I really want to stay here?"" she said. ""I kind of don't want to."" Whatever happens, Corey interjected, ""I think you've done a great job."" ""If I move, I think I might feel better, but it costs a lot of money to move,"" Janet continued. ""How many years? Twenty-six years,"" Corey said, trying to make his mom feel a sense of accomplishment, rather than defeat. ""Twenty-six years, it's very good."" Janet didn't seem to be listening to her son. She was lost in her own thoughts and the reality of life without Alan, her partner of 44 years. ""It's almost like you don't have that extra person to talk to ï¿½?that you had to talk to before when you needed to make a decision,"" Janet said. ""I can't talk to him,"" she added, nodding toward Corey. ""We never agree."" She started to cry. In August, Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield offered Hollywood East a two-year deal that would cut the rent and fees to less than $10,000 a month. It would also forgive more than $100,000 in back rent and fees. (The company doesn't discuss confidential lease negotiations.) Janet's broker thought it was a great deal, but Janet feared it still wouldn't work for a restaurant with diminishing revenue: Although Four Kings had received a second PPP draw in February 2021 for $52,296, Hollywood East grossed only about $500,000 last year, Corey says, down even more from its 2020 numbers. The lower sales, Corey says, are partly because the family didn't reopen its dining room until September, long after others did. They weren't convinced it was safe to return indoors, either for the staff or the diners. When Hollywood East did reopen, it was a changed place. The weekend dim sum carts were gone. So were the servers. They were replaced with a new QR-code system that provides contactless interaction, but at the expense of traditional Cantonese and Hong Kong dim sum culture. It was a trade-off that diners like Rich, the Hill staffer and Hollywood East regular, understood, although he had appreciated how the carts sometimes allowed him to try a dish he would never have sampled otherwise. His two sons, however, have found a way to re-create the service at home with a red wagon and toy chest on wheels: They place their takeout orders in each ""cart"" and act as servers, right in Rich's dining room. ""Our younger son would have the fried cart and the older son would have the steamed cart,"" Rich says. The new, streamlined Hollywood East didn't seem like just a temporary fix, either. As the year progressed, Janet and her sons talked more earnestly about permanently changing the model of Hollywood East. Janet was toying with the idea of opening a smaller place, more fusion-oriented, devoted to breakfast and lunch services only. Corey, on the other hand, fantasized about an automated restaurant ï¿½?he calls it a ""robot restaurant"" ï¿½?in which a ""high-speed train"" delivers an order straight to the table. He saw a video about such a place in Japan. But, in December, the rise of the coronavirus's omicron variant made those dreams feel remote. As the case rates rose and diners once again started staying away, Janet found it hard to reimagine Hollywood East's future. On a cold afternoon in early January, Janet sits at a makeshift desk, a pair of dining room tables pushed together in what used to be Alan's bar. She monitors a constellation of iPads, punching in orders to the kitchen from Uber Eats, ChowNow and even the QR-code orders from the increasingly rare diners who venture into Hollywood East during the omicron surge. Her presence in this space is the latest sign of her acceptance of life without her husband. Janet remembers that, for months, she couldn't even bring herself to pull out photos of Alan. Then about nine months after his death, she placed a picture of him on the dining room table at home and surrounded it with candles and religious statuary. In the photo, Alan is smiling at the camera, looking dashing in his black peacoat and scarf. Every morning, before she heads to her command center at Hollywood East, she talks to Alan's photo. She asks him what she should do about the restaurant. ""He says I should not stay where I am. I should go somewhere else,"" Janet says. ""He doesn't feel that the mall is safe for me."" Despite this advice, she still hasn't decided what to do. She hasn't signed the two-year deal with the mall. To her mind, the economics don't work. She says she can't afford paying $5,000 a month, let alone the higher amount the landlord wants. She doesn't want to put herself in a hole again. In the meantime, Hollywood East continues operating month by month, though Janet says the landlord is pressing hard for an answer. Sometimes the stress of the decision is too much. But then Janet remembers a moment some weeks after Alan died. She felt him visit her in her sleep. He always called her Mom. ""Mom, don't worry,"" he told her. ""You will be okay."" It was the same advice that she had given Alan the morning before he entered the hospital. The words comforted Janet. They made her feel stronger, as if she could defeat anything, including a pandemic. Tim Carman is a food reporter and Casual Dining columnist for The Washington Post."
924,1,China start-up Haofood attracts Rich Products investment for peanut-protein chicken.,608 words,Just-Food,"Haofood said it launched an Asian fried chicken alternative, with peanuts the primary ingredient, to Chinese consumers last July. The company says it has âmore than 50 brands under its portfolioï¿½?with its products sold in âmore than 200 outletsï¿½?in China. Rich Products, the privately-owned US bakery and desserts business, has joined the seed round in Haofood via its funding arm Rich Product Ventures (RPV). It is the fundâs first direct investment in the Asia Pacific. The parent company, however, has had a presence in China for more than three decades.  Henry Soesanto, the CEO of Monde Nissin, the Philippines-based food and beverage firm and owner of the Quorn vegan company in the UK, also took part. Big Idea Ventures, the alternative-protein venture fund and accelerator, contributed as well. Jay Lin, RPVâs vice president for strategic investments in the Asia Pacific, said: âHaofoodâs robust R&D and proprietary technology gives it a competitive advantage, winning over discerning Asian consumers with its great-tasting and sustainable chicken-alternative products. This is our first direct strategic investment in the Asia-Pacific region and we look forward to working closely with the team to scale the business in China and beyond.ï¿½?RPV backed Dao Foodsï¿½?venture fund in China last year seeking out opportunities in alternative-protein start-ups. Previous investments feature cell-based meat firm Future Meat in Israel, US-based cell-cultured seafood firm BlueNalu and mushroom ingredients supplier MycoTechnology in Colorado. Haofood was founded by entrepreneurs Astrid Prajogo (CEO), Dr Shaowei Liu (CSO), Jenny Zhu (CFO) and Kasih Chen (CTO). The company uses its Innotein proprietary technology to create âplant-based chicken from peanuts and other plant protein that has a distinctive texture and umami taste profileï¿½? Astrid said in a statement: âWe are honoured to have received backing from investors who share our passion for creating plant-based chicken alternatives that are not only sustainable, but that people enjoy. With this round of funding we will be able to innovate further and make excellent quality alternative-protein products more accessible for consumers in China and across Asia.ï¿½?Big Idea Ventures was launched in 2019 with backing from Swiss ingredients business BÃ¼hler, US meat giant Tyson Foods and Temasek, Singaporeâs state investment arm. It has invested in a range of businesses such as Grounded Foods, a US-based firm specialising in plant-based cheese, Shiok Meats, a Singapore cell-cultured food start-up, and Zhenmeat, a Chinese company marketing alternatives to pork and crayfish.  Monde Nissin joined Big Idea Ventures last year in a seed funding round in Philippinesï¿½?alternative-meat business WTH Foods. Soesanto has also invested in Shiok Meats and Future Meat. âThe consumers today demand healthier and more sustainable foods. The creative use of peanuts gives Haofoodâs chicken its great taste but it also has even more benefits to the environment in terms of reduced water usage. It stood out to me for its clever use of food technology,ï¿½?Soesanto said. This article was originally published on just-food.com on 14 April 2022.

740,0,Media Bias and Hunter's Laptop; The press won't claw back its credibility until it admits why it buried the story.,847 words,The Wall Street Journal Online,"As if waking from a coma, the Washington Post last week finally asked, ""Why is confirmation of a story that first surfaced in the fall of 2020 emerging only now?"" Alas, the paper entitles its editorial [https://www-washingtonpost-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/opinions/2022/04/03/hunter-biden-story-is-an-opportunity-reckoning/] ""an opportunity for a reckoning,"" because, you know, opportunities can be turned down. And the Post does. Instead it justifies the suppression by saying that, because the press was the ""unwitting tools of a Russian influence campaign in 2016,"" it was ""only prudent to suspect a similar plot lay behind the mysterious appearance of a computer stuffed with juicy documents and conveniently handed over to President Donald Trump's toxic personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani."" Skip past the overreliance on modifiers (mysterious, toxic, conveniently), a hallmark of bad argumentation and bad writing. Newspapers are supposed to be skeptical about everything but as an aid in pursuing the truth, not as an excuse not to pursue the truth. The Post repeatedly invokes the word ""hack"" for the laptop disclosures as if unknown persons had posted information of unknown provenance on the web. This is not remotely what happened. An established news organization, the New York Post, had vetted digital records with a known backstory, described by named, credible sources, starting with the Delaware technician in whose repair shop Hunter reportedly abandoned the laptop. The tabloid's competitors had plenty of leads to confirm or disprove the story. Hunter and his father could be asked to deny it (which they never did). Recipients or people named in the published emails could be rung up, including the onetime Hunter business partner Tony Bobulinski. In addition, the press is not forbidden to don its thinking cap: Faking a laptop drive with hundreds of thousands of documents would be ridiculously disproportionate to any aim the Kremlin might hope to achieve. The Kremlin has easier ways to put fake information into circulation. This is the real lesson of those previous ""Russian influence campaigns."" Occam's razor strongly suggested that the laptop, if not every document on it, was exactly what it was purported to beâand intelligent journalists everywhere knew it. The job of ""newspapers of record"" is to establish the truth or falsity of important matters in the public sphere, and whether the laptop was real or not certainly qualified. But instead of doing its job, the press preferred to line up behind 50 former U.S. intelligence officials who (without evidence, even they admitted) claimed the story was Russian disinformation. This is where the Post editorial really falls down on the reality principle, the lodestar of our business. The media did so because the laptop story was plainly a threat to Joe Biden's election. They'd seen this movie beforeâwith James Comey's late intervention in 2016âand ""knew"" Donald Trump's re-election would be a disaster for the country. If you don't see the same presumption already working overtime and on steroids in advance of 2024, you aren't paying attention. This is why the ""reckoning"" the Post mentions is so urgent and the paper's performance such a disappointment. My own prayer is Mr. Trump won't run and that somebody half-decent will, but I don't lie to myself that the survival of the republic depends on my preferences being fulfilled. History has its own mind. Hard to describe as anything but neurotic, however, is a press that preferred an unsupported assertion about a Russian plot to the self-evident facts of the laptop caseâor, for that matter, believed a badly typed collection of anonymous claims about Donald Trump and Russia (aka the Steele dossier) was the secret record of the greatest political conspiracy in history. What seems closer to certain is that the rule of law and our democratic system are in greater danger when elite institutions work to discredit their outcomes than when self-proclaimed ""deplorables"" do. Our national press cowards, though, aren't about to admit how much they strengthened Mr. Trump, almost re-elected him and made ""stop the steal"" credible to millions of Americans because, starting in 2016-17, they chose to oppose him with lies instead of the truth. If the problem were one Washington Post editorial, nobody would care. But it's not. Our media could use a period of intensive cognitive behavioral therapy to help it get back to seeing what's in front of its eyes and reporting accurately. In those hopefully rare occasions when the press still feels it must lie (say, to defeat Donald Trump), at least it could be honest with itself about what it's doing.

29,0,"As Olympic torch is lit in hope, I see light at end of the tunnel",790 words,Sunday Herald,"When Ivy League universities in America are closing their doors and sending students home until August, donât rule out the first cancellation of an Olympic Games since World War II.? The IOC and host nation Japan are still confident that the Games will go ahead as planned, but no one has any real idea on how long this might go on for. Just from athletes I have spoken to, there is definitely real concern over the Games. The concern isnât just over whether the games get cancelled or not. For each individual athlete, it is also over their own preparations. As an athlete, getting sick is never great and if you got this virus bad you might face missing weeks of training. It could result on you missing the podium in Tokyo.? Or missing the Games altogether. Another friend of mine told me of his concerns that if they move the Games then he might not even get selected.? With markets crashing and supermarket shelves being cleared, these are definitely interesting times for everybody. But when you are living during this Covid-19 pandemic with a spinal-cord injury I guess it becomes even more daunting ï¿½?as such an injury can remove your cough and sneeze reflex. With very little core function, the thought of not being able to cough is a pretty scary proposition.? This might not sound too bad. But this virus hits elderly people hard ï¿½?and this also includes your biological age due to underlying medical conditions. So this is a scary time, and I completely feel for everyone in the same boat as me how scary this is.?I remember back to catching the flu in November last year ï¿½?I thought I was going to stop breathing. I couldnât cough to clear my lungs as the level of my injury is right at the nerves which go to the lungs.? It knocked me out for weeks, so I would be lying if I said I wasnât slightly scared of Covid-19 and its possible effects on my lungs.? I am a very optimistic person who always looks for solutions over problems. But I must admit this has got me a little bit shaken.? Watching whatâs happening in Italy has been hard to believe ï¿½?particularly as life seemed to be continuing almost as normal here.? I looked at the MRI of a 44-year-old manâs lungs and it was unbelievable, unfortunately he didnât survive.? So I am staying positive but also taking advice from Austrian neurologist Viktor Frankl.?He speaks of acceptance of your current situation. These are his own words ï¿½?which I have had on my wall for the last four years: âThe meaning of life lies in finding a purpose and taking responsibility for ourselves and other human beings.ï¿½? In other words, by having a clear âwhyï¿½?we can face all the âhowï¿½?questions of life. This has got me through all those hours in hospital and continues to serve me daily.? Thereâs a reason that in-flight safety presentations always instruct us to secure our own oxygen masks before assisting fellow passengers. We canât help others effectively unless we first protect ourselves. So I spoke with a medical oncologist friend and they advised me to self-isolate.? I am now on day four and thinking this could be a long road ahead; thankfully the weather is getting warmer and I got out on my bike for a few laps of Richmond Park. Along with indoor turbo sessions I am well prepared mentally for the process. I guess all my time in hospital equipped my mind to deal with self-isolating. It also probably helps being an introvert.? I canât help but think of the poor people undergoing their cancer treatment right now though, as I prepare for my own hospital appointment in a few weeks, but I am grateful that side of things is under control. My main goal is keeping my immune system strong because another issue I have from my spinal-cord injury is a compromised immune system, thus moving me into a vulnerable group.? Itâs hard to go from a strong athlete to now feeling so vulnerable, but thankfully I have a strong mind."

The media piously condemns Vladimir Putin's propaganda machine, and justifiably so, yet it seems blind to how it has blocked reporting on Biden Inc. The quarantining of valid, important news stories by the media here borders on propaganda. I predict the media will seriously examine the Biden family influence-peddling schemes late next yearâif the president's poll numbers haven't budged and he's showing a determination to run for re-election. The powers that be will then rediscover this scandal to get the president to re-examine his decision. Fred Van Bennekom Bolton, Mass. Some Republicans are arguing that this scandal, finally acknowledged by the New York Times, proves the 2020 election was ""rigged."" It would be unfortunate if this idea were used to support the dangerous view pushed by former President Donald Trump that he won the 2020 election. There's no doubt that the failure to pursue the disclosures in Mr. Biden's laptop was the most egregious example of media bias in our history. It very likely tilted the 2020 election to President Biden. The information on the laptop suggests he was profiting from his son's business dealings. Still, this is only another example of the media's alignment with the Democratic Partyâa flaw in our democracy, to be sure, but not different in kind from the obstacles Republicans face in every election.

As detailed below, the lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) that the technical report for Gatos's primary mine, the Cerro Los Gatos deposit, contained certain errors; (2) that, among other things, the mineral reserves had been overestimated by as much as 50%; and (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. In October 2020, Gatos conducted its IPO, selling approximately 24,644,500 shares of common stock at a price of $7.00 per share. On January 25, 2022, after the market closed, Gatos Silver revealed that ""there were errors in the technical report entitled âLos Gatos Project, Chihuahua, Mexico' with an effective date of July 1, 2020 . . . , as well as indications that there is an overestimation in the existing resource model."" On a preliminary basis, the Company estimates a potential reduction of the metal content of the mineral reserve ranging from 30% to 50% of the metal content remaining after depletion. On this news, the Company's stock price fell $7.02, or 69%, to close at $3.17 per share on January 26, 2022, on unusually heavy trading volume.

808,0,Money and the disinformation machine,1056 words,The Straits Times,"In recent days, several well-known musicians have protested against Spotify's enormously popular podcast The Joe Rogan Experience, in which Rogan has irresponsibly promoted ivermectin, used to treat parasitic infections, as a Covid-19 treatment and protested against vaccine requirements. And when his guests have offered up gobs of bad information about Covid and vaccine efficacy, he has offered up too little pushback. After hundreds of medical experts signed an open letter to Spotify denouncing such disinformation, singer Neil Young issued an ultimatum to Spotify: ""They can have Neil Young or Rogan. Not both."" Joni Mitchell soon followed, as did others such as Spotify podcaster Brene Brown, who vowed not to release new episodes of her shows Unlocking Us and Dare To Lead. Rather than give in to critics, Spotify has held its ground and, in recent days, most of Young's and Mitchell's music has been pulled from its library. The service said suppressing or editing Rogan's podcast would amount to censorship - but anyone who has paid attention to online content moderation knows that is a charade.  Facebook, in particular, has trotted out that excuse time and again when it ought to have blocked or removed content or users. Don't be fooled. Peer just beneath the surface and it becomes clear that for big social media companies, matters of ""censorship"" are always matters of business. Facebook, for example, has had special exemptions from its rules for the very people who are most likely to be believed: politicians and celebrities. More such speech, more advertising revenue.  Facebook, Twitter and YouTube remove content posted by regular folks every day with no apparent worries about grand matters of free speech. Removing accounts by former president Donald Trump and, more recently, Congressman Marjorie Taylor Greene after repeated and flagrant policy violations was done only when it became a business imperative. If, as Spotify implies, Rogan's views offend its sensibilities, there ought to be nothing to prevent the service from scaling his podcast back. As the exclusive rights holder for the podcast, it has more control over and responsibility for Rogan's content than do social media companies over users who post Covid-19 misinformation. But Spotify paid dearly for Rogan's podcast, a reported US$100 million (S$135 million), and the will of two rockers past their prime and a few others, does not - from a business perspective - outweigh Rogan's 11 million regular listeners. Rogan has expressed contrition and vowed to more carefully vet his guests. Spotify, for its part, said it will post warning labels on his content and that of others directly discussing Covid-19. But that is all window dressing.  Twitter's and Facebook's experiments with warning labels and links to authoritative sources proved unable to stop the spread of misinformation during the 2020 election and haven't been effective in culling similarly dangerous ideas in the pandemic. More On This Topic Spotify to link virus content to Covid-19 facts after disinformation row Medical professionals urge Spotify to crack down on Covid-19 misinformation In a Sunday blog post that did not include any mention of Rogan or his podcast, Spotify's chief executive Daniel Ek appears to take a strong stance against violations of the service's rules. Still, he resisted calls to take more muscular action. ""There are plenty of individuals and views on Spotify that I disagree with strongly,"" he wrote. ""We have a critical role to play in supporting creator expression while balancing it with the safety of our users. In that role, it is important to me that we don't take on the position of being content censor."" Whatever Spotify executives' true feelings about Rogan or the pandemic, Mr Ek is really playing defence for his cash cow - and if he gives in on this issue, he will have to give in on the next one. Given an opening, there is no shortage of customers and artistes who would be thrilled to pressure the company to remove content from Mr Barack Obama and his wife Michelle's production company, which has its own exclusive deal with Spotify. Losing Mitchell is a shame, but losing Rogan or Mr Obama would be terrible for business. Mr Barack Obama and his wife Michelle's production company has its own exclusive deal with Spotify. PHOTO: REUTERS Investors have rewarded the strategy. Shares of Spotify rose more than 15 per cent after Young's music started being taken off the service last week. (Its shares dropped midweek after weaker-than-expected first-quarter subscriber numbers). The company's shares fell as much as 18 per cent in late trading after Spotify reported the subscriber outlook, even amid what was the worst start to the year in more than a decade for the broader market. Mr Ek's blog post laid out the company's rules of the road, but Spotify knew exactly who Rogan was when it signed its exclusive deal with him nearly two years ago. Before reaching the deal, Rogan had belittled transgender people, given airtime to conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and once likened a movie theatre in a predominantly black neighbourhood to Planet Of The Apes. Spotify knew what it was getting with Rogan. If its ""longstanding platform rules"" truly mattered or were being applied consistently, you would expect Rogan to have already been dealt with. Where the rubber meets the road for Spotify is a market backlash, a principled stance from bigger names like Taylor Swift, or a slew of artists, not the trickle we have seen so far. So, for now, Rogan is untouchable and our health is at risk.

126,0,McDonald's super-fan handcuffs himself to doors of Moscow restaurant in protest after the chain said it would close in Russia as some outlets remain OPEN across country,1200 words,Mail Online,"* McDonald's still serving food across Russia despite chain saying it would quit * Restaurants in Moscow, Volgograd, Novosibirsk and Ufa were open on Monday A McDonald's super-fan was arrested and fined in Moscow after chaining himself to the front of a restaurant to protest it closing amid the invasion of Ukraine. Luka Safronov-Zatravkin, a pianist and son of famous Russian artist Nikas Safronov, said it was 'inhumane' of McDonald's to close - telling Russian media: 'It was my way of life, it was my freedom, they decided that they could limit me.'  McDonald's announced what it called a 'temporary closure' of all 850 restaurants last week, and while it did not give an exact date for the closure it was widely assumed the move would happen at the end of the week. The Russian shut-down - during which McDonald's says it will continue paying its 62,000 staff and continue charitable operations - is expected to cost the company roughly $50million-per-month. But Russians were still able to buy McDonald's in cities across the country today despite the American chain announcing its plans to suspend all operations in Russia. Fast food fans in Moscow, St Petersburg, Volgograd, Novosibirsk and Ufa were seen queuing for burgers on Monday afternoon as restaurants there continued to operate - almost a week after McDonald's said it was quitting the country. Restaurants in Moscow, St Petersburg, Volgograd and Novosibirsk were still serving food on Monday. In the oil-city Ufa, the chain explained it would suspend operations by the end of today. Elsewhere diners were told that outlets would close only after running down stocks of popular foods. Unlike other fast food businesses in Russia such as KFC and Pizza Hut , which are owned in franchise agreements, McDonald's owns the majority of its restaurants meaning it is liable to take the hit. Many of the open burger outlets were almost empty because Russians had expected them to be closed. RIA Novosti reported that some outlets were remaining open today while they 'complete production processes'. Russian politicians have threatened to nationalise the assets of Western firms pulling out of Russia.  McDonald's first opened in the Soviet Union in 1990 in Moscow's Red Square, as people queued to get a taste of Western food as the Iron Curtain was lowered. A potent symbol of American soft economic power, it is now one of a series of high-profile brands to exit Russia amid outcry over Putin's attack on Ukraine. Explaining the decision last week, CEO Chris Kempczinski said the 'needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine' had prompted him to act.  Starbucks , Pepsi, Microsoft , Coca-Cola , and Burger King are among 300 highly recognisable Western brands that have also quit Russia. It comes as Western governments strangle the Russian economy with sanctions, target Putin's inner circle, and hit the country's lucrative oil and gas exports in an effort to pressure him into ending the war. Russian authorities, facing potential economic calamity as Western sanctions take hold, have threatened foreign companies hoping to withdraw from the country with arrests and asset seizures, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday. Russian prosecutors have issued warnings to several foreign entities - via calls, letters and in-person visits - including to Coca-Cola , McDonald's , Procter & Gamble , IBM and Yum Brands , the parent company of KFC and Pizza Hut , according to the business daily, citing sources familiar with the matter. They have threatened to arrest officials who have criticized the government or to seize assets, including intellectual property. 'The warnings have prompted at least one of the targeted companies to limit communications between its Russian business and the rest of the company, out of concern that emails or text messages among colleagues may be intercepted, some of the people (familiar with the matter) said,' according to the Wall Street Journal. The Russian embassy in the United States on Sunday dismissed the report as 'fake'. 'We urge local media to abandon the vicious practice of spreading fake news. The Wall Street Journal opus is pure fiction,' it said on Facebook . It added that the decision to continue business activities in Russia 'is entirely up to the Americans.' Russia has faced unprecedented sanctions imposed by Western governments after the invasion of Ukraine, with a growing list of companies announcing their withdrawals from the country or their plans to suspend activities there. Russian authorities have boosted efforts to prevent money from leaving its borders and to support the ruble, which has already seen a precipitous drop in value against the dollar. Without using the word 'nationalization,' Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he is in favor of appointing 'external' administrators to head such foreign companies in Russia 'in order to transfer them to those who want to make them work.' The prosecutor's office on Friday meanwhile ordered 'strict control' of companies that had announced a suspension of their activities in Russia, warning especially of increased monitoring of labor legislation compliance, under penalty of prosecution.  Coca-Cola , McDonald's , Procter & Gamble and Yum Brands did not respond to requests for comments by AFP Sunday. Meanwhile European Union diplomats on Monday agreed to add Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich to the EU list of Russian billionaires sanctioned after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, two diplomatic sources said on Monday. The informal greenlight to Abramovich's listing came in a meeting on Sunday, one source said, and the EU envoys will reconvene at 1100 GMT on Monday to adopt the measure and a further set of economic sanctions against Russia. Sanctions will be effective only after publication on the EU 's official journal, which usually happens within hours or the day following formal approval. The West has sanctioned Russian billionaires, frozen state assets and cut off much of the Russian corporate sector from the global economy in an attempt to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to change course on Ukraine. In what would be the fourth package of EU sanctions against Russia since its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, the 27-nation bloc will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia, including expensive cars. It will also prohibit the import of Russian steel and iron products, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday. At Sunday's meeting, diplomats asked the Commission, which drafted the economic sanctions, to explain some aspects of the new economic measures to make sure they cannot be successfully challenged in EU courts, according to two EU sources. No concerns were raised about the new listings of oligarchs and businessmen, which are in a separate legal document drafted by the EU external action service, one diplomat said, noting that Abramovich's listing 'will go through'. Further Russian oligarchs will be added to the EU list. Dozens have already been sanctioned."

600,0,"Government begins preparations for full closure of on-premises restaurants - entry into force ""three to four weeks"" away*** TRANSLATED ***",458 words,STT,"According to LintilÃ¤, the closure would apply to high-risk restaurants if it were introduced. These include bars, nightclubs and pubs. According to the minister, the government is very united that low-risk restaurants should not be subject to further restrictions. The Department of Health and Welfare(THL) has classified, for example, bars, pubs and nightclubs as high-risk events for corona infections. On the other hand, according to the department, food and staff restaurants are places with a low risk of infection. The closure is not coming true immediately. - It will probably talk about a three- to four-week timeline, because then Parliament will decide the law in due course, LintilÃ¤ said. The support pot could be over 200 million Among other things, it was announced at the event that the government is preparing a closure fee and a new round of cost subsidies for companies affected by various corona measures. The closure compensation would currently apply, for example, to sports and sports facilities that have been closed by an official decision. The cost support for companies subject to less restrictive restrictions would be the sixth in a row. There is also an event guarantee under construction that would allow for the planning of summer events. At the moment, Finland could only grant the guarantee until the end of June, but according to LintilÃ¤, the government intends to apply to the European Commission for permission to extend the guarantee until the end of September. In order to finance the support measures, the government is submitting an amending budget to Parliament at the beginning of February, when the government will also submit its bill on the matter. According to LintilÃ¤, the exact size of the compensation will only be decided when the duration of the various closures and restrictions is specified. He said tentatively that the total amount of aid could be between ï¿½?200 and ï¿½?250 million. - This is very difficult to assess, because the compensation for companies, events and event organizers is compensated in proportion to how they have had events and which days the companies have been covered by the closures, LintilÃ¤ said. *** DISCLAIMER: THIS IS AN AUTOMATED TRANSLATION FROM FINNISH ***"
631,0,"UPDATE 1-Google, Meta face penalties in Russia as deadline passes to open local offices",659 words,Reuters News,"March 1 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc are among internet companies facing possible punitive measures in Russia after failing to open local offices and take other measures required by a communications law. Since July 2021, Russian legislation signed by President Vladimir Putin has obliged foreign social media companies with more than 500,000 daily users to open local offices or be subject to restrictions as severe as outright bans. The new rules also require companies to register with Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor and have a system for fielding user complaints. In November, Roskomnadzor listed 13 companies it wanted to set up officially on Russian soil. Last month, it said it would start imposing restrictions by the end of February. Ahead of the March deadline, only a few had complied. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last week, Western governments have urged companies to push back on Putin in any way possible. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a âspecial operation.ï¿½? Apple Inc and Spotify Technology SA had fully complied before fighting began in Ukraine. On Monday, Roskomnadzor's website showed Rakuten Group Inc's messaging app Viber had completed all required steps. Six other companies had fulfilled at least one policy but had not established a Russian legal entity or local office. Those were Google, Meta, Twitter Inc, ByteDance's TikTok, Zoom Video Communications Inc, JOYY Inc's video app Likee, the government website https://236-fz.rkn.gov.ru/agents/list[https://236-fz.rkn.gov.ru/agents/list] showed late Monday. Meta had been in ""protracted discussions"" with the Russian regulator up until the invasion of Ukraine occurred, Nick Clegg, Meta's head of global affairs, said during a press call on Tuesday. Clegg said Meta sought to comply with the law ""where we feel we can in good conscience do so,"" but added there were other provisions the company felt were difficult to understand. Four companies - chat tool Discord, Amazon.com Inc's live streaming unit Twitch, messaging app Telegram and bookmarking service Pinterest Inc - had taken no steps to comply, according to the website. Likee said its Feb. 16 filing to form a Russian legal entity was under review and it plans to comply with the law. Twitter declined to comment. The other 11 companies did not respond to requests for comment. Last month, Roskomnadzor said it would begin barring non-compliant companies from selling ads in Russia. It previously has said blocking access to the targeted services would be a last resort, and other penalties could include limiting data collection and money transfers. The regulation is a part of a wider campaign for internet control that critics say threatens individual and corporate freedom. Authorities in Russia have issued small fines to social media companies for ignoring demands to censor anti-government activists or information. Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation,"" has curtailed access to Facebook in recent days in retaliation for the platform's censoring state media services, which critics say promote fake news and propaganda. Twitter has also been slow to access on mobile devices. Demand has surged in Russia during the crackdown for virtual private networking (VPN) apps, which can help with circumventing internet restrictions. Three of the top five most downloaded apps on Apple's App Store on Monday were VPNs. They generated a combined 383,000 installs over the past seven days, 15 times more than the prior seven-day period, according to estimates from tracker Sensor Tower. Russia, with a population of about 144 million, had nearly 51 million users on Instagram and 7.5 million on Facebook as of last November, according to research outfit Insider Intelligence.

That was down from $1.75 billion, or $4.10, a year ago, but EPS topped Wall Streetâs estimates of $2.44 to $3.20 per share. First-quarter 2022 profit included BBVA integration costs of $31 million pretax. Total revenue for the three months ended March 31 was $4.692 billion, up 11% from first-quarter 2021. Financial analysts expected PNCâs revenue to range from $4.61 billion to $5.04 billion, or an average of $4.76 billion. Asked about the commercial real estate market and the looming risk that tenants presently abiding by lease terms may ultimately not renew because they donât need as much space due to continuing flexible work arrangements that emerged during the pandemic, Demchak was direct. âThatâs one of our fears,ï¿½?he said. âI think weâre going to see that weakness in office properties flow through over a longer period of time and by the way, thatâs very market-specific. For example, in Pittsburgh, I think weâre going to struggle with that. Interestingly, we donât have a lot of exposure here but, practically, I think there are going to be less people in buildings in Pittsburgh, and I think thatâs going to be the case in many metros around the country.ï¿½?He believes that will cause lease rates to drop over time, in turn affecting office properties. âWeâre served for that, weâre watching that,ï¿½?he said. âWe pick our clients carefully and, at this point, we think most, if not all of them, have the wherewithal to make their way through this.ï¿½?Near the callâs conclusion, Demchak was asked about PNC Global Transfers Inc., a BBVA unit PNC rebranded last summer that enables it to capitalize on the cross-border payment industry and better serve corporate clients doing business in Mexico, Central America, South America and the Caribbean. âWeâve been very happy, and it has expanded,ï¿½?Demchak said. âWeâre looking to expand it, through relationships, into other countries and, I think, into Europe, although Iâm not certain. Itâs dependent on corresponding banking relationships in receiving countries. Itâs a big business ï¿½?we white-label it for others. Itâs now mainstream on our consumer apps, and weâre looking at some of that functionality to be tied into some of the things that weâre actually doing on the consumer side.ï¿½?PNC Global Transfers offers third-party license money transmitters and other financial institutions access to an integrated API solution that connects the originating clients to multiple payment networks in the aforementioned regions, providing fast, secure and reliable real-time delivery of funds with positive payment notification.

See details,342 words,Mint,"The restrictions have been extended keeping in view the Covid-19 situation in the state, a notification issued by the chairman of the State Disaster Management Authority said. Additionally, parks, swimming pools, gymnasiums, zoos, places of tourist interest, stadiums and educational institutions shall remain closed till January 31.

217,1,Ex-cops in Rio culture clean,428 words,The West Australian,"It is understood the company has secured the services of former senior police officers and other investigators in Perth and Brisbane, boosting the numbers of the business conduct office team for the Asia-Pacific region to 15. The recent recruitment round is believed to have been prompted by an increase in reports to the My Voice program, as employees have become accustomed to new reporting processes. The business conduct office now reports to Isabelle Deschamps, Rioâs chief legal and external affairs officer. She took up her role in November last year. Reports to Rioâs 14-month-old My Voice program, for employees to report misconduct and poor behaviour, have increased as the program has become more established. No one from the company was available for interview this week about the recruitment effort. But it is also understood the hiring of case investigators is designed to support Rioâs aim of providing a âcaring responseï¿½?to workplace incidents ï¿½?a key point for further work from its January report. The investigation was conducted by former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick, pictured. Rio in accepting Ms Broderickâs report committed to its 26 recommendations, which it has said it is using to improve its responses to discrimination and poor workplace behaviour. Despite experts and other companies lauding Rio for releasing its landmark report publicly, and hoping that other companies would follow suit, they are yet to do so. But according to evidence heard at the WA inquiry into sexual misconduct on mine sites, prompted by The West Australianâs reporting, poor and often criminal behaviour is widespread within the industry. Job advertisements for Rioâs roles state the company is expecting its new investigation recruits to monitor internal trends to âcontinuously improve our employeesï¿½?experience during workplace investigationsï¿½? Successful candidates are expected to know how to âprepare complex investigation reports to a high standardï¿½?and âcreate an environment where employees can be their bestï¿½? They are also expected to have âsignificant experience using a human-centric approach to investigate and manage complex and sensitive workplace mattersï¿½?and working in a collaborative manner to achieve âreasonable and fair outcomesï¿½?"
442,1,NMDC coasting along on spree of price hikes,464 words,Mint,"Earlier this month, NMDC disclosed (provisional) physical performance for the year. The company ended FY22 on a strong note, with annual production and sales of 42.15 million tonne (MT) and 40.70MT. ""This records the best ever annual physical performance for NMDC,"" said the company. For this fiscal year, the target is higher. In a report on 12 April, analysts from Motilal Oswal Financial Services said, ""While NMDC has guided for 46MT iron ore production in FY23, we are building in production and sales of 45MT in our estimates. In addition, our price assumption is 10% lower compared with the current price, which leaves headroom for both price and volume expansion."" The brokerage's sum-of-the-parts based target price for the NMDC stock stands at Rs.220. In comparison, shares are trading at around Rs.168 on NSE. Despite its significant gain in CY22, NMDC's shares are still 21% below the 52-week high of Rs.213.20 seen on 12 May 2021. The delay in commissioning its Nagarnar steel plant is a factor that has weighed on sentiments. NMDC will demerge the plant, which analysts believe would be a trigger for the stock. ""Demerger would improve the return ratios and enable the company to focus on the core mining business and NMDC would be supplying ~4.5MTPA of iron ore at arm's length to the demerged steel plant once the plant ramps up to full capacity,"" said a report by Antique Stock Broking.

522,0,Japan widens virus restrictions as omicron surges in cities,611 words,Financial Express Online,"Throughout the pandemic, Japan has resisted the use of lockdowns to limit the spread of the virus and has focused on requiring eateries to close early and not serve alcohol, and on urging the public to wear masks and practice social distancing, as the government seeks to minimize damage to the economy.Under the latest measure, most eateries are asked to close by 8 pm, while large events can allow full capacity if they compile anti-virus plans. Critics say the measures, which almost exclusively target bars and restaurants, make little sense and are unfair.After more than two years of repeated restraints and social distancing requests, Japanese are increasingly becoming less cooperative to such measures. People are back to commuting on packed trains and shopping at crowded stores. Japan briefly eased border controls in November but quickly reversed them to ban most foreign entrants when the omicron variant began spreading in other countries. Japan says it will stick to the stringent border policy through end of February as the country tries to reinforce medical systems and treatment. The tough border controls have triggered criticism from foreign students and scholars who say the measure is not scientific.Tokyo logged 8,638 new cases of coronavirus infection Thursday, exceeding the previous record of 7,377 set just the day before.At a Tokyo metropolitan government task force meeting, experts sounded alarm at the fast-paced upsurge led by omicron. Norio Ohmagari, Director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center of National Center for Global Health and an advisor to the Tokyo metropolitan government panel, said Tokyoâs daily new cases may exceed 18,000 within a week if the increase continues at the current pace. Though only some of the soaring number of infected people are hospitalized and occupying less than one-third of available hospital beds in the Japanese capital, experts say the rapid upsurge of the cases could quickly overwhelm the medical systems once the infections further spread among the elderly population who are more likely to become seriously ill.Surging infections have already begun to paralyse hospitals, schools and other sectors in some areas. The ministry has trimmed the required self-isolation period from 14 days to 10 for those who come into close contact with someone who test positive for COVID-19, and to seven days for essential workers if they test negative.While about 80% of Japanese have received their first two vaccine doses, the rollout of booster shots has been slow and has reached only 1.4 per cent of the population so far.The health ministry is set to approve inoculation for children aged 5-11 who are now increasingly vulnerable.

455,0,DoorDash dishes out grants to Boston-area restaurants,641 words,The Boston Globe,"For Morad Bouzid, owner of Mo'Rockin Fusion in Boston Public Market, the support is âa tremendous help,ï¿½?after he put a hold on growing his business when the pandemic drove workers out of downtown. He hopes to open a brick-and-mortar restaurant in the future. âWe're trying to work with what we have right now,ï¿½?said Bouzid. âSo I was actually thrilled that I was picked.ï¿½?Along with the cash, selected restaurants also will receive an eight-week curriculum with lessons on how to grow their business, one-on-one coaching, and merchandising and marketing benefits from DoorDash. The delivery apppartnered with Accion Opportunity Fund, a nonprofit small business lender, to include curriculum centered on business growth, with courses such as âFinding Your Niche and Defining Your Brand,ï¿½?âHiring & Employee Relations,ï¿½?and âMarketing Like a Pro.ï¿½?âWe focus on the areas that we know restaurant owners needed the most,ï¿½?said Tasia Hawkins, social impact program lead at DoorDash. âSo that business owners are equipped to not just have the capital to run their business, but to know what to do with that capital and deploy it in a way that will help their business grow for the long term.ï¿½?Fiex Thevenin and Denise Omarde of Cafe Juice Up in Mattapan plan to use some of the grant money to address staffing shortages. Thevenin said he hopes to form lasting connections with other program participants. âAfter the cohort is done, I hope that everyone can always maintain a relationship where information and resources can be passed along,ï¿½?he said. âThe more people that can band together, the better off we all are.ï¿½? DoorDash already has rolled out the program in five other cities over the last year, including New York and Chicago. It's part of a broader five-year, $200 million Main Street Strong Pledge to strengthen local communities and their restaurants, Hawkins said.  DoorDash and other third-party delivery services have long been criticized by some restaurants for charging up to 30 percent for commissions on orders they deliver. Those criticisms grew during the pandemic, as struggling restaurants relied on delivery to survive, and thus had to share more of their proceeds with delivery apps. John Schall, owner of El Jefe's Taqueria in Boston and Cambridge, has advocated for a 15 percent delivery fee cap since the early days of the pandemic. Last January, the Massachusetts Legislature implemented this 15 percent cap, but the provision expired in June. Since then, Schall said, delivery fees on his orders have shot back up to 25 percent of the bill. For a restaurant that depends on delivery for nearly 40 percent of its business now, the fees are âa killerï¿½?to profit margins, he said. âThere's lots of reasons why restaurants are struggling now, but this is certainly one of them,ï¿½?said Schall. âIt's a really big percentage, and it will continue to have devastating effects on restaurants.ï¿½?Hawkins said DoorDash is âcontinually listening to merchant feedback,ï¿½?and cited its announcement in April to allow restaurants to choose partnership plans with delivery commissions starting at 15 percent. âWe're continually thinking about how to invest back into our merchants, and the Main Street Strong Accelerator is just one portion of that,ï¿½?said Hawkins."
399,0,Charles Draghi doesn't need to butter anyone up,2132 words,The Boston Globe,"To be honest, I was kind of dragging my feet a little bit in terms of finding something because, you know, with COVID, a chef with no sense of smell or taste is not really worth a lot. It's kind of like a pianist who has no use of his fingers. But [I heard] Tom Schlesinger-Guidelli was looking for somebody. I had always wanted to do sort of a fish-themed restaurant, and I've known him forever. It just seemed like a perfect fit. So I called him. I went in, and the place had such a really great vibe. I believe in the feel of a restaurant as soon as you walk in, and the feel was just very positive. The energy in everybody who worked there seemed really happy. The managers were awesome. So I just had this great vibe going in. If you know Tom, well, hospitality is in his bone marrow. He's the living embodiment of hospitality. So, you know, it's just a perfect fit. And I don't have to do a lot of the things that my own restaurant took me away from. I just basically have to focus on cooking. As somebody who's been in this industry in Boston a long time, what's going to happen to restaurants over the next year? Well, the thing that people don't really talk about that much is that it wasn't an easy business before COVID. Restaurants closed all the time, so there was that. Staffing has been nearly impossible for a long time. [At Erbaluce], we couldn't get a steady bartender. We had one in the very beginning, but it was nearly impossible to staff to begin with. And then COVID has made it so that a lot of people have taken a break. It's a cliche now, but they've taken a break and realized they don't want to stay in the restaurant business. A lot of my cooks I called to talk to, they're like, 'Well, we're making better money and better hours doing construction or driving trucks or something.' So there's that. ï¿½?Deliveries are difficult. But you know, even before COVID, a lot of my purveyors couldn't find people to drive trucks to make deliveries. COVID amplified the problems that were already there. What does all this mean for customers reading this? New restaurants are always going to open, right? Because every time a young cook gets into a kitchen, they're looking to gain experience, and they're looking to gain a client base, and hopefully some investors to open. There's always going to be investors, or people with money, who are looking to invest to have their favorite spot. And then there's always going to be new people coming in from other fields, whether they've been investment bankers, or lawyers or whatever, who have a dream of owning a restaurant. That's the problem a lot of times. Because they don't know the business, they have unrealistic expectations of the finances. So they're willing to sign leases for higher rent than they should, and higher rent than the business can sustain. So then everybody else is like, 'Well, this is the going rate.' Really, $100 a square foot? There's no way you can make that. 'Well, you know, Joe Blow is willing to pay it.' I'm like, yeah, but that's a commodities trader with a black Amex. They don't understand the business. So what does that mean for the Boston restaurant scene? To be honest with you ï¿½?I said years ago to another writer, and she thought I was crazy ï¿½?but I said, in a handful of years, Boston's going to basically be chain restaurants. You're going to have large corporate chains who can afford the rent because they have outlets in other cities with much lower rents; they can defray the cost. Do you still believe it? I think I'm a little more optimistic that the one-off or private restaurants or locally owned restaurants have a fighting chance in terms of competition. But still, the thing is the rents. It's just unrealistic, and landlords, with commercial real estate, would rather see their places sit fallow than to charge a reasonable rent. Now, when I say reasonable rent, over the last 10 or 15 years, the commercial real estate has gone up 10 times the rate of inflation. So it's much more where inflation has been going up, except for recently, but it's been an average of 1.6, under 2 percent a year. Landlords have been charging double, triple, quadruple their rents on renewals. I looked at one space when we opened our restaurant, 12 years ago, 13 years ago; it was $8,000 a month, and then it went to $45,000 a month after the 10-year lease. And then the landlord wouldn't renew for less than $65,000 a month. Well, it's impossible to pay that. That's the biggest issue: commercial real estate, and nobody can live around the city anymore. People working in restaurants used to live in Eastie. They can't anymore, so they're way down the South Shore, North Shore. The trains don't run late enough. The T closes too early. So, if you have a 2 a.m. license, you can't get your employees home. Maybe bartenders can afford an Uber but, you know, dishwashers, bus people, barbacks? They can't afford that. So that's been a problem. But that's been a problem for 35 years, since I moved to Boston. What about opening restaurants in the suburbs? I was never a big proponent of moving a restaurant to the suburbs ï¿½?You don't have an early crowd, really, and you don't have later crowd. You have that 7:30 Saturday night, and that's it. That's your seating. So trying to get people on a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday is hard, and it's done by 9. In the restaurant business, margins are so slim, that it's the pre-theater and post-theater rush. Those things pay your bills. You can actually make money. But, if you do just one giant seating where you're packed but only for an hour, it's very hard to make a living that way. You need three seatings. ï¿½?But, at the same time, it used to be people went to the suburbs because you could get cheaper rents. But now you can be a half-hour outside of the city, and they're charging rents like they're in Boston. It's not that cheap. Let's talk about butter. I was told you don't cook with butter. That's kind of been my thing for a long time. I started to ease off of butter. At my restaurant and at Marcuccio's, I cooked completely without butter. What I found was, as I eased up on the butter, all the other flavors came out more. Some people think I have this thing against butter. I love butter. I put it on my toast in the morning. But, the amounts of butter that most restaurants use, I just did away with that. And you can taste everything. The thing is, a lot of chefs will say butter is flavor, right? You hear that all the time, but what happens is the butter first mutes the flavor. It just sits on top of it. And then you have to add a lot more salt to get the flavor of the food back up over the butter. If you take a recipe and you cook it straight out, it could be the same recipe, and at the end, you put a big spoon of butter, you now have to add 5 to 10 times as much salt to get the flavor back out over the butter. So you wind up with basically salty butter with some other flavors in there. On a night off, you're going someplace to eat just for taste, you know, just because it's delicious. Where you go, invariably, is Asian restaurants, or Middle Eastern food, or Central American, or all these places along that Equatorial belt that don't use butter. It's always some cuisine that doesn't use butter at all. But yet, butter is flavor, right? You never hear a chef say, 'You know what I really love is Norwegian cuisine!' Or, you know, 'The Bavarians really have their finger on the pulse.' You don't hear that. So what are you cooking at Alcove? I'm trying to keep it simple New England. Local fishermen, local farms, and I'm taking things they already have and just amplifying them. They had a good bar burger. But now I put on the best beef in the city. It's Painted Hills. I season some beef fat and fold it into the burger with thyme and black pepper. Now it's a really juicy burger. One of the best in the city, fantastic. I'm making some small changes like that. Is it hard to go from owning a place to working for someone else? It's so easy. Because so many of the things that took me away from cooking don't exist anymore. I can just focus on the food. When you own a place, between licensing, and getting investor calls, and all that kind of stuff? Cooking was a small percentage of it. Now, I can just focus on the food. I've been working seven days. And there's a young guy there who says, 'Oh, God, you're working so much.' You have no idea how easy this is. It's like retirement. But you can only do that if you're working with somebody who has your same mindset. I couldn't work with somebody who's like, 'OK, it's all about profit. Let's get the cheapest stuff and pretend it's good.' Tom's like, 'If it costs me extra, I don't care. I want really good stuff.' We want to support local farmers; we want to support local fishermen, all stuff I've been doing forever. When I moved to Boston 35 years ago, the farmers' market was at Government Center. It was Noquochoke Farms and a guy selling used books. That was the farmers' market. I'd buy as many apples as Noquochoke could give me, and I'd buy parsnips from them, and that was it. Tom's younger than me, but he kind of grew up with that mentality. He grew up in the business. You know, I'm Italian. So anything that people use for bait normally is what we have for dinner. Like whelks. I just put them on and people are like, 'Wow, we didn't know you could eat these things.' Nobody's serving whelks. Maybe a couple places in Chinatown, but I like doing that. And Tom loves it. Most missed restaurant? Tavern Road was great; consistently great. And Louis DiBiccari was awesome. And then he had Tony Susi in there with him. You couldn't get a bad meal in there if you tried. Favorite restaurant now? I don't really go out that much. But Giulia is just ï¿½?they're always knocking it out of the park there. Best pizza in the city? That's tough, because the thing with pizza is always about the oven being hot. ... The original [Pizzeria] Regina has a coal-fired oven that gets hot enough. ... But I would say Picco, because their oven gets hot enough. Picco's good. Upper Crust is good, too, but too much garlic. Takeout Chinese? Peach Farm. I love the owners. I love what they do. It's always Peach Farm. Interview has been edited and condensed."

644,0,"UPDATE 3-Facebook-owner Meta says Ukraine's military, politicians targeted in hacking campaign",770 words,Reuters News,"Feb 28 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms said a hacking group used Facebook to target public figures in Ukraine, including prominent military officials, politicians and a journalist, as the social media company announced steps against covert influence and hacking amid Russia's ongoing invasion of its neighbor. Meta said in the last 48 hours it had separately removed a network of about 40 fake accounts, groups and pages across Facebook and Instagram that operated from Russia and Ukraine targeting people in Ukraine, for violating its rules against coordinated inauthentic behavior. A Twitter spokesperson said the company had also suspended more than a dozen accounts and blocked the sharing of several links for violating its rules against platform manipulation and spam. It said its ongoing investigation indicated the accounts originated in Russia and sought to disrupt the public conversation around the conflict in Ukraine. A spokesperson for Alphabet Inc's YouTube said it had terminated several YouTube channels, which had fewer than 90 subscribers in total, as part of its investigation into coordinated influence operations linked to Russia. In a blog post on Monday, Meta attributed the hacking efforts to a group known as Ghostwriter, which it said successfully gained access to the targets' social media accounts. Meta said the hackers attempted to post YouTube videos from the accounts portraying Ukrainian troops as weakened, including one video which claimed to show Ukrainian soldiers coming out of a forest and flying a white flag of surrender. Ukrainian cybersecurity officials said on Friday that hackers from neighboring Belarus were targeting the private email addresses of Ukrainian military personnel ""and related individuals,"" blaming a group code-named UNC1151. The U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye has previously connected the group with Ghostwriter activities. Meta's security team said it had taken steps to secure targeted accounts and had blocked the hackers' phishing domains. It declined to give the targets' names but said it had alerted users where possible. MASQUERADING AS NEWS Meta said the separate influence campaign, which used a number of fictitious personas, claimed to be based in Kyiv and ran a small number of websites masquerading as independent news outlets. These outlets published claims about the West betraying Ukraine and Ukraine being a failed state. The company said it had found links between this influence network and an operation it removed in April 2020, which it had connected to individuals in Russia, the Donbass region in Ukraine and two media outlets based in Crimea: NewsFront and SouthFront, now sanctioned by the U.S. government. SouthFront said it had been banned by Facebook at least four times before, that its team is not in Crimea and that its coverage aims to be objective. NewsFront did not respond to a request for comment. In a news briefing, Meta declined to specific numbers give but said the influence campaign's content had seen a ""very low level"" of shares, posts or reactions. It said the campaign had fewer than 4,000 Facebook accounts following one or more of its pages and fewer than 500 accounts following its Instagram accounts. It did not say how long the campaigns had been active on its platforms. Meta said the campaign had also used Twitter, YouTube, Telegram and Russian social media sites Odnoklassniki and VK. Telegram and VK, which also owns Odnoklassniki, did not respond to requests for comment. The crisis in Ukraine has seen escalating clashes between Moscow and major tech companies. On Friday, Russia said it would partially restrict access to Facebook, a move Meta said came after it refused a government request to stop the independent fact-checking of several Russian state media outlets. On Saturday, Twitter also said its service was being restricted for some Russian users. Ukraine has been buffeted by digital intrusions and denial-of-service actions both in the run-up to and during the Russian invasion, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"". Several big tech companies have announced measures to bolster the security and privacy of their users in the country. Meta, which has in recent days made changes, such as disabling searches and viewing of the friends lists of Facebook accounts in Ukraine, said on Monday it was also making this change in Russia in response to public reports of civil society and protesters being targeted.

903,0,An Open Letter to YouTube's CEO From the World's Fact-Checkers,1178 words,AllAfrica,"What we do not see is much effort by YouTube to implement policies that address the problem. On the contrary, YouTube is allowing its platform to be weaponised by unscrupulous actors to manipulate and exploit others, and to organise and fundraise themselves. Current measures are proving insufficient. That is why we urge you to take effective action against disinformation and misinformation, and to elaborate a roadmap of policy and product interventions to improve the information ecosystem - and to do so with the world's independent, non-partisan fact-checking organisations. In the last year we have seen conspiracy groups thriving and collaborating across borders, including an international movement that started in Germany, jumped to Spain and spread through Latin America[https://chequeado.com/investigaciones/the-international-scheme-of-doctors-for-the-truth-a-denialist-trademark-registered-by-natalia-prego/], all on YouTube. Meanwhile, millions of other users were watching videos in Greek and Arabic that encouraged them to boycott vaccinations[https://www.ellinikahoaxes.gr/2020/10/18/fuellmich-video-with-false-coronavirus-info/] or treat their Covid-19 infections with bogus[https://fatabyyano.net/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%82%d8%b1%d9%86%d9%81%d9%84_%d8%a7%d8%b3%d8%aa%d9%86%d8%b4%d8%a7%d9%82_%d9%83%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%88%d9%86%d8%a7_%d9%81%d9%8a%d8%b1%d9%88%d8%b3%d8%a7%d8%aa/] cures[https://fatabyyano.net/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a8%d9%82%d8%af%d9%88%d9%86%d8%b3-%d9%81%d9%8a-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d9%86%d8%b2%d9%84-%d8%b5%d9%8a%d8%af%d9%84%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%b4%d8%a8%d9%87-%d9%85%d8%aa%d9%83%d8%a7%d9%85%d9%84%d8%a9/]. Beyond Covid-19, YouTube videos have been promoting false cures for cancer[https://www-washingtonpost-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lifestyle/style/they-turn-to-facebook-and-youtube-to-find-a-cure-for-cancer--and-get-sucked-into-a-world-of-bogus-medicine/2019/06/25/6df3ddae-7cdc-11e9-a5b3-34f3edf1351e_story.html] for years. In Brazil, the platform has been used to amplify hate speech against vulnerable groups[https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/lupa/2021/10/18/verificamos-mst-casas-santa-cruz-do-capibaribe/], reaching tens of thousands of users. Elections are not safe either. In the Philippines, false content with over 2 million views denying human rights abuses and corruption during the Martial law years[https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/youtube-unclear-policies-allow-lies-thrive-online-on-ground] are being used to burnish the reputation of the late dictator's son, one of the candidates in the 2022 elections. In Taiwan, the last election was marred by unsubstantiated accusations[https://tfc-taiwan.org.tw/articles/4204] of fraud. The whole world witnessed the consequences of disinformation when a violent mob assaulted the US Capitol. From the eve of the US presidential election to the day after, YouTube videos supporting the ""fraud"" narrative were watched more than 33 million times[https://transparency.tube/narratives/?end=2020-11-04T23%3A00%3A00.000Z&start=2020-11-02T23%3A00%3A00.000Z]. The examples are too many to count. Many of those videos and channels remain online today, and they all went under the radar of YouTube's policies, especially in non-English speaking countries and the Global South. We are glad that the company has made some moves to try to address this problem lately, but based on what we see daily on the platform, we think these efforts are not working - nor has YouTube produced any quality data to prove their effectiveness. Your company platform[https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/tackling-misinfo/] has so far framed discussions about disinformation as a false dichotomy of deleting or not deleting content. By doing this, YouTube is avoiding the possibility of doing what has been proven to work: our experience as fact-checkers together with academic evidence[https://bpspsychub-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjop.12383] tells us that surfacing fact-checked information is more effective than deleting content. It also preserves freedom of expression while acknowledging the need for additional information to mitigate the risks of harm to life, health, safety and democratic processes. And given that a large proportion[https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/youtube-recommendations-tips-tricks-limit/] of views on YouTube come from its own recommendation algorithm, YouTube should also make sure it does not actively promote disinformation to its users or recommend content coming from unreliable channels. With all this in mind, we propose some solutions that would make a great deal of difference in reducing the dissemination of disinformation and misinformation on YouTube. A commitment to meaningful transparency about disinformation on the platform: YouTube should support independent research about the origins of the different misinformation campaigns, their reach and impact, and the most effective ways to debunk false information. It should also publish its full moderation policy regarding disinformation and misinformation, including the use of artificial intelligence and which data powers it. Beyond removing content for legal compliance, YouTube's focus should be on providing context and offering debunks, clearly superimposed on videos or as additional video content. That only can come from entering into a meaningful and structured collaboration taking the responsibility and systematically investing in independent fact-checking efforts around the world that are working to solve these issues. Acting against repeat offenders that produce content that is constantly flagged as disinformation and misinformation, particularly those monetising that content on and outside the platform, notably by preventing its recommendation algorithms from promoting content from such sources of misinformation. Extend current and future efforts against disinformation and misinformation in languages different from English, and providing country- and language-specific data, as well as transcription services that work in any language. We hope you will consider implementing these ideas for the public good and to make YouTube a platform that truly does its best to prevent disinformation and misinformation being weaponised against its users and society at large. We are ready and able to help YouTube. We wish to meet with you to discuss these matters and find ways forward on a collaboration and look forward to your response to this offer.

670,1,"EXCLUSIVE: Pitch market ignites, defensive plays on the rise",1003 words,AdNews,"For Australia, consultancy R3 reported total new business up 50% [https://www-adnews-com-au.proxy.library.nyu.edu/news/new-business-pitch-league-february-2022] to $US15.9 million for media and creative agencies in February 2022 compared to the same month last year.  Publicis Media's head of new business, Helena Snowdon, confirmed the pace is continuing in Q1 2022 with ""higher activity"" than normal. ""This could be for the simple reason that clients who held off pitching their business during 20/21 in the interests of stability now want to get stuck in,"" she told Adnews. ""There has been an increased proportion of defensive pitches. Why? Marketers want more than ever to be convinced they have absolutely the right team and model to deliver against all odds."" This is Flow CEO Jimmy Hyett reported similar momentum in the independent agency landscape, with the business seeing a 285% YOY increase in pitch requests over the last 12 months. Hyett said demand has seen existing and even competitive agencies wanting to collaborate with media partners. ""Many new relationships have been forged through creative, content and PR agencies, but now we're seeing the most progressive media agencies form alliances too, referring business where clients don't fit either through conflicts, resourcing or services. These partnerships are driving mutual growth benefits, alongside incredible client results thanks to a combination of all the best agency partners working as one."" Resourcing pressure has led to 'smarter' pitching choices for agencies, according to Hyett. ""Thanks to the industry wide talent shortage, this has enabled us to pause and ask the question ï¿½?is this new business right for us? Previously any opportunity was considered a good opportunity, but now to preserve the talent, clients and really harness a thriving culture, we're now making more strategic decisions to only pitch with client partners that make strong commercial and cultural sense. ""This has led to better, more positive, productive and profitable relationships, resulting in a long-term benefit that's felt throughout our whole organisation."" This year, media agencies have also reported an increase in tender documents requiring questions around Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Environmental Social Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I). Snowdon said on DE&I, Publicis is asked about its Reconciliation Action Plan and Equal Opportunity Employment. ""The cost push agencies have suffered for too long is being replaced by a welcome priority focus on quality, contemporary, connected thinking. It's also about clients wanting to be, and being seen to be, better partners."" Mindshare Sydney MD Kate O'Ryan-Roeder confirmed the change to pitch briefs in 2022. ""Sure, fees and rates are always a factor but increasingly, we're seeing and welcoming pitch briefs that speak to the importance of values alignment between client and agency,"" she said. ""Aligned with that, we're seeing the rising prominence of ESG factors within pitch briefs, whether that is sustainability, a focus on DE&I, or beyond. As an agency passionately committed to Good Growth, we've been excited and energised by some of the pitch briefs we've already seen in market this year. ""And lastly, whilst data and tech capabilities are not new on pitch briefs, the proof is now in the pudding. Clients are asking agencies to show them how we can bring their data ambitions to life. Being able to craft and implement sustainable and future-proofed data and technology strategies carries a lot of weight, and will swing a pitch decision in 2022."" For Carat Sydney MD Lauren Small, the focus on DE&I and the return of physical pitching stands out this year. ""We're really seeing DE&I come to the forefront in pitches this year, and in a more holistic and rigorous fashion. DE&I now extends well beyond a few RFI questions hidden amongst rows of nitty gritty media information, and so it should. ""As for being back in a room in person with real humans, there's nowhere I'd rather be. The energy and the experience are game changing when face to face, and it's something I've dearly missed in these last two years of mostly virtual pitching. This isn't to say we didn't learn a lot from pitching virtually, from accessibility, to breaking down borders and democratising the pitch experience, it's now about finding the balance between the two modes - that's the sweet spot."" At Archibald Williams, head of client and strategic services Kiranpreet Kaur confirmed agencies and clients are ""on the hunt again"" in Q1 2022 but urged discipline in brief documents moving forward. ""We're still seeing long, detailed forms for submission, and at times they feel incredibly redundant and unnecessary. I recently saw one asking for a quick turnaround on full campaign strategy concepts and campaign ideas, along with the usual RFP documents. ""Now, many people would say, ""that's normal"" and ""we'll make it work"". Yes, we're agencies, and of course, we can but post-pandemic self-reflection has made agency employees and employers question whether we should. ""On the flip side, I recently saw a client with a simple list of five questions ï¿½?clear and to the point, almost like a speed date before it got more serious. A far more efficient approach to inviting and filtering candidates. ""There's no denying that the hunger and hustle from agencies hasn't changed. We will give it our all, but it's a shame to put agencies through the wringer before even starting the relationship. ""It all comes down to respect. The submission form for any pitch is a strong reflection of how a client foresees the dynamic of respect in the future, and we need to start pushing this as a barometer more."""

""Customers responded well to our Winter Sale held in the first few weeks of the quarter, with a very strong sales performance across most categories. We have continued to refresh our product ranges, with our new 'Summer Living' products performing particularly well during March, as customers looked to ready their homes and gardens for summer."" ""Gross margin in the third quarter increased by 30bps compared to the same period last year, and was better than expected due to a slightly lower proportion of sales from discounted lines during our Winter Sale. We continue to work closely with our committed suppliers to take actions to mitigate significant raw materials and freight cost increases. The outlook remains dynamic, and we continue to monitor gross margins closely. ""Given the robust margin performance in the year to date and the expected impact of the non-like-for-like Summer Sale in the fourth quarter, we anticipate gross margin for the full year FY22 will be broadly similar to FY21.""

""Performance has been strong across all channels and our new facilities for e-commerce and furniture fulfilment are now fully operational, which will enhance our multi-channel proposition, whilst providing the capacity for further growth. ""Whilst the macro environment remains uncertain, with significant headwinds and increasing pressures on the consumer, our wide product range offers choice for every budget, whether replacing everyday essential items or refreshing a room in your home. The resilience of the Dunelm business model and the ability of our colleagues to adapt quickly to changing circumstances give us confidence in our plans and we remain well placed to continue to grow market share."""
670,0,"Pakistan's Dunya TV show discusses domestic politics, PM's Russia visit",1235 words,BBC Monitoring South Asia,"Anchor Kamran Khan remarked that the government last week took a major step to curb media freedom and ""introduced a draconian law through an ordinance"". He mentioned that the ordinance has been challenged in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) by the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) and the Court today [23 February] restrained the government from arresting people under this ordinance. He mentioned that the attorney general has termed the ordinance ""a draconian law in its present shape"" and the MQM [Muttahida Qaumi Movement], a party in alliance with the government, has also demanded that this ordinance should be repealed. Khan spoke with senior journalist, Mazhar Abbas, for comments. Abbas recalled that Prime Minister Imran Khan had opposed the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act [PECA] when it was passed under the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz [PML-N] government. He mentioned that the ordinance has allowed ""arrest without warrants"" and made the offence ""non-bailable"" like in acts of terrorism. He remarked that the law would be misused to suppress media freedom and added that consultations should have been held before issuing the ordinance. Success against terrorism Khan remarked that the terrorism situation has greatly improved in Pakistan and mentioned that operation Radd-ul-Fasad [an anti-terrorist operation by the Pakistani military] had been launched five years ago and it has confined terrorism in limited areas, while many areas have been cleared of terrorists and peace has been restored in the cities. He expressed the view that ""the terrorism that is still present is 100% Indian-sponsored"" and has been targeting the vulnerable areas with less security presence. Khan contacted defence analyst, former defence secretary Lt General [retired] Naeem Khalid Lodhi, and asked him why the terrorists have not been rooted out completely and that challenges are still there. Lodhi remarked ""for living nations, it is always a continuing struggle"" and ""it is particularly so for a nation like us with the name of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which has a nuclear capability and major countries are annoyed with it over what happened in Afghanistan"". He also mentioned that the development through CPEC [China Pakistan Economic Corridor] and growing closeness towards China was also a factor. He said because of these factors, ""it is not likely anytime soon that Pakistan would have a period of complete peace"". Speaking about Operation Radd-ul-Fasad, Lodhi remarked that it was a ""very intricate and difficult operation because the terrorists had entered the cities and mingled with the common citizens"". He also remarked that steps for economic development and ""political inclusivity"" were needed in the areas cleared of terrorists. He termed the prime minister's visit to China and then to Russia as welcome developments, which would help solve the Afghanistan problems and ""allow expansion of CPEC towards Central Asian countries"". No-confidence motion Khan said the opposition parties are busy finalising their strategy for a no-confidence motion against the government. He mentioned that the opposition has been claiming that it would table a no-confidence motion and would also launch a long protest march to send the government home but it ""does not seem to have a clear strategy about an early election and the interim setup"" if its vote of no-confidence is passed. Khan mentioned that on various occasions the members from the opposition have not been able to take a joint stance on the legislation. He said however, at this time, the opposition is working very seriously and thoroughly on the movement against the government. Khan spoke with Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, senior vice president of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and a former prime minister, and asked him whether the opposition now had a clear strategy. Abbasi remarked that ""it is for sure that a no-confidence motion would be moved"" however, the timing and the date have been kept confidential. On the question about whether the members of the ruling party would support the no-confidence motion, Abbasi claimed that ""24 members of the ruling party were ready to support the opposition"". Abbasi said there has been ""unconstitutional interference in our political system"" and ""this time we hope that the interference would not happen because of the public pressure"". On Khan's question about who would be the prime minister after the removal of Imran Khan from the post of prime minister, Abbasi said that after the vote of no-confidence, a fresh election should be called immediately. He made it clear that this was his personal opinion while a final decision would be taken by the top leaders. He said the PML-N has a record that it solved problems when it came in the government and remarked that after the election, a ""broad-based cooperation"" would be needed for the development and progress of the country. PM Imran Khan's Russia visit Khan remarked that relations between Pakistan and Russia have ""entered a new phase"" as Prime Minister Imran Khan is on a visit to Russia. He mentioned that the timing of the visit was being seen by the diplomatic circles as ""inappropriate"". He also mentioned that Prime Minister Khan said in an interview yesterday that he had been invited for the visit before the Ukrainian crisis had begun. He added that the prime minister also said that ""Pakistan's development remained stalled because of joining a camp"" and ""now Pakistan does not believe in camp politics"". Khan contacted Aizaz Chaudhry, former foreign secretary and the director of the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad, for his view on Pakistan-Russia relations. Chaudhry said that there was room for expanding relations further. He mentioned that Pakistan had taken a ""strategic decision"" that it will maintain relations with all major powers. He said ""Pakistan is not giving any signal regarding the Ukraine crisis"" and ""the visit is a bilateral visit"". He made it clear that ""Pakistan has not taken any position on the Ukraine crisis except that it should be solved peacefully"". He mentioned that military relations between Pakistan and Russia have been growing since 2012-13 however, little progress could be seen in economic relations. On Khan's remarks that ""practically, Pakistan has joined a camp"" and its relations with the United States were ""mere formal in nature,"" Chaudhry said Pakistan can increase people-to-people relations with the US but the security-driven relationship was no longer likely as the US has chosen India as its partner against China. He said in economic relations with Russia, the North-South gas pipeline has remained a focus area. He also mentioned that ""Russia is seemingly encouraging Central Asian states to increase trade through Pakistani ports"" and ""Pakistan can become a hub for the Eurasian landmass"" and Russia can play a key role in it ""if we took the right steps"". He remarked that the North-South pipeline would be very important in this regard. Source: Dunya News TV in Urdu 1630 gmt 23 Feb 22"
787,1,Dropped Catch: Why Wesfarmers' online marketplace is struggling,848 words,The Age - Online,"Three years and one pandemic later, Catch's growth story is looking more like a saga. Since its purchase, the business reported an inaugural full-year profit of just $1 million in 2020, before posting a $46 million loss in 2021 and a $44 million loss in the first half of fiscal 2022. And though the business' revenue started strong, in the last half it fell by 4.3 per cent. Last week, Wesfarmers announced Catch's managing director - former Amazon executive Pete Sauerborn - would depart and the business would be moved out of its Kmart division into a new data and digital arm called OneDigital. From the outside, it appears Wesfarmers is moving to restructure and hopefully stem its losses at Catch. But a key question remains: why, during a period when online shopping has seen rampant growth, is a business like Catch struggling at all? The answer, according to some familiar with the business before Wesfarmers' purchase, is an erosion of the very start-up culture lauded by Scott. Like many start-ups, Catch was tightly focused on costs and ran as a very lean business - a stance inherently at odd with a heavily corporatised, governance-focused conglomerate such as Wesfarmers. Following the purchase, a steady stream of new managers and consultants were brought in to help run the business and manage its new requirements as an entity of one of Australia's largest listed businesses. These new hires, all on respectable salaries, rapidly increased Catch's headcount and its costs, eating away at the business' bottom line. It was also, reportedly, difficult to get Wesfarmers' different divisions - the operations of which are famously kept very separate to each other - to come to the table to discuss how Catch could benefit the broader group, something that the conglomerate may now have acknowledged with the move to put Catch under OneDigital. Ben Gilbert, a veteran retail analyst with investment bank Jarden, told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald he believes one of the main challenges for Catch was pivoting the business away from its âdeal-of-the-day' focus and toward Wesfarmers' goal of it being an all-around marketplace, which could sit hand-in-hand with its similarly placed Kmart and Target department stores. ""If you look at the key ingredients for a successful marketplace, both here and offshore, its range, its price, and its delivery,"" Gilbert says. ""Catch's challenge is that it hasn't been able to push its range quite as aggressively as it's needed to, so it hasn't been front of mind in consumers' heads when they go to buy their next widget."" Gilbert also notes Wesfarmers has spent a significant amount of money on online marketing for Catch in an attempt to better scale the business, which so far hasn't translated into revenue or profit growth. And alongside the operational challenges lies the broader issue of competition. With the online retail space heating up during COVID, competitors such as Kogan, eBay and Amazon have all gained ground, each fighting for customer attention and their dollars, stunting Catch's growth efforts. Gilbert backs the company's choice to move Catch out of the Kmart Group and into the data and digital division, saying it opens the door for Catch to better leverage the strength of the rest of Wesfarmers' retail brands and potentially position the business to act as the overarching online marketplace selling goods from all of the conglomerate's flagship brands. ""Wesfarmers arguably needs a marketplace that sits above all of its brands, where it can still maintain brand integrity with a Bunnings store, a Priceline store, etcetera,"" he says. ""This move shows they're thinking now about a more of a holistic approach and how they're going to leverage the power of those brands."" ""I think that's the natural evolution for Catch."" From Wesfarmers' perspective, while Catch may have underperformed in recent years, the acquisition has been a slam dunk from a valuation perspective, with the online marketplace estimated by some analysts to be worth as much as $2 billion thanks to COVID's online shopping boom. Next week, the company will also open its first Catch fulfilment centre in NSW in an effort to meet growing customer demand. But Wesfarmers can expect to face questions about Catch at its upcoming strategy day in June, with analysts keen to know if the business has dropped the ball, or if it's just a fumble.

265,0,"On the road from Kharkiv to Dnipro: Checkpoints, guns and a resolve to fight Russians",1035 words,Washington Post.com,"Though we had been deeply invested in Kharkiv's story, as we had been based in the city since before the start of Russia's invasion, we decided there was safety in numbers and linked up with another group of journalists to drive together in two cars to Dnipro, about 140 miles to the southwest. Google Maps said it would be about a three-hour drive. Ukrainians across the country have had to consider a similar choice: stay put and risk a Russian assault, or hit the road and face unpredictable and potentially even more unsafe conditions while driving. We were fortunate to have the resources to make an exit ï¿½?an option not available to all in Kharkiv. City streets were deserted as we left Kharkiv. They had been bustling with rush-hour traffic just five days earlier. One car frantically drove around us. The driver yelled out his window that we were going too slow. Artillery strikes could still be heard in the distance. But we had grown used to that sound after four days of enduring shelling here. Apparently locals had, too. As we drove, we saw a line of more than 100 people outside a grocery store. Sheltering in basements and underground metro platforms for four days had left people desperate to restock on supplies. The booming thuds, then still seemingly far away, didn't prompt them to abandon their positions in line. We knew we should expect armed checkpoints on our journey to Dnipro, and we encountered our first one at the edge of the city center. Men dressed in military-style uniforms had set up barricades along the road and directed us to pull over. Everyone in our car was wearing a protective vest as a precaution. I was driving, so I tried to cover my vest with a scarf so as to not alarm the soldiers, who were already on edge at these checkpoints. There were four people in our car, but he asked to see just one passport. Satisfied that it was American, he let us pass. At the next one, we were all asked to show our passports and also open the trunk. It was unclear if these checkpoints were manned by members of the armed forces or civilian militia volunteers. We saw plenty of the latter walking around Kharkiv and along highways on our trip. They were dressed in street clothes while carrying firearms. We pulled off at one gas station about 90 minutes into the journey, but it was out. We were about to continue on when I noticed more than 10 men with their rifles raised crossing the street to surround our two cars. Our colleague in the other vehicle opened his door to get out, and I heard one of the men yell in Russian: ""Get in the car!"" I told the people in my car to stay still and silent. These members of a Ukrainian militia had seen one of our colleagues take a photo of a gas station sign and thought he might be documenting their movements to pass on to the Russians. Our colleagues kept their hands up while explaining the misunderstanding. When the militia members came to my car, I showed them my passport and assured them we wouldn't be photographing anything. They let us leave. The next checkpoint we encountered was friendlier. Soldiers asked our two cars to pull over to make way for a Ukrainian military vehicle passing behind us. At the center of the checkpoint, a gunman peered through his scope to ensure the truck passed through safely. Then when they saw our passports, they cheered that we were from a country that has supported Ukraine with more than $2.7 billion in military aid. One soldier raised his fist and said he was ready to ""kill Russians."" The drive continued. Many road signs had been taken down or were covered in paint ï¿½?an attempt to confuse Russian forces. On one sign, someone drew a U-turn arrow and labeled it ""Moscow."" We were able to refuel in Novomuskovsk, where life seemed surprisingly normal. Along the way, we had seen a crater left from an artillery shell. But here, just 15 miles north of Dnipro, the traffic lights still worked. There was no wait for gas or at any of the grocery stores. During this brief break in driving, I saw the updates on my phone about what had transpired in Kharkiv just after we departed. Civilian areas were devastated by Russian artillery strikes ï¿½?possibly cluster munitions, which disperse submunitions or bomblets. At least 11 people were confirmed dead, with many more injured. I then thought of all of those people who had left safety because they needed groceries. We continued to scan the reports out of Kharkiv while stuck in more than two hours of traffic for our last checkpoint. My colleagues ï¿½?one a photographer and other a video journalist ï¿½?tried to capture the scene of the road congestion to get to Dnipro. But when we finally made it to the checkpoint, the soldier asked our car to pull over. He had our license plate written down on a piece of paper. ""We heard your car was taking pictures,"" he said. I assured him that we were journalists. He asked for all of us to get out of the car so he could search it. But after a quick glance into the trunk, he let his pass, ushering us forward into Dnipro. The normally three-hour trip had taken six hours."
329,1,"(PR) GWM Invests CNY 9 billion on R&D, Focusing on New Energy and Intelligentization",537 words,PR Newswire,"Lv Wenbin, General Manager of Technology of GWM HAVAL, said that facing competition in the global market, GWM has always insisted on the concept of ""excessive investment and precise R&D"" to fulfill the diversified personalized needs of global users. Over the past years, GWM has continued to carry out precise investments in both new energy and intelligent sectors and keep launching various advanced technologies to the markets. In the new energy sector, GWM officially unveiled the L.E.M.O.N. DHT. As a highly integrated and high-efficient hybrid system, this technology is compatible with and can be equipped in both HEV and PHEV power architectures. Among them, the overall powertrain efficiency of models equipped with HEV power architectures can be improved by more than 50%. In the on-site testing, the fuel-saving rate of these models can achieve 35% to 50% compared to other fuel models. Take HAVAL JOLION HEV as an example. Supported by the L.E.M.O.N. DHT, its fuel consumption can be automatically adjusted to maximize fuel efficiency in different driving modes such as standard, sports and ECO. This function can meet users' needs in various scenarios, including urban roads, express ways and other driving conditions. In the intelligence sector, GWM launched Coffee Intelligence 2.0 and grandly unveiled a new electronic and electrical architecture and intelligent drive-by-wire chassis last year. Based on all these technological improvements, the development of Coffee Intelligence 2.0 also focuses on upgrading the intelligent driving technology and developed the NOH (Navigation On HIPilot) intelligence-assisted driving navigation system. When the system turns on, the vehicle can automatically assist the driver in lane changing, overtaking and other actions in the driving process. It can also monitor whether the driver is fatigued, unable to concentrate or in other conditions, reflecting the user-oriented design of the system. Science and technology make it possible for more users to enjoy a more comfortable driving experience. On the 8th Technology Festival held by the company, GWM announced that it would continue to expand the global research and development staff to 30,000 and the total investment in the next five years would reach CNY 100 billion.

292,0,"Vaccine pass already hurting business at struggling Hong Kong restaurants just hours after launch, industry representative says",1342 words,scmp.com,"The launch of the governmentâs vaccine pass scheme has proved to be yet another blow to Hong Kongâs already struggling restaurants, with one industry representative reporting an immediate drop in revenue and patrons being turned away for failing to comply with the new rules. Ray Chui Man-wai, chairman of Kam Kee Holdings, which operates 44 restaurants, said his groupâs business was already down by 40 per cent following the schemeâs introduction on Thursday morning, blaming the vaccine pass and a newly lowered cap on the number of diners per table for dampening peopleâs desire to eat out. ""There are quite a number of diners who still donât know how to use the vaccine pass. They think they only need to scan their âLeave Home Safeï¿½?app, but in fact they need to scan their vaccination record separately,ï¿½?he said. ""Our staff need to assist them one by one.ï¿½?Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge [https://www.scmp.com/knowledge], our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Under the scheme, people aged 12 and above must show proof of having received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine [https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/coronavirus-vaccine] to enter government venues and 23 other types of premises, including restaurants, shopping centres, wet markets and supermarkets. Residents must also register their visit on the governmentâs ""Leave Home Safeï¿½?risk-exposure app. Chui, who is also the chairman of the industry group Institute of Dining Art, said about 10 per cent of would-be diners on Thursday morning had been barred from entering restaurants as they had forgotten to upload their vaccination record to ""Leave Home Safeï¿½? ""Most of them were elderly people,ï¿½?he said. ""They had no idea that they needed to save their vaccination records in their app, and felt very frustrated.ï¿½?In Causeway Bay, restaurants, supermarkets and wet markets were unusually subdued on Thursday morning, with patrons few and far between. At Wealthy Garden, a Chinese restaurant in the area, only half the usual number of customers showed up for breakfast on Thursday morning, according to an employee who declined to be named. ""That means that we might lose 50 per cent of the revenue,ï¿½?she said, adding that the restaurant was popular with seniors, many of whom still had not been vaccinated ï¿½?though she noted the cold weather could have also played a part. Rather than the large, chatty groups commonly seen at dim sum brunches, the restaurantâs 20 or so customers were spread out in quiet ones and twos to comply with social-distancing rules. Many were still wearing protective gear, such as double masks and eye protection. The restaurant worker said she did not have any issues scanning the vaccination codes of the diners who did turn up. Among them was a 72-year-old surnamed Tsang, who said the vaccine pass was a necessary measure in the fight against Covid-19. ""Only when the pandemic has ended can we get back to a normal life,ï¿½?he said, adding that the new arrangement did not cause him any inconvenience. But not everyone was so sanguine about the new rules. Wang, an 82-year-old housewife, was frustrated after being denied entry to a supermarket on Thursday morning. ""I canât go anywhere without the vaccine pass now,ï¿½?she said. Though her son previously helped her install the ""Leave Home Safeï¿½?app, Wang was not aware it was now needed to get into supermarkets, and had left her phone at home. Wang said she had not yet been vaccinated, and was worried not only about catching the virus, but also being barred from the places where she shopped for food. ""I didnât have a clear answer from my doctor about whether I am fit for vaccination due to my chronic conditions,ï¿½?she said. Those with a valid medical excuse for not being jabbed are exempt from using the vaccine pass, but they must provide a doctorâs certificate. All venue employees must also be fully inoculated as part of the scheme, though they can also claim a medical exemption with a doctorâs certificate. Residents can either present their paper vaccine certificate or upload an electronic one to ""Leave Home Safeï¿½?or other government apps to create a QR code as proof of inoculation. ""Leave Home Safeï¿½?is required for entering restaurants anyway. Data stored by the app is encrypted and will automatically be erased after 31 days. Machines installed at restaurants to scan QR codes will notify staff with various sound alerts as to whether a patronâs inoculation or exemption record is valid. Exceptions to the scheme will include entering a venue to buy takeaway or retrieve belongings, getting tested or vaccinated, attending government, legal or medical appointments, or commuting home or to work. Certain premises, such as restaurants and clubhouses, will also require staff to actively check patronsï¿½?inoculation or exemption records, while customers must scan a QR code before entering. Venues such as malls, supermarkets, department stores and wet markets will only be subject to passive checks ï¿½?consisting of providing vaccination records when asked by law enforcement officers. However, a Cantonese restaurant with more than 60 years of business on Tuesday said it would close its doors for two weeks from Thursday, as it could not complete preparations for the vaccine pass on time. ""No vaccination, no business, no life,ï¿½?said Alan Yan Cheuk-lun, owner of Man Shing Restaurant in Tai Hang. Yan said he, his 64-year-old mother and his two brothers, who all operate the restaurant together, could not get vaccinated for medical reasons. ""It is time for us to take a rest and have our body checks,ï¿½?he said. A government spokesman said restaurant staff with a certified medical exemption should undergo Covid-19 testing every seven days, while those without one would need to get their shots to return to work. The cityâs shopping malls have been gearing up for the scheme by conducting drills, displaying notices at entrances and playing government promotional videos on their premises. Rail giant the MTR Corporation, which operates a number of shopping centres across the city, said it had adopted several measures to ensure the smooth implementation of the vaccine pass, including sending letters to tenants to remind them to abide by the schemeâs requirements. ""We shall implement the arrangements at MTR malls with our best endeavours including ï¿½?displaying clear and sufficient notices at the entrances/exits of the malls to allow the public to comply with the relevant laws and regulations, and showing the governmentâs promotional videos on the vaccine pass in our malls,ï¿½?it said. On Thursday, a photo being widely shared on social media showed a gigantic two-metre ""Leave Home Safeï¿½?QR code being displayed at the Maritime Square mall attached to the Tsing Yi MTR station.  Link Reit, Asiaâs largest real estate investment trust, which runs 75 malls in Hong Kong, said it had conducted five drills across its shopping centres in Wong Tai Sin, Sha Tin, Tin Shui Wai and Tung Chung since last Thursday for tenants to get familiarised with the rules. It added that it would deploy extra staff at high-traffic mall entrances on Thursday to assist visitors with scanning the ""Leave Home Safeï¿½?QR code. A spokeswoman for Sino Group said the company had posted signs at entrances and prominent locations, and that additional staff would be added to assist patrons at its malls."

In an open letter[https://neilyoungarchives.com/news/1/article?id=A-Message-To-Spotify] to his manager and record label telling them to have his catalogue taken down, the Heart of Gold singer writes: 'They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.' Young, 76, hit out at the streaming platform, which offers 72 albums of his work, for 'spreading fake information about vaccines.' But the singer sold 50 percent of his catalogue to U.K. investment fund Hipgnosis Songs last year, reportedly [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55557633]for $150 million, and it remains unclear whether the split ownership of Young's catalogue means he has the right to make this demand. MailOnline has contacted Hipgnosis Songs, Spotify, Joe Rogan and Neil Young for comment. In the now-deleted online letter, he specifically took aim at comedian and podcaster Rogan, who signed a $100 million deal with Spotify in May 2020, giving them exclusive rights to his show The Joe Rogan Experience. 'With an estimated 11 million listeners per episode, JRE [Joe Rogan Experience], which is hosted exclusively on Spotify, is the world's largest podcast and has tremendous influence,' he writes. 'Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform, though the company presently has no misinformation policy.' 'I want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform ï¿½?They can have Rogan or Young. Not both,' continued Young, who is married to Blade Runner actress Daryl Hannah, 61. 'I am doing this because Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines ï¿½?potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them. 'Please act on this immediately today and keep me informed of the time schedule,' he adds. The letter was addressed to Frank Gironda, Young's manager, and Warner Records, which releases his work through Reprise Records. Gironda confirmed the letter to the Daily Beast[https://www.thedailybeast.com/neil-young-demands-his-music-be-pulled-from-spotify-over-vaccine-misinformation-on-joe-rogan-podcast], adding: 'It's something that's really important to Neil. He's very upset ï¿½?we're trying to figure this out right now.' Young has been an advocate of the COVID-19 vaccines in the past, most recently when he cancelled his appearance at the Farm Aid concert in August 2021, citing that the event could be a super spreader for the Delta variant at the time. Young had previously removed most of his music from Spotify in 2015 over 'sound quality' issues, but he 'ultimately relented,' returning to Spotify in 2016, Rolling Stone[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/neil-young-demands-spotify-remove-music-vaccine-disinformation-1290020/] reported. Young is not the only artist to pull his music from Spotify. In 2015, Prince also removed his songs from the streaming service in order to negotiate the rights to his music. Prince's music returned to Spotify in 2017 nearly a year after his death in 2016. In 2014, Taylor Swift famously removed her music from Spotify, claiming the streaming service did not provide enough money for artists. The singer returned to the service in 2017 after her management agreed to distribute their Spotify revenue from her songs to their other artists. On social media, many were skeptical to believe Spotify would ever choose Young over Rogan. One Twitter user named Erica Arcangelo wrote: 'Young overestimates his popularity if he's going up against Rogan. I didn't know he was even still alive.' Another user with the handle name WillM said: 'Obviously theyâll choose Rogan, but Neil Young has a ton of great songs. One of the best guitar players of a generation.' Yet another user by the name Charly echoed these remarks, tweeting: 'Hate to break this to Neil but pretty sure they're going to keep the guy that is still producing new content weekly that draws in tens of millions of views an episode. Lol.' User One Random Person was a bit more critical, writing: 'Most popular podcast on the planet or a washed 76 year old musicianï¿½?tough call for Spotify.' Young's letter is not the first time Spotify has faced criticism for its partnership with Rogan. Young's demand comes just weeks after Spotify was lobbied in a letter by 270 'doctors' to adopt a misinformation policy after the comedian hosted the controversial Dr. Robert Malone. However, days after the letter emerged, it was revealed that not all the 270 were, in fact, doctors. The letter-signers were made up by engineers, podcasters and teachers, as well as a veterinarian, a dentist, a social worker and several psychologists. During a three-hour-and-six-minute interview on the now-viral episode #1,757 of The Joe Rogan Experience, Malone compared the U.S. to Nazi Germany and said today's society was suffering from a 'mass formation psychosis' over the use of vaccines. He also claimed to be part of the team that invented the mRNA technology used in the Covid-19 jab and said pharmaceutical companies administering vaccines - such as Pfizer and Moderna - have 'financial conflicts of interest.' Hundreds of medical professionals have fact-checked Malone and demanded accountability from Spotify. In an open letter, they said: 'With an estimated 11 million listeners per episode, JRE, which is hosted exclusively on Spotify, is the world's largest podcast and has tremendous influence. 'Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform, though the company presently has no misinformation policy.' The letter claims Rogan has a penchant for 'broadcasting misinformation, particularly regarding the COVID-19 pandemic' and that the episode with Malone promoted 'baseless conspiracy theories,' including 'an unfounded theory that societal leaders have 'hypnotized the public.' Read the full letter sent to Spotify - accusing Joe Rogan's episode with Dr Robert Malone of 'damaging public trust in scientific research' An Open Letter to Spotify: A call from the global scientific and medical communities to implement a misinformation policy: On Dec. 31, 2021, the Joe Rogan Experience (JRE), a Spotify-exclusive podcast, uploaded a highly controversial episode featuring guest Dr. Robert Malone (#1757). The episode has been criticized for promoting baseless conspiracy theories and the JRE has a concerning history of broadcasting misinformation, particularly regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. By allowing the propagation of false and societally harmful assertions, Spotify is enabling its hosted media to damage public trust in scientific research and sow doubt in the credibility of data-driven guidance offered by medical professionals. JRE #1757 is not the only transgression to occur on the Spotify platform, but a relevant example of the platformâs failure to mitigate the damage it is causing. We are a coalition of scientists, medical professionals, professors, and science communicators spanning a wide range of fields such as microbiology, immunology, epidemiology, and neuroscience and we are calling on Spotify to take action against the mass-misinformation events which continue to occur on its platform. With an estimated 11 million listeners per episode, JRE is the worldâs largest podcast and has tremendous influence. Though Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform, the company presently has no misinformation policy. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Joe Rogan has repeatedly spread misleading and false claims on his podcast, provoking distrust in science and medicine. He has discouraged vaccination in young people and children, incorrectly claimed that mRNA vaccines are âgene therapy,ï¿½?promoted off-label use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 (contrary to FDA warnings), and spread a number of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. In episode #1757, Rogan hosted Dr. Robert Malone, who was suspended from Twitter for spreading misinformation about COVID-19. Dr. Malone used the JRE platform to further promote numerous baseless claims, including several falsehoods about COVID-19 vaccines and an unfounded theory that societal leaders have âhypnotizedï¿½?the public. Many of these statements have already been discredited. Notably, Dr. Malone is one of two recent JRE guests who has compared pandemic policies to the Holocaust. These actions are not only objectionable and offensive, but also medically and culturally dangerous. The average age of JRE listeners is 24 years old and according to data from Washington State, unvaccinated 12-34 year olds are 12 times more likely to be hospitalized with COVID than those who are fully vaccinated. Dr. Maloneâs interview has reached many tens of millions of listeners vulnerable to predatory medical misinformation. Mass-misinformation events of this scale have extraordinarily dangerous ramifications. As scientists, we face backlash and resistance as the public grows to distrust our research and expertise. As educators and science communicators, we are tasked with repairing the publicâs damaged understanding of science and medicine. As physicians, we bear the arduous weight of a pandemic that has stretched our medical systems to their limits and only stands to be exacerbated by the anti-vaccination sentiment woven into this and other episodes of Roganâs podcast. This is not only a scientific or medical concern; it is a sociological issue of devastating proportions and Spotify is responsible for allowing this activity to thrive on its platform. We, the undersigned doctors, nurses, scientists, and educators thus call on Spotify to immediately establish a clear and public policy to moderate misinformation on its platform.

Analysts are worried that the continuing omicron outbreak will keep people at home, reducing demand for toll roads and public transport such as trams and trains, while clogged global supply chains[https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/pm-urges-action-on-freight-flights-to-ease-inflation-20220121-p59q9n] have raised the cost of obtaining materials for new transport and infrastructure projects and caused delays. The potential for higher interest rates is also a concern. JPMorgan analyst Anthony Longo said the transport and infrastructure sector had historically underperformed during periods of rising interest rates, particularly Transurban and Sydney Airport, which will be delisted from the Australian Securities Exchange this week if the NSW Supreme Court approves a $23.6 billion takeover.[https://www.afr.com/companies/infrastructure/creeping-inflation-fuels-spate-of-infrastructure-deals-20220204-p59ts2] Transurban's toll road concessions allow the company to increase tolls at the rate of inflation or higher, making it a popular investment. On the road again But when the Reserve Bank starts raising interest rates, analysts expect construction and general economic activity to slow, potentially crimping the number of trucks and cars that use Transurban's toll roads. Still, Mr Longo singled out Transurban as a ""core holding"" because of its long-term toll road concessions and its continued pursuit of new projects. It reports half-year results on February 17. The smaller toll road group, Atlas Arteria, which owns roads in France, Germany and the US and reports on February 24, is expected to perform well this year. Macquarie Research rates the company at ""outperform"", arguing that its key asset, the 2318-kilometre Autoroutes Paris-Rhin-Rhone (APRR) toll road in France, should benefit from any inflation in that country because it is allowed to raise toll fares by 70 per cent of the rate of European consumer price indices and can also ask for specific price increases to reflect tax increases or capital spending. The bank also forecast that traffic flows on the APRR this year would be stronger than in 2019, as tourist destinations such as ski fields reopen and some people continue to prefer to travel in their car rather than take a train or plane. The results of rail haulage group Aurizon will be closely examined on February 14 for insights into how coal exports are faring. ""Specific details such as the impact of any weather events on volumes will be noted, as will any comments relating to China's unofficial ban on Australian coal exports,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Owen Birrell, who has an ""underperform"" rating on the stock. Aurizon will also be quizzed on the progress of its controversial $2.35 billion acquisition[https://www.afr.com/companies/infrastructure/aurizon-shares-fall-to-earth-while-it-reassesses-its-coal-links-20211216-p59i7k] of freight rail group One Rail Australia. It wants to buy One Rail to diversify away from coal haulage and deepen its exposure to other commodities such as grain, copper and iron ore. But Merlon Capital Partners said in its December quarterly report that it had reduced its holdings in Aurizon on the back of ""a very disappointing expensive acquisition of a non-coal haulage business to increase the popularity of the group with other investors"". JPMorgan's Mr Longo said Aurizon was his least preferred stock because of its coal exposure. ""Ambition to diversify from âproblem' thermal coal via growing its bulk presence has been emphasised by Aurizon's management, with some inroads having been made in this regard,"" he said. ""However, we are concerned on the longer-term outlook and share price overhang thermal coal may present."""

At a virtual press conference, Farid said Maybankâs expertise in operating as a digital bank, in addition to its role as a traditional bank, demonstrated its strength in providing cutting-edge solutions for customers. âOver the last year, we have been able to design our own lifestyle applications, introduce digital financing solutions in Malaysia that cut across retail and non-retail segments for products such as mortgage, personal and small and medium enterprises financing.ï¿½?He said while Maybank would continue to develop digital products and services for customers, it would also use the capability to drive sustainable practices to support the community. Meanwhile, Maybank said a year on from the launch of its M25 Plan, the group was on track to meet the stated goals. The bank will continue to accelerate efforts to unlock greater value for all its stakeholders. âThis will be achieved by enhancing its digital capabilities, discovering more new value drivers for business growth as well as championing sustainable practices.ï¿½?Zamzamzairani said M25 was anchored by its mission of humanising financial services and would focus on three priorities, namely âPervasively Digitalï¿½? âNew Value Driversï¿½?and âSustainabilityï¿½? âIn the course of a year, these pillars have served its respective purpose and have tracked our planned milestones,ï¿½?he added.

66,0,"As offices reopen, some Torontonians who fled to the 'burbs are seeking second homes downtown",876 words,The Toronto Star,"But as some employers in the Toronto core are calling staff back to the office ï¿½?at least a couple of days a week ï¿½?some employees are regretting the big move away, several realtors told the Star, and are now trying to find a second place in the city. âTheyâre people who bought in Whitby ï¿½?they bought a house, but then they realize their job wants them to be in the office half the week,ï¿½?said Nasma Ali, a Toronto broker and founder of One Group, a real estate agency. She said sheâs been approached by single people who bought homes outside the Toronto core and are now looking for rentals downtown as theyâve been called back to work. âInstead of selling their house, theyâre thinking theyâre going to rent out their house, and rent downtown to be closer to the office,ï¿½?said Ali. âItâs not just the commute ï¿½?itâs also gas,ï¿½?she said, as gas prices have risen due to the invasion of Ukraine, leading to much more costly commutes. Mila Sheina, a Toronto realtor and broker at The Spring Team, says she has some clients who bought elsewhere and are looking for micro-condos to live in a few days a week while at the office. âTheyâre the size of an office pod, with a toilet. I actually have a guy who lives somewhere far away, who is looking to purchase a place downtown just so he can come there when heâs driving down to Toronto (to) work,ï¿½?said Sheina. Nicole Li, a Toronto realtor at HomeLife Landmark Realty, said although her clients arenât looking for a second place downtown, many who are under 35 and went to live with their parents during the pandemic are now looking to move back to the city as soon as possible. âEveryone just wants to move to downtown Toronto again, and thatâs why the prices have been going up,ï¿½?she said. In recent months, prices of Toronto condos have surged, increasing 16.4 per cent year over year in the fourth quarter of 2021 and reaching an average of $710,087, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board. At the same time, the price of a one-bedroom rental in Toronto has increased by 13.7 per cent to $2,099, according to TRREB. Saeid Hashemi, one of the volunteers at More Neighbours, an affordable housing advocacy group, said a solution is to ensure that multiple types of housing are available to increase supply, so there is less concern over a person buying multiple properties and taking up stock. âThe reason we have this, is a shortage generally,ï¿½?he said. âWeâre essentially playing musical chairs with our housing stock ... more for someone, means less for someone else,ï¿½?he said. If that supply was there, itâs not necessarily a bad thing to have people live closer to where their jobs are, as reducing commutes is better for the environment, he added. However, Mark Richardson, a volunteer technical lead with advocacy group HousingNowTO, said the number of people looking for a second, smaller unit in the core is likely not significant enough to cause any major disruptions. He said younger people are returning to the city in droves, particularly university and college students in the next few months, which will have a bigger impact on the rental market. âThere are only so many people who sold up and moved out of town, and there are only so many of those people who are being told they have to come back to the office, 220 days a year downtown,ï¿½?he said, as many companies are continuing with flexible work-from-home arrangements. And despite the conundrum these employees now find themselves in, those who were able to work from home and buy into the market outside the city are still the ones to have benefited from the housing market during the pandemic, said Nemoy Lewis, an assistant professor at the school of urban and regional planning at Ryerson University. âYou have a situation like this where you have folks that were able to work from home, able to keep their jobs, were able to afford homes in the suburbs and then rent units in the downtown core,ï¿½?he said. Interest rates in 2020 were at record lows, which benefitted upper and middle class people seeking to get into the market, said Lewis, while many lower income people lost their jobs or were evicted during the same time. âIt goes to show you the failures of the system itself and policies to adequately allocate housing in this city,ï¿½?he said.

282,1,Auto insurance brought in $1.3 billion more than they paid out in 2020: Superintendent report,866 words,Postmedia Breaking News,"NDP Energy Critic Kathleen Ganley said Friday that insurance companies are making hundreds of millions more off the back of Alberta drivers with the help of UCP policies. Premier Jason Kenney scrapped a rate increase cap on auto insurers in 2019 after it was imposed by the previous NDP government. ""They were able to do this because the UCP removed the cap we put in place to limit increases to premiums,"" said Ganley. ""That's $385 million more out of the pockets of Alberta drivers in a single year. No wonder the UCP tried to hide the report before we call them out on it. No wonder they tried to bury it ahead of a long weekend."" The NDP has accused the government of attempting to suppress the superintendent's report for 2020 and 2021, saying it has been produced for more than 100 years. Ganley said the increases came during a year when many people parked their cars due to the pandemic and hardly drove. Despite that, they still saw rate increases, she said. ""Alberta drivers when you look at your car insurance bill, remember that you are getting worked over by an extremely profitable corporation with the help of the UCP,"" said Ganley. Kassandra Kitz, press secretary to Finance Minister Travis Toews, said that since much of the information in the report is publicly available elsewhere, the office of the superintendent had paused the release of the annual document while assessing if the report was still necessary. ""They have since taken action to continue the annual report publication,"" said Kitz in an email. Kitz said Albertans deserve an automobile insurance system that is fair, accessible and affordable and that is why the government is committed to examining ways to improve that system. She noted the government introduced Bill 41: the Insurance Amendment Act that changed regulations around how premiums are calculated. ""We introduced Bill 41 last session that made legislative and regulatory changes to stabilize auto insurance rates, enhance medical care benefits, and ensure more options and flexibility for drivers,"" said Kitz. She said seven insurers have filed for rate reductions in 2021 and that across the board, premium rates for private vehicles is down by just under one per cent over the past 12 months. An analysis using industry and regulator data before the report was released Thursday suggested insurance companies had raked in nearly $2.1-billion in profits during the COVID-19 pandemic. An analysis done by actuary Craig Allen that he says is based on figures provided by the Alberta Automobile Insurance Rate Board (AAIRB) shows auto insurers in 2020 pocketed $928 million in pre-tax profits and another $1.153 billion the following year. The 2021 figure, said Allen, is based on available numbers for the first half of that year and projections for the remainder. ""My estimate of what the profit's going to be is fairly conservative, cautious,"" he said. ""The COVID-19 pandemic and reduction in traffic certainly through the first half of 2021 that reduced the volume of accidents and claims is the real main driver."" The analysis was conducted for the group Fair Alberta which includes lawyers, medical professionals and injured Albertans. An insurance industry spokesman echoed the nearly 1 per cent rate decrease cited by Kitz, adding Allen's numbers are incomplete and skewed. He said it doesn't include more than $100 million in vehicle damage claims from the June 2020 hail storm that ravaged northeast Calgary and more vehicular traffic and probably more eventual payouts in the second half of last year. ""It's inappropriate to take a point in time and extrapolate it for an entire year...it's not necessarily accurate,"" said Aaron Sutherland, vice-president of the Insurance Bureau of Canada. He said it's illegal for insurance company profits to exceed 7 per cent so ""the notion we're making any kind of windfall is fanciful."" With inflation running at nearly 6 per cent and price increases of car parts and used vehicles far exceeding that, ""we're seeing a lot of pressure on pocketbooks but auto insurance isn't one of them."" He agreed many insurers' financial picture has improved recently but that some companies are doing considerably better than others. dshort@postmedia.com( mailto:dshort@postmedia.com ) BKaufmann@postmedia.com( mailto:BKaufmann@postmedia.com )"

Global supply also was beginning to improve into fiscal 2023, Boss said, with management seeing the right assortment in place for fall 2022. North American revenue may be down year over year due to supply constraints, while Europe could be underappreciated, with Boss modeling 10.5% year-over-year growth in the segment for the fourth quarter.  Nike could also continue to expand gross margin as higher demand and lower supply has given the brand better pricing power, he added.

In a blog post on Monday, Meta attributed the hacking efforts to a group known as Ghostwriter, which it said successfully gained access to the targetsï¿½?social media accounts. Meta said the hackers attempted to post YouTube videos from the accounts portraying Ukrainian troops as weakened, including one video which claimed to show Ukrainian soldiers coming out of a forest and flying a white flag of surrender.

922,1,Worldwide Advanced Drill Data Management Solutions Industry to 2027 - Conventional Segment to Dominate the Market - ResearchAndMarkets.com,840 words,Business Wire,"The advanced drill data management solutions market is expected to rise at a CAGR of more than 3% during the forecast period of 2020-2025. Key Market Trends Conventional Segment to Dominate the Market -- In advanced drill data management, the data is administered with a single set of tools for importing, exporting, viewing, editing, and performing database administration. By centralizing all data available for an exploration & production asset in a single integrated data store, project data-management systems significantly reduces the amount of time spent moving data between applications. -- Data-management systems serve as readily accessible repositories for the knowledge about an asset. This knowledge comes from a variety of studies and continues to grow over the life of the asset. Data from the wells nearby can also help in determining the production rate of the wells that are being drilled, which may help in the increase in profits for the company using the system. -- Although conventional resources are considered easier to recover from the reservoirs, the fields have matured around the globe. Also, companies have to drill further to find viable oil and gas sources, which has led to an increase in the requirement for the drilling data management systems. -- According to BP Statistical Review, the production of gas has increased in the world by 3.4%, to 385.98 Billion cubic feet per day, in 2019 from 373.22 Billion cubic feet per day in 2018. Natural Gas has been replacing coal in the power industry and is expected to increase in production further in the forecast period, which may aid the growth of the advanced drill data management market. -- Hence, conventional resources are expected to dominate the market for advanced drilling data management solutions in the forecast period due to a large share of oil and gas production and increasing complexity in the recovery. North America to Dominate the Market -- North America increased its production of crude oil significantly by 7.1%, to 1116.5 million tonnes of oil, in 2019 from 1042.2 million tonnes of oil in 2018. Crude oil production is expected to increase further in the forecast period due to increasing investments in the increase of the wells. Growing numbers of wells are expected to aid the growth of advanced drill data management solutions. -- Unconventional resources have created a new paradigm in the industry that require a lot of multilateral and horizontal wells to be drilled, that require a lot of data handling. drilling data management market is expected to gain a lot from the increase in shale oil and gas production increase. -- Shale oil and gas wells have a characteristic of depleting much faster than a conventional well.

69,0,Shanghai Disney Resort to Close Monday Amid Covid-19 Surge in China -- WSJ,515 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"The resort said it would consult local authorities and notify guests as soon as it had a confirmed date to resume operations. China reported 1,656 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases on Saturday, health authorities said, compared with about 70 cases at the beginning of the month. Meanwhile, mainland China reported its first deaths from Covid-19 in more than a year on Saturday as the country battles a surge of Omicron infections. Two patients died of Covid-19 in the northeastern province of Jilin, which has been hard hit by the Omicron wave, China's National Health Commission said. The deaths, both of which occurred March 18, are the nation's first recorded fatalities since Jan. 26, 2021. Earlier in the week, Chinese health authorities barred Jilin's 24 million residents from leaving the province, the first time such restrictions have been imposed on an entire province since Hubei province, home to the city of Wuhan, was locked down at the start of the pandemic. China -- the world's most populous country -- has reported fewer than 5,000 deaths from the coronavirus since the pandemic began in 2020. It has kept infections and death counts low through costly and laborious measures including tight border controls, targeted lockdowns, mass testing and digital surveillance.  Walt Disney Co., which is a minority owner in the Chinese resort, said that its theme parks and resorts generated record income in its fiscal first quarter, signaling that the worst of the damage the company suffered from the coronavirus pandemic may be behind it. Shanghai Disneyland, which first opened in 2016, was the first Disney park to close as the coronavirus pandemic spread throughout China in early 2020. Disney later closed all of its parks, costing the company billions of dollars in revenue. Shanghai Disneyland reopened in May 2020. In late October, Shanghai Disneyland locked more than 30,000 visitors inside its theme park and forced them to take Covid-19 tests after one customer came back positive for the virus -- an example of the zero tolerance policy imposed by the Chinese government. China is attempting to move on from its so-called Covid-Zero lockdown measures in favor of a more precise approach to containing the virus that is less damaging to its economy. The updated measures, which include more efficient testing and shorter and more targeted quarantines, are being put to the test by the latest Omicron wave. -- Elaine Yu, Natasha Khan, Erich Schwartzel and Sha Hua contributed to this article.

850,1,Banking & Finance: HSBC Goes on Hiring Spree in Asia,730 words,The Wall Street Journal,"""Asia is where we are doubling down our efforts, not only because Asia wealth is growing twice as fast as the rest of the world, but also because we are 'the bank of Asia,'"" said Nuno Matos, chief executive of HSBC's wealth and personal banking division. The unit caters to some 38 million customers world-wide, from holders of regular checking accounts to ultrarich clients with more than $30 million to invest. It spans areas such as insurance, wealth management and private banking, plus retail-banking businesses like mortgages and credit cards. About one-third of customers are in Asia, Mr. Matos said. Mr. Matos said the bank hired about 1,200 people in its Asia wealth business last year and was likely to add more or less as many this year. That includes lifting the number of wealth planners at Pinnacle, its branchless onshore wealth business in China, he said, to 1,000 or more from about 700. The expansion shows HSBC is pushing ahead with its plan, detailed last year, to hire more than 5,000 people, including some 3,000 at Pinnacle, to work with rich clients in the region. More broadly, HSBC said last year it would invest more than $3.5 billion over five years to expand its Asian wealth business, as part of a $6 billion plan to sharpen its focus on the region. Mr. Matos said the onshore venture now has some 200,000 registered users of its app, River, which offers market analysis as well as tools such as a family expenses tracker and a retirement calculator. HSBC hopes to convert app users into bank clients by referring them to Pinnacle wealth planners.  HSBC is placing long-term bets on China and Asia against a challenging backdrop. Global markets have been rattled by the war in Ukraine, rapid inflation and a shift toward tighter U.S. monetary policy. Meanwhile, Covid-19 lockdowns in China are weighing on an economy that weathered a series of corporate crackdowns. The World Bank recently cut its forecast for growth in China's gross domestic product this year to 5%, from 5.4% six months ago, and warned that a tougher scenario could cut that to 4%. Stock markets in mainland China and Hong Kong pulled back this year, after declines in 2021. The ranks of Asia's wealthy are growing rapidly -- for example, last year Credit Suisse estimated that by 2025 China would be home to 10.2 million millionaires, 93% more than in 2020. But while HSBC has deep roots in the region, it is far from alone in chasing this growing market.  Citigroup Inc. is also hiring thousands of staff, and targeting a big increase in the assets it manages for clients in Asia, while paring back its consumer-banking operations UBS Group AG is also intent on capturing growth in Asian wealth, as well as in the U.S. Wealth clients in China have increasingly complex demands, said Mr. Matos. ""We are seeing a shift every year, where customers are now being much more conscious of the need to invest in more-sophisticated products. That could be equity, mutual funds, fixed income,"" or even alternative assets for high-net-worth clients, he said. And Asian clients are diversifying globally, rather than investing solely in the region, he said.  HSBC has struck a series of deals recently to bolster its offerings in Asia. These include acquiring AXA SA's Singapore operations for about $529 million and securing approval to take full control of an onshore Chinese life-insurance business. In India, it agreed to buy L&T Investment Management Ltd. for $425 million. ""We will always be looking for bolt-on acquisitions, bespoke acquisitions, provided that they deliver value for shareholders, they acquire scale, they acquire capabilities,"" Mr. Matos said.

395,0,"Schools will only close again as a last resort, says Ardern",745 words,The New Zealand Herald,"Ardern yesterday set out her agenda for the year on the first day of Parliament under red light restrictions ï¿½?meaning masks around Parliament and only half the full contingent of MPs in the debating chamber at any time. Freedom Convoy demonstrators gathered outside, protesting against restrictions of the Covid-19 response. Ardern focused mainly on the Covid-19 response as the Government negotiated the Omicron outbreak and prepared for future variants. She said the Government was committed to keeping schools open after a disrupted two years for students and teachers during lockdowns. âThe latest evidence shows that school closures are finely balanced. They can cause significant indirect harm to children, including widening educational inequities, poorer mental health, behavioural difficulties, social isolation, family stress, family violence and food insecurity.ï¿½?She said they also had a disproportionate impact on MÄori and Pasifika children, as well as those from poorer households. âWe are committed to keeping schools and early learning services open, with closures only as a last resort due to a significant outbreak in a school or service, staff absences that make it unsafe to operate, or a local lockdown.ï¿½?Ardern said the focus for the Government was on improving the health system to deal with the upcoming winter, and the influenza vaccination rollout would be critical to help reduce the risk of âunnecessary pressuresï¿½?on the health system: a double-header flu and Covid outbreak. Speaking to the media afterwards, Ardern said that although flu rates had been low since the borders closed, the RSV scare last year showed how much pressure outbreaks could put on the health system. The Government was expanding the eligibility for free flu jabs, and would run a vaccination campaign and use the Covid-19 infrastructure to roll it out. Soon after her speech, Health Minister Andrew Little announced the eligibility would widen to cover about 250,000 more people, meaning around two million would qualify for it. Ardern also said New Zealand was in a better position now than most other countries it compared itself to and credited the Governmentâs Covid-19 response with protecting New Zealanders from the âDelta destructionï¿½?other countries had faced. However, National Party leader Christopher Luxon took aim at that Covid-19 management, saying although 2020 had been strong, 2021 had been a âshamblesï¿½? He dedicated most of his speech to the economy and cost of living, pointed to the rising cost of petrol and groceries, the wage gap between New Zealand and Australia, and the steep increase in house prices. âYou get a Prime Minister who promised to make housing more affordable but instead sheâs delivered the largest, fastest increase in house prices in our nationâs history. The average house price is now over $1 million, and in just four years of Labour mismanagement weâve seen house prices rise by a staggering $380,000. Itâs a truly shocking result of Government incompetence.ï¿½?He also predicted that Labour would end up backing down on its Three Waters reforms, saying Finance Minister Grant Robertson would decide it was too unpopular to go ahead with. Ardern had confirmed in her opening statement that the Government would forge ahead with Three Waters this year, after it was delayed last year for more consultation because of opposition from councils. âIt is clear that without our plan to establish four publicly owned water service entities we will continue to see a frail network and contaminated water in many communities. To delay will only push the problem on, and increase future household costs.ï¿½?Ardernâs speech also looked at other priorities for the Government, including health reforms. The measures will abolish district health boards and set up a Health NZ agency and MÄori Health Authority alongside it. She said the pandemic showed the weaknesses of the current system. Other areas of focus included climate change and environmental measures, child poverty, housing supply and the infrastructure projects the Government has announced, including in transport and schools."

840,0,Will Neil Young influence others to demand accountability?,716 words,Winnipeg Free Press,"Some examples: Rogan was an early champion of ivermectin, a.k.a. the horse dewormer, which he then claimed he was taking after he contracted COVID-19 in the summer. He's also claimed that young healthy people do not need to be vaccinated, and claimed that mRNA vaccines are âgene therapy."" The JRE was the most-popular podcast on Spotify last year, with millions of listeners per episode. That's a lot of people who are not only hearing disinformation, but then likely spreading it themselves among their Facebook friends. All of this raises a question: whose responsibility is disinformation, anyway? This is not an issue exclusive to Spotify. Social media has made everyone a publisher and content creator. Instagram influencers ï¿½?who now make up a billion-dollar industry ï¿½?casually spread both disinformation (deliberate) and misinformation (not deliberate) all the time, particularly in wellness spaces and, troublingly, in maternal wellness spaces. But they all use variations of the same qualifier to let themselves (and the platform) off the hook: âI'm not a medical doctor, but this is what works for me. I'm just telling you what works for me."" OK, sure ï¿½?but the problem is baked right into the name of your profession: influencer. Which means that people are, for better or worse, influenced by you. They respect your opinion, or at least your taste in products. People tend to trust their peers; spend enough time with influencers or podcasters, via their Instagram Stories or having their chatter constantly accompanying you while you're out for a walk or while you're stirring sauce on the stove, well, they start to feel like people you know. People you can trust. So, it's not hard to draw a line from a dangerous idea someone spouted on a podcast to the identical one being parroted at a dinner with friends. Repeat ad infinitum. Young isn't the only one who has demanded accountability from Spotify regarding the content of The Joe Rogan Experience. In December, a group of American scientists, medical professionals, professors, and science communicators wrote an open letter to the streaming service, underlining their concerns about Rogan's podcast. âThough Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform, the company presently has no misinformation policy,"" the letter reads. They are absolutely correct. The platforms that host people ï¿½?Instagram, Spotify, TikTok, whomever ï¿½?should ultimately be responsible for the content they produce. And that doesn't need to look like blanket censorship; as Jill Filipovic writes in a CNN column, ï¿½?Rogan) should be given room to discuss what he wants, even if that offends people who disagree with him politically. But the company should draw the line at dangerous life-threatening conspiracy theories and the kind of misinformation that could result in unnecessary illness and death."" She notes, too, that there is precedent for the removal of certain episodes of Rogan's podcast. Rogan's fans skew young. I don't think that the Venn diagram between Neil Young's audience and Joe Rogan's is exactly an overlapping circle. But if Young's position could inspire other big-name artists and content creators to demand accountability and action from the platforms that host them ï¿½?and that there will be expensive consequences for people who deliberately deceive the public ï¿½?perhaps we could begin to tame the hydra that is disinformation. Meanwhile, multiple media outlets reported Wednesday that Spotify has stripped Young's music from the platform. âWe regret Neil's decision to remove his music from Spotify, but hope to welcome him back soon,"" a Spotify spokesman told the Wall Street Journal, which also reported Rogan's deal with the platform, signed in 2020, to be worth $100 million. jen.zoratti@freepress.mb.ca Twitter: @Jen Zoratti"

666,0,Hacking collective Anonymous declares 'cyber war' against Vladimir Putin's government before announcing they have 'taken down' website of Kremlin-backed TV channel RT,529 words,Mail Online,"* Shortly afterwards they revealed they had targeted Kremlin-backed RT Hacking group Anonymous has declared 'cyber war' against Vladimir Putin's government after he mounted a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The elusive computer experts issued the stark announcement on their Twitter account on Thursday evening. They said shortly before 10pm: 'The Anonymous collective is officially in cyber war against the Russian government.' Around 30 minutes later, they announced that they had taken down the website of the Kremlin-backed TV channel RT, which broadcasts in Britain and has been heavily criticised for its coverage. When MailOnline attempted to access the site this morning, it was still inaccessible and only displayed an error message that said 'this site can't be reached'. The cyber war declaration raises the prospect that Russia could be subjected to systematic hacking attempts in the coming days. Prior to the invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, the country's government and banks were targeted by a massive cyber attack that was believed to have been carried out by Russia. People on social media responded positively to Anonymous's cyber war declaration against Putin. One person wrote: 'THANK YOU! Now, work on draining their finances.' Another said: 'You are awesome, thanks.' A third wrote: 'THANK YOU! I love you! The most beautiful thing EVER...' Anonymous said in their tweet about RT: 'The #Anonymous collective has taken down the website of the #Russian propaganda station RT News.' Anonymous have previously targeted groups including the Ku Klux Klan and Islamic extremists. Members are known as 'Anons' and are distinguished by their Guy Fawkes masks. In July last year, the collective warned Tesla founder Elon Musk that they planned to target him after saying he wields too much power over the cryptocurrency markets. THE ELUSIVE HACKING GROUP ANONYMOUS  Hacker group Anonymous has been linked to online attacks around the world aimed at punishing governments for policies of which the hackers disapprove. Members are known as 'Anons' and are distinguished by their Guy Fawkes masks. The group are seen as anything from digital Robin Hoods to cyber terrorists for their hacking campaigns against government agencies, child pornography sites and the Klu Klux Klan. In 2008 the online community staged a series of protests, pranks, and hacks Church of Scientology as part if its 'Project Chanology.' Later targets of Anonymous 'hacktivism' included government agencies of the US, Israel, Tunisia, Uganda, and others, copyright protection agencies; the Westboro Baptist Church; and corporations such as PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, and Sony. In 2013 they declared war on secretive 'chat sites' used by paedophiles to trade images. Last November they hacked into the Twitter account of the Ku Klux Klan after the white supremacist group distributed flyers threatening 'lethal force' protesters in Ferguson. Dozens of people have been arrested for involvement in Anonymous cyberattacks, in countries including the US, UK, Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, and Turkey."
206,0,"Restaurants hit by slowdown, temporary closures as Omicron bites",838 words,Business Times Singapore,"At the Les Amis group, there's been ""a general slowdown across the board, with business affected around 10 to 20 per cent, mainly in the mid-market segment"", said a spokesman, adding that when restaurants are operating at close to breakeven point, such a drop can adversely affect the bottom line. The group operates a wide spectrum of high-end to mid and casual restaurants, including the 3-star Les Amis, La Taperia, Peperoni and Nam Nam. ""Jan and Feb are usually quiet for us, but it has already stretched to early Mar,"" said the spokesman. ""People are more cautious about dining out."" Since Chinese New Year, cancellations and no-shows have become the norm as diners test positive for Covid on their reservation dates or have dining companions who became ill. Most of the time, restaurants which require a deposit for bookings waived them during this period. However, it has also given rise to opportunists, with one restaurant reporting that a customer submitted an outdated positive ART result to cancel a booking for 5 people, only to show up the next day on another friend's reservation. Another restaurant operator, whose outlets include a Michelin-starred restaurant as well as a cocktail bar, noted that the latter had been badly affected, likely due to its counter setting where guests are seated in close proximity. A spokesman said: ""Business for the bar has dropped at least 30 per cent, also because people take bars less seriously than a restaurant so we have a lot of no-shows."" For the Michelin-starred eatery, cancellations and no-shows account for about 15 to 20 per cent of business. Other Michelin eateries have also been affected, including the one-starred Nouri, whose chef-owner Ivan Brehm said business for Nouri and his bar concept Appetite has dropped 30 per cent on average. This, combined with the current 5-person dining limit and 10.30 pm alcohol curfew, continues to hamper the restaurant industry's recovery, he added. ""People aren't going out in droves, lunch business is down to all-time lows and business-related dining is also down."" For one-starred Labyrinth, bookings have remained stable, partly because chef-owner Han Li Guang said he is seeing more tourists in his restaurant now. ""Labyrinth has always been tourist-oriented, so we're seeing more overseas guests from the US, Australia and Hong Kong, which is making up for the drop in local diners."" Han added that last-minute cancellations also affected his bottom line as he had waived deposits of diners who could prove that they were Covid-positive. Restaurants were also hit by loss of revenue when they voluntarily closed after their staff were infected. Most close for 1 or 2 days for disinfection, but others such as Saint Pierre, Zen and Ruth's Chris Steak House closed for 4 to 8 days. Saint Pierre was among the first to announce that it closed from Feb 24 for 8 days after two of its kitchen staff contracted Omicron. It was the first time that any of its staff had been infected, according to Edina Hong, co-owner of the Saint Pierre group of restaurants. ""When the first of our staff tested positive, we immediately decided to close for 8 days to break any chain of transmission and as a precautionary measure for the safety of our guests,"" she said. There were no other cases beyond the initial 2, and the restaurant reopened on Mar 4. While glad that the infection did not spread, ""what's painful is the loss of revenue coupled with the fact that our fixed overheads still exist"", said Hong. ""Another aspect is the loss of momentum. Every time we close, we would need to retrain the staff to prevent their skills from getting rusty."" Tristin Farmer of the 3-Michelin-starred Zen also opted for the ""better to be safe than sorry"" approach when he decided to close the restaurant last week after several team members tested positive. The restaurant is expected to reopen today. ""We made the tough call to close, to keep our team and guests safe and respect the regulations that have been put in place,"" he said. Things may start picking up in April if the Omicron outbreak peaks as expected and cases start to come down, said the Les Amis spokesman. ""This would allow the government to further relax dining restrictions to 8 persons, sending a signal that the worst is over."""
661,0,Russian State Media Bolster Putin's Narrative for Ukraine Invasion -- WSJ,3004 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"State broadcasters, lawmakers and pro-Kremlin pundits have sought to advance Mr. Putin's narrative that Ukraine is an aggressor that threatens Russia and the Russian-controlled territories in the Donbas, in eastern Ukraine. ""The Armed Forces of Ukraine don't stop shooting at settlements of Donbas,"" Russia's Channel One reported Friday. Earlier this week, Mr. Putin ordered an invasion of its smaller neighbor and, on Friday, Russian forces had entered Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, with fierce fighting threatening the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. State media has cited Ukrainian media saying residents of various cities, including the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, had heard several explosions and the sound of shelling. But Russian state news reports adhere closely to the Kremlin's narrative, repeated in statements by Russia's Defense Ministry, that their armed forces ""do not strike cities and towns [and] they take measures to save the lives of civilians."" On Saturday, Russia's communications regulator ordered the removal of reports from media that describe Moscow's attack on Ukraine as an ""assault, invasion or declaration of war,"" or face being fined or blocked. It accused several independent news organizations of publishing ""false information...under the guise of reliable messaging."" ""We emphasize that it is Russian official information sources that have reliable and up-to-date information,"" the agency said in a statement. On Friday, Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook said it would block Russian state media from running ads or making money from ads shown on its platform, after Moscow said that it was restricting access to Facebook in the country. The most prominent argument being promoted by pro-government figures and media to justify the invasion is that Ukraine has the potential to revive its nuclear arsenal and intends to do so with the purpose of targeting Russia. On Friday, one morning broadcast in Russia presented charts showing what it said was Ukraine's nuclear potential, including its ability to create what the presenter said was ""the most primitive, but no less dangerous"" so-called dirty bomb, or a conventional bomb that combines radioactive material. In 1994, three years after the demise of the Soviet Union, newly independent Ukraine agreed to give up its roughly 1,800 nuclear weapons, including short-range tactical weapons and air-launched cruise missiles, in exchange for security assurances from the U.S., the U.K. and Russia. This week, Moscow seized on recent comments by Mr. Zelensky regarding Ukraine's decision to cede the nuclear weapons as evidence of the threat Kyiv poses to Russia. Addressing the Munich Security Conference last weekend, Mr. Zelensky said today his country has neither those weapons, nor security for his country. But he added, ""We have something -- the right to demand a shift from a policy of appeasement to ensuring security and peace guarantees."" Moscow charges that Ukraine wants nuclear weapons with the intention of attacking Russia. Mr. Putin has often said that Kyiv ""has nuclear technologies created back in the Soviet times,"" specifying that some such weapons, including tactical missiles, have a range of over 100 kilometers, which is roughly 62 miles. And ""they can do more,"" the Russian president said in a televised address earlier this week. ""It's only a matter of time."" ""Ukraine intends to create its own nuclear weapons,"" he said, ""and this isn't just bragging."" If Kyiv is allowed to acquire ""weapons of mass destruction, the situation in the world and in Europe will drastically change, especially for us, for Russia. We cannot but react to this real danger."" The Russian leader has also reminded Russians that their country is one of the most powerful nuclear nations in the world, warning that an attack on Russia would lead to defeat of any potential aggressor. On Friday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian responded, telling French radio that Mr. Putin ""knows very well that NATO is also a nuclear alliance."" Nikolai Sokov, a senior fellow at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, worked for Russia's Foreign Ministry between 1987 and 1992 and handled the portfolio of nuclear weapons that remained out of Russia following the demise of the Soviet Union. While Ukraine inherited a significant share of the USSR's nuclear arsenal, it didn't have launch control, Mr. Sokov said in an email. That was entrusted to Russia under two agreements brokered in 1991. The last weapons that Kyiv inherited from the defunct Soviet state were withdrawn from Russia in 1996, and while Ukraine has a rich history of nuclear research and has deposits of uranium, ""it has never had key elements of nuclear industrial infrastructure critical for building nuclear weapons,"" Mr. Sokov said. Further, even keeping Soviet nuclear weapons ""was de facto impossible,"" because they need regular maintenance, refurbishing and the replacement of components, Mr. Sokov said. Ukraine didn't have the capacity to dismantle nuclear weapons and didn't produce many of the essential components for replacement, he said.

Write to Ann M. Simmons at ann.simmons@wsj.com 26 Feb 2022 11:53 ET Russian State Media Bolster Putin's Narrative for Ukraine Invasion -- Update By Ann M. Simmons MOSCOW -- Russian authorities and state-controlled media outlets have issued disinformation that seeks to support President Vladimir Putin's claims that Moscow was compelled to invade Ukraine to protect Russia's own security. State broadcasters, lawmakers and pro-Kremlin pundits have sought to advance Mr. Putin's narrative that Ukraine is an aggressor that threatens Russia and the Russian-controlled territories in the Donbas, in eastern Ukraine. ""The Armed Forces of Ukraine don't stop shooting at settlements of Donbas,"" Russia's Channel One reported Friday. Earlier this week, Mr. Putin ordered an invasion of its smaller neighbor and, on Friday, Russian forces had entered Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, with fierce fighting that is threatening the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. State media has cited Ukrainian media saying residents of various cities, including the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, had heard several explosions and the sound of shelling. But Russian state news reports adhere closely to the Kremlin's narrative, repeated in statements by Russia's Defense Ministry, that their armed forces ""do not strike cities and towns [and] they take measures to save the lives of civilians."" On Saturday, a special edition of the political talk show ""60 Minutes"" aired on Russia's Channel One, showing residential buildings with shattered windows, blown-out walls and rivers of rubble on streets in the Russian-led Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, as a result of what was described as assaults by Ukrainian forces. Residents were shown picking through debris in their homes. Also on Saturday, Russia's communications regulator ordered the removal of reports from media that describe Moscow's attack on Ukraine as an ""assault, invasion or declaration of war,"" or face being fined or blocked. It accused several independent news organizations of publishing ""false information...under the guise of reliable messaging."" ""We emphasize that it is Russian official information sources that have reliable and up-to-date information,"" the agency said in a statement. On Friday, Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook said it would block Russian state media from running ads or making money from ads shown on its platform, after Moscow said that it was restricting access to Facebook in the country. The most prominent argument being promoted by pro-government figures and media to justify the invasion is that Ukraine has the potential to revive its nuclear arsenal and intends to do so with the purpose of targeting Russia. On Friday, one morning broadcast in Russia presented charts showing what it said was Ukraine's nuclear potential, including its ability to create what the presenter said was ""the most primitive, but no less dangerous"" so-called dirty bomb, or a conventional bomb that combines radioactive material. In 1994, three years after the demise of the Soviet Union, newly independent Ukraine agreed to give up its roughly 1,800 nuclear weapons, including short-range tactical weapons and air-launched cruise missiles, in exchange for security assurances from the U.S., the U.K. and Russia. This week, Moscow seized on recent comments by Mr. Zelensky regarding Ukraine's decision to cede the nuclear weapons as evidence of the threat Kyiv poses to Russia. Addressing the Munich Security Conference last weekend, Mr. Zelensky said today his country has neither those weapons, nor security for his country. But he added, ""We have something -- the right to demand a shift from a policy of appeasement to ensuring security and peace guarantees."" Moscow charges that Ukraine wants nuclear weapons with the intention of attacking Russia. Mr. Putin has often said that Kyiv ""has nuclear technologies created back in the Soviet times,"" specifying that some such weapons, including tactical missiles, have a range of over 100 kilometers, which is roughly 62 miles. And ""they can do more,"" the Russian president said in a televised address earlier this week. ""It's only a matter of time."" ""Ukraine intends to create its own nuclear weapons,"" he said, ""and this isn't just bragging."" If Kyiv is allowed to acquire ""weapons of mass destruction, the situation in the world and in Europe will drastically change, especially for us, for Russia. We cannot but react to this real danger."" The Russian leader has also reminded Russians that their country is one of the most powerful nuclear nations in the world, warning that an attack on Russia would lead to defeat of any potential aggressor. On Friday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian responded, telling French radio that Mr. Putin ""knows very well that NATO is also a nuclear alliance."" Nikolai Sokov, a senior fellow at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, worked for Russia's Foreign Ministry between 1987 and 1992 and handled the portfolio of nuclear weapons that remained out of Russia following the demise of the Soviet Union. While Ukraine inherited a significant share of the USSR's nuclear arsenal, it didn't have launch control, Mr. Sokov said in an email. That was entrusted to Russia under two agreements brokered in 1991. The last weapons that Kyiv inherited from the defunct Soviet state were withdrawn from Russia in 1996, and while Ukraine has a rich history of nuclear research and has deposits of uranium, ""it has never had key elements of nuclear industrial infrastructure critical for building nuclear weapons,"" Mr. Sokov said. Further, even keeping Soviet nuclear weapons ""was de facto impossible,"" because they need regular maintenance, refurbishing and the replacement of components, Mr. Sokov said. Ukraine didn't have the capacity to dismantle nuclear weapons and didn't produce many of the essential components for replacement, he said. Today, building the necessary industrial infrastructure would take years and massive spending, and would encounter major opposition from the West, the analyst added. Rafael Loss, coordinator for pan-European data projects of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank, said the transfer of nuclear material was completed in 2001 and since then Ukraine has been fulfilling all of its obligations as a nonnuclear weapon state under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

But some Russians are repudiating the state's narrative defending Mr. Putin's decision to invade Ukraine. On Thursday, at least 170 Russian scientists and journalists signed an open letter, protesting the military offensive. ""This fatal step leads to huge human losses and undermines the foundations of the established system of international security,"" the letter says. ""The responsibility for unleashing a new war in Europe lies entirely with Russia. There is no rational justification for this war."" Another antiwar petition, published on the Telegram messenger channel of Elena Chernenko, a journalist with the Kommersant daily business newspaper, had garnered almost 300 signatures by Saturday evening. The petition led to Ms. Chernenko being expelled from the Russian Foreign Ministry journalists' pool, she wrote on Telegram on Friday. Also on Thursday, crowds of Russians took to the streets across the country to denounce the move, defying a continuing crackdown on political opposition that has markedly raised the risks of dissent and seen almost all prominent activists jailed or driven into exile. OVD-Info, a group that monitors police detentions, said more than 2,440 people were detained across at least 58 cities for participating in what the authorities deemed as unauthorized gatherings on Thursday and Friday.

533,0,A Canadian restaurant was closed after it accepted dog photos instead of vaccination proof,826 words,Washington Post.com,"The restaurant reopened on Monday, after the owner met with health officials and showed he had complied with the order by submitting a written plan to enforce the rules and training staff on them, health officials told The Washington Post. The Granary Kitchen's Facebook page explained the closure, calling it ""an unfortunate circumstance"" involving an ""underage hostess"" and said it would reopen after retraining staff. ""We would like to remind everyone of the tremendous pressure being placed on front staff, and please remember to be kind,"" the post read. An email to the owner of the restaurant requesting comment was not immediately returned. Alberta requires indoor diners to show proof of vaccination, a negative test within the last 72 hours, or a letter of medical exemption. Cities across the United States, too, are instituting new restrictions on indoor dining as the spread of the highly transmissible omicron variant has caused covid cases to surge. Starting this week, customers 12 and older must have gotten at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine to dine inside a restaurant in Washington, D.C., and beginning Feb. 15, indoor diners must be fully vaccinated. Philadelphia, Boston, Minneapolis and St. Paul all have new vaccine requirements for indoor dining. They join cities including New York and San Francisco, which adopted such mandates last year. Some restaurants are opting to shut down their indoor dining operations and go back to takeout-only. Rise Bagel in Minneapolis this week alerted its customers that its dining room would close, citing the new requirements. ""We have made the tough decision to once again stack up our tables & chairs,"" the restaurant wrote in a Facebook message. ""We regret that we can't offer you a place to dine at this time."" An email seeking further comment was not immediately returned, but the restaurant later commented on the post, explaining that ""this decision was the best way to help our small and already strained team."" Many restaurants were already facing staffing shortages, and a number of eateries have closed temporarily because of positive coronavirus tests among staff or potential exposures. Since restaurants have reopened to indoor dining after the closures that marked the early-pandemic era, restaurant workers have often struggled to do their normal jobs while enforcing such rules as masking and social distancing, a dynamic that can create conflict with customers. Workers are having to take on roles that go way beyond their job descriptions, says Teofilo Reyes, chief program officer for the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, which advocates for better wages and working conditions in the industry. ""If you were hired to be a server, it shouldn't be your job to be a security enforcer,"" he says. His organization has received reports of workers being harassed merely because of their own mask-wearing, he noted, and confronting customers and asking them to comply with rules ï¿½?whether it's masking or showing proof of vaccination ï¿½?can be dangerous. Management should offer training and have someone on hand who can handle customers who resist, he said, so the servers and hostesses are not dealing with them on their own. And he recommends that restaurants communicate the rules to patrons so that would-be diners do not take out their frustrations on employees. In Washington, the Big Board, a burger joint located along the popular H Street district, appeared openly defiant of the new rules requiring restaurants to check proof of vaccination starting Jan. 15. ""As has always been the case for us, everyone is welcome,"" the restaurants tweeted ahead of the date. ""This rule applies yesterday, today and tomorrow. Hopefully we'll see you January 16th."" The restaurant was issued a verbal warning on Jan. 15 by Washington health officials for failing to require proof of vaccination and for not posting signs stating the rules.

It was terminated today,ï¿½?the story said. While the volume of public attention has been focused on the music videos of her Razzlekhan alter-ego, and the seemingly prolific career as a writer for major business publications, the advice she gave in her debut TikTok video is, indeed, reflective of the Silicon Valley mantra she said taught her everything she knows. âIt goes like this: Automate, eliminate, delegate, ok ï¿½?what does that mean?ï¿½?she said in the video. âFirst, you eliminate all the things that you donât need to do.

397,0,Criniti's is BACK: Iconic Italian restaurant will open its doors after a two year wait - here's when you can book a table,502 words,Mail Online,"* Local fans are already looking forward to the pastas and its famous desert pizza Italian food lovers in Sydney's west have been giving something to look forward to with the announcement on Tuesday that Criniti's restaurant is set to return by winter after a more than two year absence. The beloved chain's Parramatta branch shut very abruptly in late 2019, when it went into administration with debts of more than $16.5million. Seven of its 13 restaurants were forced to close at the time, including Parramatta in Sydney's west and the Manly branch on the city's northern beaches. Frank Criniti and his then wife Rima opened the first branch on Church Street, Parramatta in 2003 and continued to expand from there before hitting tough economic conditions in November 2019. Then, when it looked like there was a buyer who would keep it open, the Covid shutdown intervened and put it on hold. The business' assets were later sold to the South Australian Brunelli Group, which kept six outlets open - but not Parramatta. That will now be rectified and it will soon be back on Church St, albeit at a different address. The chain, whose slogan is 'When you're here, you're family', is moving into the former El-Phoenician Lebanese restaurant, which has shut after 24 years in business. Major renovations are being undertaken, including installing a woodfire pizza oven and trestle tables. With a lot of work to be done, it will still be several months before Criniti's is back in business in Parramatta, but its legion of local fans are already looking forward to the pizzas, pastas, gelatos and its famous desert pizza, which is much loved by children. The overhaul is expected to take several months but the money splashed on it has signalled a comeback for more Criniti's franchises across Sydney, where there are still six restaurants operating including Castle Hill, Wetherill Park and Darling Harbour. CRINITI'S: A BRIEF HISTORY Criniti's was founded in Parramatta, western Sydney in 2003 by Frank Criniti and his wife Rima. The chain opened more restaurants, eventually having 13 across Australia: Nine in NSW, two in VIC and one each in QLD and WA. In 2009 Rima and Frank divorced and he was left in charge. On 19 November, 2019 the chain went into administration with debts of $16.5million. A deal to save it fell through when the Covid pandemic hit. The South Australian Brunelli Group later bought it and kept six outlets open. In February 2022, it was announced the Parramatta branch would reopen on the same street, but at a different address."

In 2021-22, there has been a significant increase in export of several essential commodities over the corresponding fiscal of 2020-21, official sources said. While wheat exports went up by 54.50 per cent, rice exports rose by 9.24 per cent, coffee by 41.15 per cent, fruits and vegetables (9.91 per cent) and processed food items exports rose by 22 per cent in 2021-22 over the previous fiscal. With India having sufficient supply of wheat, it has also offered help to nations facing supply crisis and on Friday the government took the decision to send wheat shipments to Egypt. Several nations like Egypt are facing acute shortage of wheat due to the Russia-Ukraine war as the two embattled nations account for 29 per cent of global wheat exports. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had told NDTV last week that when exports go up, farmers also get competitive prices for their produce. When asked how he sees the changing scenario in the wake of Russia-Ukraine war which has impacted wheat availability, Tomar said, ""In the present scenario, India is ready and prepared to provide shipments of wheat to meet the needs in the international market. It is our endeavour that Indian farmers get a good market for their produce and their stock meets international standards in terms of production and quality."" Meanwhile according to Agriculture Ministry figures, in 2021-22, meat, dairy and poultry products have achieved more than 90 percent of their total export target.

""No one can even cut the grass on the land; this land belongs to the state."" Justice Minallah, addressing the government officials, said that ""lawlessness"" was taking place and that the events taking place in Islamabad were ""shocking"". ""Lawlessness is prevailing in Islamabad. The court continuously gives decisions and informs [officials],"" Justice Minallah remarked. He ordered the CDA to take over the Margalla Greens Golf Club and directed the chief commissioner Islamabad to seal the Monal Restaurant. The court asked the defence secretary to ensure that the Navy golf course is handed over to the CDA, no such thing takes place that can cause embarrassment and bring shame. The court asked the government official to take action against those responsible for encroaching upon the lands. ""You had already admitted that the golf course was illegal,"" he told the defence secretary. The court said that all the armed forces - army, navy, and air force - fall under the Ministry of Defence and they were not autonomous. Pakistan Navy encroached [upon the national park's land]. This is inappropriate. This will not portray a good image of the armed forces in the eyes of the people. ""The armed forces should not be controversial; it is not in the public interest,"" he said. Justice Minallah remarked that the court wanted people to look up to the armed forces. ""The laws are equally applicable on all the armed forces. ""Did the navy seek permission from the CDA for construction? It (navy) might have security reservations,"" he said, adding that relevant authorities should hear out the security concerns listed down by the defence secretary. The court declared the military's 8,000-acre claim on the national park's land as illegal and asked the AAG on what grounds was the land allotted to the military. The court ordered the CDA and the chief commissioner to point out the national park lands. The court said the land should be given back to the state. ""Only the elite benefit when there is lawlessness."" The IHC also directed the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency to prepare assessment report pertaining to losses caused by illegal constructions and also instructed the district collector for early completion of demarcation of Margalla Hills National Park. The IHC chief justice asked the secretary Ministry of Climate Change whether the ministry's responsibility was just to launch tree plantation campaigns. The ministry itself had admitted the encroachments by the private people in national park, he observed. Additional attorney general had adopted the stance that the ownership of the said land would remain with the federal government. The chief justice asked the secretary defence to conduct an inquiry and fix responsible for illegal construction of naval golf club. The CDA chairman informed the court that his department had given notice for demolishing the naval sailing club on directions of the bench. He said the district collector was responsible for demarcation of national park, while Survey of Pakistan and deputy commissioner offices would assist it. The CDA chairman said that changes were being introduced to the master plan of Islamabad after detailed deliberations. The court remarked that no one would dare to encroach on the government lands when the state institution would remove their possessions. The court asked how the Monal Restaurant was constructed, adding that Metropolitan Corporation should have not interfered in affairs of national park. The court remarked that after the 1960 Ordinance, 1400 square miles area belongs to the CDA, adding that the court would interpret many things in its judgment."

700,0,Facebook Has a Superuser-Supremacy Problem,2537 words,The Atlantic,"For more than a year, weâve been analyzing a massive new data set that we designed to study public behavior on the 500 U.S. Facebook pages that get the most engagement from users. Our research, part of which will be submitted for peer review later this year, aims to better understand the people who spread hate and misinformation on Facebook. We hoped to learn how they use the platform and, crucially, how Facebook responds. Based on prior reporting, we expected it would be ugly. What we found was much worse. [Read: Facebook is a Doomsday Machine[https://www-theatlantic-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/technology/archive/2020/12/facebook-doomsday-machine/617384/?utm_source=feed]] The most alarming aspect of our findings is that people like John, Michelle, and Calvin arenât merely fringe trolls, or a distraction from what really matters on the platform. They are part of an elite, previously unreported class of users that produce more likes, shares, reactions, comments, and posts than 99 percent of Facebook users in America. Theyâre superusers. And because Facebookâs algorithm rewards engagement, these superusers have enormous influence over which posts are seen first in other usersï¿½?feeds, and which are never seen at all. Even more shocking is just how nasty most of these hyper-influential users are. The most abusive people on Facebook, it turns out, are given the most power to shape what Facebook is.  Facebook activity is far more concentrated than most realize. The company likes to emphasize the breadth of its platform: nearly 2.9 billion monthly active users, visiting millions of public pages and groups. This is misleading. Our analysis shows that public activity is focused on a far narrower set of pages and groups, frequented by a much thinner slice of users. Top pages such as those of Ben Shapiro, Fox News, and Occupy Democrats generated tens of millions of interactions a month in our data, while all U.S. pages ranked 300 or lower in terms of engagement received less than 1 million interactions each. (The pages with the most engagement included examples from the far right and the far left, but right-wing pages were dominant among the top-ranked overtly political pages.) This winners-take-all pattern mirrors that seen in many other arenas, such as the dominance of a few best-selling books or the way a few dozen huge blue-chip firms dominate the total market capitalization of the S&P 500. On Facebook, though, the concentration of attention on a few ultra-popular pages has not been widely known. We analyzed two months of public activity from the 500 U.S.-run pages with the highest average engagement in the summer of 2020. The top pages lean toward politics, but the list includes pages on a broad mix of other subjects too: animals, daily motivation, Christian devotional content, cooking and crafts, and of course news, sports, and entertainment. User engagement fell off so steeply across the top 500, and in such a statistically regular fashion, that we estimate these 500 pages accounted for about half of the public U.S. page engagement on the platform. (We conducted our research with a grant from the nonprofit Hopewell Fund, which is part of a network of organizations that distribute anonymous donations to progressive causes. Officials at Hopewell were not involved in any way in our research, or in assessing or approving our conclusions. The grant we received is not attached to any political cause but is instead part of a program focused on supporting researchers studying misinformation and accountability on the social web.) Public groups differ from pages in several ways. Pages usually represent organizations or public figures, and only administrators are able to post content on them, while groups are like old-school internet forums where any user can post. Groups thus tend to have a much higher volume of posts, more comments, and fewer likes and sharesâbut they also follow a winners-take-all pattern, albeit a less extreme one. Because the number of group posts is so much larger, we analyzed groups more intensely over two weeks within that same two-month time frame in 2020, looking at tens of millions of the highest-interaction posts from more than 41,000 of the highest-membership U.S. public groups. [Adrienne LaFrance: âHistory will not judge us kindlyâ[https://www-theatlantic-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-papers-democracy-election-zuckerberg/620478/?utm_source=feed]] Overall, we observed 52 million users active on these U.S. pages and public groups, less than a quarter of Facebookâs claimed user base in the country. Among this publicly active minority of users, the top 1 percent of accounts were responsible for 35 percent of all observed interactions; the top 3 percent were responsible for 52 percent. Many users, it seems, rarely, if ever, interact with public groups or pages. As skewed as those numbers are, they still underestimate the dominance of superusers. Facebook users follow a consistent ladder of engagement. Low-public-activity users overwhelmingly do just one thing: They like a post or two on one of the most popular pages. As activity increases, users perform more types of public engagementâadding shares, reactions, and then commentsâand spread out beyond the most popular pages and groups. As we look at smaller and smaller pages and groups, then, we find that more and more of their engagement comes from the most avid users. Complete coverage of the smaller pages and tiniest groups we miss would thus paint an even starker picture of superuser supremacy. The dominance of superusers has huge implications beyond just our initial concern with abusive users. Perhaps the most important revelations that came from the former Facebook data engineer Frances Haugenâs trove[https://www-theatlantic-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/category/facebook-papers/?utm_source=feed] of internal documents[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039] concerned the inner workings of Facebookâs key algorithm, called âMeaningful Social Interaction,ï¿½?or MSI. Facebook introduced[https://about.fb.com/news/2018/01/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together/] MSI in 2018, as it was confronting declining engagement across its platform, and Zuckerberg hailed the change as a way to help âconnect with people we care about[https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571?pnref=story].ï¿½?Facebook reportedly tied employeesï¿½?bonuses to the measure[https://www-washingtonpost-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/technology/2021/10/05/facebook-senate-hearing-frances-haugen]. The basics of MSI are simple: It ranks posts by assigning points for different public interactions. Posts with a lot of MSI tend to end up at the top of usersï¿½?news feedsâand posts with little are, usually, never seen at all. According to The Wall Street Journal[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215], when MSI was first rolled out on the platform, a âlikeï¿½?was worth one point; reactions and re-shares were worth five points; ânonsignificantï¿½?comments were worth 15 points; and âsignificantï¿½?comments or messages were worth 30. A metric like MSI, which gives more weight to less frequent behaviors such as comments, confers influence on an even smaller set of users. Using the values referenced by The Wall Street Journal and drawing from Haugenâs documents, we estimate that the top 1 percent of publicly visible users would have produced about 45 percent of MSI on the pages and groups we observed, plus or minus a couple percent depending on what counts as a âsignificantï¿½?comment. Mark Zuckerberg initially killed changes to the News Feed proposed by Facebookâs integrity team, according to internal messages characterizing his reasoning, because he was worried about lower MSI[https://www-theatlantic-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-papers-democracy-election-zuckerberg/620478/?utm_source=feed]. Because activity is so concentrated, though, this effectively let hyperactive users veto the very policies that would have reined in their own abuse. Our data suggests that a majority of MSI on top U.S. pages came from about 700,000 users out of the more than 230 million users that Facebook claims to have in America. Facebook declined to answer our questions for this article, and instead provided this statement: âWhile weâre not able to comment on research we havenât seen, the small parts that have been shared with us are inaccurate and seem to fundamentally misunderstand how News Feed works. Ranking is optimized for what we predict each person wants to see, not what the most active users do.ï¿½? Facebookâs comments aside, it is well documented that the company has long used friendsï¿½?and general usersï¿½?activity as the key predictor of âwhat users want to see,ï¿½?and that MSI in particular has been Zuckerbergâs ânorth star.â[https://www-washingtonpost-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/technology/2021/10/25/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-whistleblower/] Various reporting shows how Facebook has repeatedly tweaked the weights of different MSI components, such as reaction emoji. Initially five points, they were dropped to four, then one and a half, then likes and loves were boosted to two while the angry emojiâs weight was dropped to zero. As The Atlantic first reported[https://www-theatlantic-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-papers-democracy-election-zuckerberg/620478/?utm_source=feed] last year, internal documents show that Facebook engineers say they found that reducing the weight of âangryï¿½?translated to a substantial reduction in hate speech and misinformation. Facebook says[https://www-theatlantic-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-papers-democracy-election-zuckerberg/620478/?utm_source=feed] it made that change permanent in the fall of 2020. An internal email[https://www-washingtonpost-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/technology/2021/10/26/facebook-angry-emoji-algorithm/] from January 2020 says that Facebook was rolling out a change that would reduce the influence strangers had on the MSI metric. Our research shows something different: None of this tweaking changes the big picture. The users who produce the most public reactions also produce the most likes, shares, and commentsâso re-weighting just reshuffles slightly which of the most active users matter more. Now that we can see that harmful behaviors come mostly from superusers, itâs very clear: So long as adding up different types of engagement remains a key ingredient in Facebookâs recommendation system, it amplifies the choices of the same ultra-narrow, largely hateful slice of users. So who are these people? To answer that question, we looked at a random sample of 30,000 users, out of the more than 52 million users we observed participating on these pages and public groups. We focused on the most active 300 by total interactions, those in the top percentile in their total likes, shares, reactions, comments, and group posts. Our review of these accounts, based on their public profile information and pictures, shows that these top users skew white, older, andâespecially among abusive usersâmale. Under-30 users are largely absent. Because the top 300 were all heavy users, three-quarters of them left at least 20 public comments over our two-month period, and some left thousands. We read as many of their comments as we could, more than 80,000 total. Of the 219 accounts with at least 25 public comments, 68 percent spread misinformation, reposted in spammy ways, published comments that were racist or sexist or anti-Semitic or anti-gay, wished violence on their perceived enemies, or, in most cases, several of the above. Even with a 6 percent margin of error, it is clear that a supermajority of the most active users are toxic. Top users pushed a dizzying and contradictory flood of misinformation. Many asserted that COVID does not exist, that the pandemic is a form of planned mass murder, or that it is an elaborate plot to microchip the population through âthe killer vaccination programï¿½?of Bill Gates. Over and over, these users declared that vaccines kill, that masks make you sick, and that hydroxychloroquine and zinc fix everything. The misinformation we encountered wasnât all about COVID-19âlies about mass voter fraud appeared in more than 1,000 comments. Racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, and anti-immigrant comments appeared constantly. Female Democratic politiciansâBlack ones especiallyâwere repeatedly addressed as âbitchï¿½?and worse. Name-calling and dehumanizing language about political figures was pervasive, as were QAnon-style beliefs that the world is run by a secret cabal of international child sex traffickers. In addition to the torrent of vile posts, dozens of top users behaved in spammy ways. We donât see large-scale evidence of bot or nonhuman accounts in our data, and comments have traditionally been the hardest activity to fake at scale. But we do see many accounts that copy and paste identical rants across many posts on different pages. Other accounts posted repeated links to the same misinformation videos or fake news sites. Many accounts also repeated one- or two-word commentsâoften as simple as âyesï¿½?or âYES !!ââdozens and dozens of times, an unusual behavior for most users. Whether this behavior was coordinated or not, these throwaway comments gave a huge boost to MSI, and signaled to Facebookâs algorithm that this is what users want to see. In many cases, this toxic mix of misinformation and hate culminated in fantasies about political violence. Many wanted to shoot, run over, hang, burn, or blow up Black Lives Matter protesters, âillegals,ï¿½?or Democratic members of Congress. They typically justified this violence with racist falsehoods or imaginary claims about antifa. Many top users boasted that they were ready for the seemingly inevitable violence, that they were buying guns, that they were âlocked and loaded.ï¿½?These disturbing comments were not just empty talk: Many of those indicted for participating in the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol also appear in our data. We were able to connect the first 380 individuals charged to 210 Facebook accounts; 123 of these were publicly active during the time our data set was constructed, and 51 left more than 1,200 comments total. The content of those comments mirrors the top 1 percent of users in their abusive languageâfurther illustrating the risk associated with pretending that harmful users are just a few bad apples among a more civil general user base. Recommendation algorithms change over time, and Facebook is notoriously secretive about its inner workings. Our research captures an important but still-limited snapshot of the platform. But so long as user engagement remains the most important ingredient in how Facebook recommends content, it will continue to give its worst users the most influence. And if things are this bad in the United States, where Facebookâs moderation efforts are most active[https://www-wired-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/story/facebooks-global-reach-exceeds-linguistic-grasp/], they are likely much worse everywhere else[https://www-theatlantic-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-failed-the-world/620479/?utm_source=feed]. Allowing a small set of people who behave horribly to dominate the platform is Facebookâs choice, not an inevitability. If each of Facebookâs 15,000 U.S. moderators[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51954968#:~:text=Facebook%20has%20approximately%2015%2C000%20content,content%20is%20inappropriate%20or%20harmful.] aggressively reviewed several dozen of the most active users and permanently removed those guilty of repeated violations, abuse on Facebook would drop drastically within days. But so would overall user engagement. Perhaps this is why we found that Facebook rarely takes action, even against the worst offenders. Of the 150 accounts with clear abusive behavior in our sample, only seven were suspended a year later. Facebook may publicly condemn users who post hate, spread misinformation, and hunger for violence. In private, though, hundreds of thousands of repeat offenders still rank among the most important people on Facebook."

908,1,"Thursdayâs TSX breakouts: An industrial focused REIT offering growth combined with an attractive yield of 6.2%; Itâs not cheap, but it has upside potential",1912 words,The Globe and Mail (Breaking News),"A brief outline on PROREIT is provided below that may serve as a springboard for further fundamental research when conducting your own due diligence. The REIT Headquartered in Montreal, PROREIT is focused on building a portfolio of industrial properties located in mid-sized cities across the country. As at Dec. 31, the REIT had a portfolio of 120 properties across 10 provinces with an occupancy rate of 98.4 per cent and a weighted average lease term of 4.6 years. In terms of geographical exposures, in the fourth-quarter 47.2 per cent of the REITâs base rent stemmed from the Maritime provinces, 27.5 per cent from Ontario, 15.5 per cent from Western Canada and 9.8 per cent from Quebec. The REITâs industrial sector exposure continues to significantly increase. In the fourth-quarter, 64 per cent of base rent was from industrial properties (up from 49.1 per cent during the same period last year), 25 per cent was from retail properties (down from 36 per cent last year), and 11 per cent was from office properties (down from 14.9 per cent during the fourth-quarter of 2020). The REITâs tenants are perceived by management as low-risk, high-quality tenants. The top ten tenants accounted for 30 per cent of base rent as at Dec. 31. The top six tenants were Rexall (4.5 per cent of base rent), Sobeys (4.3 per cent), Leonardo DRS (4 per cent of base rent), Sysco (3.4 per cent), the Government of Canada (3.3 per cent) and Shoppers Drug Mart (2.5 per cent). Investment thesis * Steady growth: management anticipates same-property net operating income (NOI) growth of between 2 per cent and 5 per cent in 2022. In 2021, same-property NOI increased 4.3 per cent year-over-year. * Asset value growth: management is focused on adding industrial properties to its portfolio. Management targets $2-billion in asset value in the next couple of years, up from the current value of its properties of approximately $1-billion. * Acquisition growth: In 2021, PROREIT acquired 34 properties (a purchase price of $296.9-million for these industrial assets) and sold five non-strategic properties. * Rising rents: the average rental increase was over 10 per cent for 97 per cent of the leases that matured in 2021. For leases that expire in 2022, management indicated in the earnings release that almost half of these leases have been renewed at a positive 10 per cent spread compared to maturing rates. * Cap rate compression: management expects cap rate compression will continue for the REITâs industrial portfolio. The weighted average cap rate was roughly 5.9 per cent at year-end, down 6.3 per cent sequentially (6.9 per cent for retail, 6.3 per cent for office and 5.9 per cent for industrial). * Strengthening its balance sheet: continued debt reduction remains a focus by management. * Valuation: potential multiple expansion, especially as the REIT continues to increase its industrial portfolio. * Attractive yield: above 6 per cent. * Potential risks to consider: 1) rising bond yields and 2) the REIT is not cheap. Quarterly earnings results On March 23, the REIT released its fourth-quarter financial results. Revenue came in at $22.9-million, up 30 per cent year-over-year. Net operating income rose to $13.4-million, up 33.6 per cent year-over-year. AFFO (adjusted funds from operations) totaled $7.4-million, up 37 per cent year-over-year. Same-property NOI increased 5.5 per cent year-over-year. At year-end, the debt-to-gross book value ratio declined to 53 per cent. Management aims to lower this ratio to below 50 per cent over the medium term. The following day, the unit price was relatively unchanged, declining by a penny to close at $7.06. On the earnings call, president and chief executive officer Jim Beckerleg provided a positive outlook for 2022, âWe continue to optimize our strong and flexible financial position, and I think we maintained a disciplined capital allocation. We intend to pursue our accretive growth in the industrial sector especially, focusing on midsized Canadian cities, where we believe rent growth opportunities remain very strong. We will do so well aiming to achieve the right balance between growth and quality of cash flows. We will also consider on an opportunistic basis with sale of some nonstrategic properties, mainly smaller buildings in the retail and office asset classes, which will result and further focus on our cash flows from the industrial sector. While optimizing the value and performance of our portfolio, this will also contribute to the decreasing of our leverage numbers.ï¿½?After the market closes on May 11, the REIT will be releasing its first-quarter financial results. According to Bloomberg, the Street is expecting PROREIT to report FFO (funds from operations) per unit of 13 cents. The following day, management will be hosting a conference call at 10:30 AM (ET). Distribution policy The REIT pays its unitholders a monthly distribution of 3.75 cents per unit, or 45 cents per unit on a yearly basis. This equates to a current annualized yield of 6.2 per cent. In the fourth-quarter, the AFFO payout ratio stood at 93 per cent. In 2021, the AFFO payout ratio was 90 per cent. Analystsï¿½?recommendations There are seven firms that provide research coverage on this small-cap REIT with a market capitalization of $427-million. The REIT has six buy recommendations and one âsector performï¿½?recommendation (by Scotiabank analyst Himanshu Gupta). The firms providing research coverage on PROREIT are as follows in alphabetical order: BMO Nesbitt Burns, Canaccord Genuity, CIBC World Markets, Haywood Securities, Laurentian Bank, Scotiabank, and TD Securities. Revised recommendations In March, five analysts revised their target prices ï¿½?all higher. * BMOâs Jenny Ma to $7.75 from $7.50. * Canaccordâs Mark Rothschild to $8 from $7.50. * CIBCâs Sumayya Syed to $8.25 (the high on the Street) from $7.50. * Scotiabankâs Himanshu Gupta to $7.75 from $7.25. * TDâs Lorne Kalmar to $8 from $7.50. Financial forecasts The consensus FFO per unit estimates are 54 cents for 2022, rising to 57 cents in 2023. The Street is expecting AFFO per unit of 51 cents in 2022 and 54 cents the following year. The Streetâs expectations have moderated slightly for 2022. For instance, three months ago, the consensus FFO per unit estimates were 57 cents for 2022 and 53 cents for 2023. The consensus AFFO per unit forecasts were 53 cents for 2022 and 53 cents for 2023. Valuation According to Bloomberg, the REIT is trading at a price-to-FFO multiple of 12.7 times the 2023 consensus estimate, which is above the five-year historical average multiple of 10.4 times and just below its peak multiple of approximately 13.1 times during this time period. The average 12-month target price is $7.95, implying the unit price has 10 per cent upside potential, including the yield the potential total return is 16 per cent. Individual target prices are: two at $7.75, $7.90, three at $8, and 8.25. Insider transaction activity Year-to-date, only one insider has reported trading activity in the public market. On March 30, chief financial officer Gordon Lawlor invested over $101,000 in units of PROREIT.

Chart watch Year-to-date, the unit price has increased 6.6 per cent, outperforming the S&P/TSX Composite Index, which is up 2.9 per cent, as well as the S&P/TSX Real Estate Sector Index, which is down 7.5 per cent. In terms of key technical resistance and support levels, the unit price has initial overhead resistance around $7.50. After that, there is a ceiling of resistance around $8.

117,1,Pembrokeshire employment figures rise,427 words,Western Telegraph,"In the south west Wales region, which covers three local authorities, 143,890 people were in payrolled employment in March, ONS figures show. This was up from 142,728 the month before and from 137,046 in March 2021. At the start of the pandemic, 138,618 people were in payrolled jobs in the area. Separate ONS figures also show there has been a fall in the number of people claiming unemployment benefits in the Pembrokeshire local authority area over the last year. Around 2,795 people were on out-of-work benefits as of March 10, down by 1,250 from 4,045 at the same point the year before. It meant 3.9 per cent of the area's working population sought support in March. The figures include those aged 16 to 64 on Jobseekerâs Allowance and some Universal Credit claimants, who are unemployed and seeking work or employed but with low earnings. Different figures show that across the UK, the unemployment rate hit 3.8 per centin the three months to February ï¿½?it has not been lower than this since 1974. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""The stats show the continued strength of our jobs market, with the number of employees on payrolls rising once again in March and unemployment falling further below pre-pandemic levels."" However, the ONS said real pay was now ""falling noticeably"", with regular wages, excluding bonuses, tumbling 1.8 per cent after inflation in the three months to February, the steepest decline in almost nine years. Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, called on the Chancellor to provide more support in the autumn budget, saying: ""The sheer scale of this inflation-led squeeze of living standards makes it all the more remarkable how little support the Chancellor provided in his spring statement"". Mr Sunak acknowledged this is a ""worrying time"" but highlighted the Â£22 billion in support that the Government is providing in 2022-23, including the Household Support fund. Employment minister Mims Davies added the Government is ""doing everything we can to help"", including supporting people in moving into better paid, higher skilled work and increasing the National Living and Minimum Wage."
194,0,"McDonald's , icon of post-Soviet era, to close all restaurants in Russia",690 words,Reuters News,"McDonald's said it would continue to pay salaries to its 62,000 employees in Russia. Because of its large size and global reach, the chain is often copied by other brands if it takes a stance on an issue or makes a major operational change. ""If they decide to do something, then probably others will follow,"" said international franchise consultant William Edwards of companies' conversations about whether to follow McDonald's by closing locations in Russia on moral grounds. Major global brands, including McDonald's and PepsiCo Inc , have been pressured to withdraw from Russia by consumers and investors including the New York state's pension fund. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""  McDonald's opened in Pushkin Square 32 years ago as the Soviet Union was collapsing. That new restaurant represented the thawing Cold War tensions at a time when some young Russians were desperate to get their hands on blue jeans and other Americana. ""It's impossible to predict when we might be able to reopen our restaurants in Russia,"" McDonald's CEO, Chris Kempczinski , said in a note emailed companywide on Tuesday and posted on the company's website. ""We are experiencing disruptions to our supply chain along with other operational impacts. We will also closely monitor the humanitarian situation."" Paul Musgrave, a University of Massachusetts political science professor, said the McDonald's closures show how the quick and broad imposition of Western sanctions on Russia will have a lasting economic impact. He also said the decision puts to rest the theory that business ties will inevitably lead to closer U.S.-Russian relations. ""It's the spiritual end to any hope that commercial ties by themselves would sustain political integration."" Added Jeffrey Sonnenfeld , a professor at the Yale School of Management who is tracking major companies' stances on Russia: ""I'm so glad that they realized it's a complicated situation, and I'm glad they came around and made the right decision ... It's a really important impact, and it's symbolic as much as it is substantive."" Of its nearly 850 Russian McDonald's locations, 84% are owned by the company. The remainder are mostly operated by Moscow-based franchisee Rosinter Restaurants Holding . COMPLEXITIES Because McDonald's owns many locations in Russia, it has more direct access to shutting operations. That may not be as easy for other fast-food chains in Russia - including Yum Brands Inc's KFC and Pizza Hut , Restaurant Brands International 's Burger King , Subway, Papa John's International Inc , Starbucks Corp and Domino's Pizza Inc . The companies' Russian locations are almost entirely run by independent operators and subject to complex international franchise agreements. For example, Burger King 's owner, Restaurant Brands, on Tuesday told Reuters that because Burger King ""is a stand-alone business owned and operated by franchisees in Russia,"" the company has ""long-standing legal agreements that are not easily changeable in the foreseeable future."" Some fast-food franchisees with locations in Russia are not even based in Russia, such as Netherlands-based DP Eurasia , which runs Domino's restaurants in Russia, as well as in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia. ""These are often long, complicated, heavily negotiated agreements. Every one of them can be different from everyone else,"" said Larry Weinberg, who chairs the franchise practice at the law firm Cassels Brock & Blackwell LLP .

310,1,Kazakhstan sees increase in state debt,368 words,Regional Finances,"""I believe that the National Fund cannot be considered only as a guaranteed reserve for repayment of loans,"" Bekenov noted. Today there are 52 external government loans totaling $112.2 billion, while the development was only 80 percent, the senator emphasized. ""Among the key factors in the increase in the country's external debt are inefficient use, lack of demand for borrowed money, cancellation of part of the loan, also attraction of money by quasi-state companies for non-productive purposes,"" Bekenov added. ""Subsidiary of KazMunayGas JSC (KMG) attracted a loan for a period of three years in the amount of $300 million for the purpose of further distribution to shareholders in the form of dividends in 2017, in the presence of own funds. This loan was attracted to pay dividends. These are just some examples of inefficient planning and use of international loans,"" the MP said. Nurlan Bekenov announced a number of systemic measures that were developed during a meeting of senators with representatives of state authorities and the quasi-state sector on the effectiveness of external state loans, to improve the current situation, among them, the implementation of constant monitoring of the procurement process and contract management, improving the quality of projects under development to eliminate their further irrelevance. ""It is important to attract external loans through the prism of a critical analysis of current areas of financing, clear regulation of the cost of design estimates and prioritization of costs in all sectors of the economy,"" Bekenov added."
225,0,"As Olympic torch is lit in hope, I see light at end of the tunnel",790 words,The Herald,"When Ivy League universities in America are closing their doors and sending students home until August, donât rule out the first cancellation of an Olympic Games since World War II.? The IOC and host nation Japan are still confident that the Games will go ahead as planned, but no one has any real idea on how long this might go on for. Just from athletes I have spoken to, there is definitely real concern over the Games. The concern isnât just over whether the games get cancelled or not. For each individual athlete, it is also over their own preparations. As an athlete, getting sick is never great and if you got this virus bad you might face missing weeks of training. It could result on you missing the podium in Tokyo.? Or missing the Games altogether. Another friend of mine told me of his concerns that if they move the Games then he might not even get selected.? With markets crashing and supermarket shelves being cleared, these are definitely interesting times for everybody. But when you are living during this Covid-19 pandemic with a spinal-cord injury I guess it becomes even more daunting ï¿½?as such an injury can remove your cough and sneeze reflex. With very little core function, the thought of not being able to cough is a pretty scary proposition.? This might not sound too bad. But this virus hits elderly people hard ï¿½?and this also includes your biological age due to underlying medical conditions. So this is a scary time, and I completely feel for everyone in the same boat as me how scary this is.?I remember back to catching the flu in November last year ï¿½?I thought I was going to stop breathing. I couldnât cough to clear my lungs as the level of my injury is right at the nerves which go to the lungs.? It knocked me out for weeks, so I would be lying if I said I wasnât slightly scared of Covid-19 and its possible effects on my lungs.? I am a very optimistic person who always looks for solutions over problems. But I must admit this has got me a little bit shaken.? Watching whatâs happening in Italy has been hard to believe ï¿½?particularly as life seemed to be continuing almost as normal here.? I looked at the MRI of a 44-year-old manâs lungs and it was unbelievable, unfortunately he didnât survive.? So I am staying positive but also taking advice from Austrian neurologist Viktor Frankl.?He speaks of acceptance of your current situation. These are his own words ï¿½?which I have had on my wall for the last four years: âThe meaning of life lies in finding a purpose and taking responsibility for ourselves and other human beings.ï¿½? In other words, by having a clear âwhyï¿½?we can face all the âhowï¿½?questions of life. This has got me through all those hours in hospital and continues to serve me daily.? Thereâs a reason that in-flight safety presentations always instruct us to secure our own oxygen masks before assisting fellow passengers. We canât help others effectively unless we first protect ourselves. So I spoke with a medical oncologist friend and they advised me to self-isolate.? I am now on day four and thinking this could be a long road ahead; thankfully the weather is getting warmer and I got out on my bike for a few laps of Richmond Park. Along with indoor turbo sessions I am well prepared mentally for the process. I guess all my time in hospital equipped my mind to deal with self-isolating. It also probably helps being an introvert.? I canât help but think of the poor people undergoing their cancer treatment right now though, as I prepare for my own hospital appointment in a few weeks, but I am grateful that side of things is under control. My main goal is keeping my immune system strong because another issue I have from my spinal-cord injury is a compromised immune system, thus moving me into a vulnerable group.? Itâs hard to go from a strong athlete to now feeling so vulnerable, but thankfully I have a strong mind."

404,0,Do right by foreign workers to preserve Hong Kong's competitive advantage,1058 words,scmp.com,"In recent decades, Hong Kongâs competitive advantage has been built upon diverse foundations. Some are obvious and repeated ad nauseam ï¿½?low and simple tax rates, trusted legal system, unique access to the mainland and so on. But some are noticed less often and taken for granted until Covid-19 struck, such as our army of foreign domestic workers[https://www.scmp.com/topics/foreign-domestic-workers-hong-kong]. They make up more than 9 per cent of our workforce and provide support in at least 275,000 Hong Kong homes. Paid a pittance and often working long hours in claustrophobic circumstances, they make it possible for tens of thousands of Hong Kong mothers to pursue meaningful, well-paid careers, strengthening our local skills pool for the thousands of international companies based here. It has enabled Hong Kong to achieve a 54 per cent female workforce participation rate. That is behind Singapore, but on a par with Japan and well ahead of the global average of around 47 per cent.

But Hong Kongâs strict ""zero Covidï¿½?strategy has turned this formerly well-oiled system topsy-turvy. The ban on flights[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3163344/hong-kong-social-distancing-ban-evening-dine] from the Philippines ï¿½?the source of many of Hong Kongâs helpers ï¿½?has left thousands of helpers stuck in the Philippines. Whether they were back home on leave or waiting for flights to start new contracts, they are now stranded and will remain that way until flights are resumed. Even when flights start afresh, they face two weeks of quarantine. A shortage of quarantine hotel rooms[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3162809/hong-kong-provide-additional-150-quarantine-hotel] makes even this process uncertain. The disruption has left thousands of Hong Kong families without home help and has sparked a price war over helpers that are already here in Hong Kong. With a shortfall of an estimated 50,000 helpers, accusations of ""job-hopping[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3156503/hong-kong-domestic-workers-abusing-post-contract-grace] ï¿½?have flared. Anecdotal accounts report families offering monthly salaries of HK$6,000 (US$770) and more to poach helpers who are in normal times earning just HK$4,630 a month[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3150735/hong-kong-freezes-domestic-helper-wages-second-straight-year]. While the disruption in Hong Kong is severe and still unresolved, the disruption in the Philippines itself could be greater. That is because of the countryâs reliance on its bagong bayani, or heroes, as the countryâs army of overseas workers are called. According to the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, around 2.2 million Filipinos work overseas. Around 12 per cent of Filipino families rely on remittances from at least one bagong bayani.  Remittances in 2019[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3043329/more-domestic-helpers-hong-kong-using-online-platforms-send] ï¿½?the last ""normalï¿½?year before Covid-19 struck ï¿½?amounted to about US$33.5 billion, equivalent to about 10 per cent of the countryâs GDP. At a time when unemployment inside the Philippines is 6.5 per cent, reliance on remittances in many areas is critical. This puts the Philippines among the leading countries that receive overseas worker remittances, behind India, China and Mexico. Because its economy is so much smaller than the leading three, its economic reliance on remittances[https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3084642/coronavirus-threatens-philippines-economic-lifeline-ofw] is without parallel. The economic turbulence arising from the global pandemic has sent alarms ringing through the corridors of power in Manila and through millions of families. Hong Kong thankfully appears to be an outlier, though, and remittances overall have remained more resilient than expected. Against predictions during the direst months in the middle of 2020 that remittances might fall by 13 per cent or more, figures from the Philippines central bank at the end of 2021 suggest a life-saving recovery since the nadir in 2020. They now predict a fall of just 0.8 per cent. Why is this? First, Hong Kong is an insignificant outlier. It accounts for just 7 per cent of all Filipino overseas workers, compared with more than 20 per cent working in Saudi Arabia, 13 per cent in the United Arab Emirates and almost 220,000 seafarers who staff the worldâs merchant ships and cruise ships. Also, because Hong Kongâs domestic workers are almost all young women from abroad, they are among the cityâs least-well-paid overseas workers. Those in the Middle East[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/2184893/saudi-arabia-encouraged-foreign-workers-leave-and-resulting] are more likely to be male and thus more likely to fill managerial or professional roles where pay is much better. Despite Covid-related upheavals in Saudi Arabia[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3108499/saudi-arabia-ease-curbs-migrant-workers-it-reforms] and the UAE, where there were reports of large numbers of early terminations of foreign workers in 2020, there appears to have been a strong recovery since then. Most significant of all has been a rise in remittances from the United States, where the large community of Filipino emigrants appears to have responded powerfully to calls for help from relatives back home. As a World Bank blog noted last November: ""It is remarkable to see the recovery in remittance flows in 2021, proving again their reliability as an absolute lifeline for families of migrants back home, especially in times of need.ï¿½?For now, families back in the Philippines have found some relief. Whether this can be sustained is another matter. Unemployment within the country remains high. Many of the stranded overseas workers can find no work at home and see no early prospect of returning to their jobs overseas or on cruise ships. The upheavals here in Hong Kong need to be resolved as speedily as possible, not just for the sake of thousands of families in the Philippines but for thousands of families here in Hong Kong. And there is that other, not-insignificant matter of maintaining an essential competitive advantage that has for decades been largely ignored.

749,0,EXCLUSIVE: Now Washington Post reverses course! Paper joins NYT in finally admitting Hunter Biden's laptop IS REAL - nine months after it first received - and dismissed - a copy of the hard drive and ONE YEAR after DailyMail.com authenticated it,1820 words,Mail Online,"* The Post said it had cyber forensics experts validate its material, using similar methods experts hired by DailyMail.com used back in March 2021 * Hunter's Macbook Pro was recovered in October 2020 after he left it at a repair shop in Wilmington, Delaware in April 2019 and never returned for it * Earlier this month, DailyMail.com revealed that the Post received a copy of the laptop from political activist Jack Maxey last June and again in October but ignored it * 'They haven't done anything. They're not just late to the party, they didn't even show up,' said Maxey, who gave DailyMail.com the laptop last spring * The Post's admission also follows the New York Times, which quietly noted 1,200 words into a long story this month that it had also validated the device's material The Washington Post has finally admitted Hunter Biden's laptop is real, nine months after first receiving a copy and a full year after DailyMail.com authenticated it. The Post had cyber forensics experts validate material on the abandoned laptop hard drive, using similar methods that experts hired by DailyMail.com used back in March 2021. After months of publishing articles suggesting the laptop could be Russian disinformation, the analysis published by the newspaper on Wednesday marks a startling u-turn. Its admission also follows the New York Times, which quietly noted 1,200 words into a long story published earlier this month that it had also validated material from the laptop. Neither newspaper acknowledged that DailyMail.com had authenticated its contents with a forensic analysis by top cyber experts a year earlier, and has been regularly publishing revelations based on that material ever since. In its Wednesday piece [https://www-washingtonpost-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/technology/2022/03/30/hunter-laptop-methodology/], the Post claimed it tried to get hold of a copy in October 2020 but failed, and didn't get its hands on the laptop drive until June 2021, when Jack Maxey gave them a copy. Maxey, a former co-host of ex-Donald Trump advisor Steve Bannon's podcast the War Room, also gave DailyMail.com a copy in February last year ï¿½?and has been doggedly trying to get the US's two most prestigious papers to investigate its contents ever since. The Post accidentally deleted their first copy and had to get Maxey to fly out to their Washington DC office with a new one in October last year, he said. 'I'm not going to disclose the details of our conversations, but I gave them a copy of it in June. I personally delivered it to their offices and met with senior editors,' Maxey told DailyMail.com. 'I had to go a second time in October because they broke the first copy. 'They haven't done anything [until now]. They're not just late to the party, they didn't even show up.' Photos provided by Maxey show him at the newspaper's offices, and a copy of the laptop hard drive lying on the Post's boardroom table. The Post spent months ignoring stories arising from the laptop and prominently reporting claims that it was 'Russian disinformation'. An 'explainer' piece published in October 2020 played down major revelations including that Joe Biden met with Hunter's business partners, but has since been updated to reflect the paper's new position ï¿½?admitting that at least some of the material on the laptop is real. A story based on the laptop's contents published by the newspaper on Wednesday focuses on the millions of dollars Hunter and his uncle, Joe Biden's brother Jim, received from their partnership with a Chinese government-linked oil behemoth CEFC. The story, which has been previously reported by DailyMail.com and others, includes documents showing Hunter was paid a $1million retainer in 2017 to represent his business partner Patrick Ho, who was being prosecuted by the US government. Other documents show CEFC wired the Biden family a total $5million. One startling email among those now validated by the Post indicates the president could have been involved in Hunter's business dealings with the Chinese. In September 2017 Hunter was planning to open a new office for his multi-million-dollar joint venture with CEFC at the House of Sweden, a Georgetown building home to the Swedish embassy. He wrote to a building manager: 'please have keys made available for new office mates: Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Jim Biden, Gongwen Dong (Chairman Ye CEFC emissary). 'I would like the office sign ton [sic] reflect the following: The Biden Foundation, Hudson West (CEFC US).' 'We are very excited and honored to welcome your new colleagues!' the manager replied. Biden Foundation board member Jeffrey Peck told the Post: 'There was never any thought ï¿½?like zero thought or consideration ï¿½?given to that building.' The House of Sweden said they made the keys but Hunter never picked them up. The Post's admission, hot on the heels of that of the New York Times, coincides with an apparent growing momentum in Hunter's federal prosecution over reported tax fraud, money laundering and illegal foreign lobbying allegations.  The New York Times reported that material from the laptop is part of the FBI's evidence in the case. Prosecutors have subpoenaed several of Hunter's associates, including a former employee Lunden Roberts, with whom he fathered a baby. Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz grilled the assistant director of the FBI's Cyber Division over the whereabouts of the laptop in a House Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday. After a battle with Democrats on the committee, Gaetz then entered a copy of the laptop drive as evidence, and tweeted calling for the president's son to be subpoenaed. Hunter abandoned his laptop at a Delaware computer store in 2019. John Paul Mac Isaac, the store owner, gave a copy of its hard drive to Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani in September 2020, after handing over the original to the FBI the previous year. Giuliani reportedly leaked documents and photos from the drive to the New York Post, and also gave a whole copy of the drive to Bannon and his podcast co-host Maxey. The New York Post published excerpts of emails and photos from the laptop ahead of the 2020 election, but without authentication they were widely dismissed as fake or 'Russian disinformation'. In spring last year DailyMail.com hired Brad Maryman, an expert who founded the FBI's cyber forensics unit, and his firm Maryman & Associates to analyze the laptop. Their report showed the laptop was real. From then on, DailyMail.com began to reveal its sordid and potentially incriminating contents over the following year. Using the same forensic tools as federal and state law enforcement in criminal investigations, Maryman & Associates found a total of 103,000 text messages, 154,000 emails and more than 2,000 photos on the hard drive. The Washington Post hired Matt Green, a Johns Hopkins University security researcher who specializes in cryptography, and Jake Williams, a forensics expert and former National Security Agency operative who once hacked the computers of foreign adversaries, to conduct two separate analyses. According to the Post, they found 286,000 'individual user files', but were only able to verify 22,000 of the emails on the drive using cryptographic signatures in the headings of the messages. Williams found '36,000 images, more than 36,000 iMessage chat entries, more than 5,000 text files and more than 1,300 videos.' The Post did not mention that other devices including Biden family members' iPhones and iPads had been backed up to Hunter's laptop, creating other points of validation for its contents. The sheer volume, interconnectedness and consistency of the data was a major factor in Maryman & Associates coming to their conclusion over its authenticity. AUTHENTICATING HUNTER'S LAPTOP DailyMail.com commissioned cyber forensics experts at Maryman & Associates to examine the hard drive to determine its authenticity. The firm's founder, Brad Maryman, was a 29-year veteran of the FBI, served as a Chief Information Security Officer and founded the bureau's cyber forensics unit. His partner, Dr. Joseph Greenfield, is an associate professor at the University of Southern California and helped write their degree program in intelligence and cyber operations. After an extensive analysis of the hard drive, Greenfield and Maryman produced a report for DailyMail.com detailing their findings. Using the same forensic tools as federal and state law enforcement in criminal investigations, they found a total of 103,000 text messages, 154,000 emails and more than 2,000 photos. - They found emails for multiple accounts on the laptop dating back to 2009, and other data which 'appears to be related to Mr. Biden' between 2016 and 2019. - The report's findings were consistent with the known timeline for the hard drive. A Wilmington, Delaware computer store work order with Hunter's signature shows he left his 2017 MacBook Pro laptop there on April 12, 2019. - The Maryman & Associates report said the original 'Macintosh HD' drive was created on March 28, 2018 - Hunter's iCloud email address was added to the laptop's system on October 21 2018, as well as his work email at his firm Rosemont Seneca on February 2 2019. - The same day, a Gmail address he used to log onto sex cam sites, and another personal Gmail address belonging to Hunter, were also added. - Beau Biden's old Gmail account was added on February 7 2019. - Emails addressed to Hunter's various email addresses dating from December 2009 to December 2020 were found on the system. - An iPad with the name 'Hunter's iPad' and three email addresses associated with the Biden family was backed up on the laptop and on iCloud in January 2019 and again a month later. - Greenfield found 818 call logs in this iPad backup with timestamps from June 2016 to February 2019. - There were 8,942 entries in the iPad's contacts book, created between April 2016 and January 2019. - In February 2019 an iPhone XS was also synced with the laptop. Its serial number was consistent with the timestamps of the data on the phone. In conclusion, 'The operating system timestamps appear to be authentic, and no evidence was found to suggest that the timestamps or data were altered or manufactured,' the report said. 'No indications were found that would suggest the data was manufactured.'"
920,1,Volkswagen Shares Fall After Warning on Ukraine War Impact -- Update,365 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"The German company, whose portfolio includes the Porsche and Audi brands, cautioned on the war's continuing effects on exchange rates and commodity markets, and said the impact couldn't be predicted with certainty. ""There is therefore still a risk that further developments in the Ukraine war will have a negative impact on the Volkswagen Group's business activities,"" it said. The company warned that supply bottlenecks could arise from the war as well as from the coronavirus pandemic. Over the past two years, Volkswagen has repeatedly seen its production disrupted due to factors including a shortage of semiconductors amid the pandemic and, more recently, bottlenecks in the supply of wiring harnesses due to the war in Ukraine. At 1014 GMT, Volkswagen preference shares were trading 2.2% lower at EUR148.18. For the first-quarter, the car maker expects an operating profit before special items of around 8.5 billion euros ($9.26 billion), with an operating return on sales of around 13.5%, based on preliminary data. Volkswagen said its operating performance in the three-month period was robust and earnings were also boosted by positive valuation effects related to commodity-hedging instruments. Net cash flow in the automotive division was around EUR1.5 billion for the quarter. In the first quarter of 2021, when there were no special items, Volkswagen posted EUR4.81 billion in operating profit and an operating return on sales of 7.7%.  Volkswagen's adjusted operating profit for the first three months of this year appears to be in line with expectations, while the free cashflow looks to be below estimates, RBC Capital Markets' Tom Narayan said in a note.  Volkswagen plans to post full results on May 4.

Saget, 65, was found by staff in his room at The Ritz-Carlton, Orlando, at 4pm on Sunday. The cause of his death remains unknown. Police say there were no obvious signs of foul play or drug use, but a toxicology report is yet to be carried out. He was found hours after posting jubilantly about returning to the stage, and how he was loving being back in the limelight after a show at the Ponte Vedra Concert Hall in Jacksonville on Saturday night. 'Okay, I loved tonightâs show in Jacksonville. Really nice audience. Lots of positivity. Happened last night in Orlando last night at the Hard Rock Live too. Very appreciative and fun audiences.

The Orange County Sheriff's Office told TMZ[https://www.tmz.com/2022/01/09/bob-saget-dead-dies-hotel-comedian-full-house/] that it has 'no information on cause of death, and detectives have found no signs of foul play or drug use in this case.' Saget is believed to have been healthy. He was fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and told fans that he got his booster shot a month ago. Tributes rushed in for the comedy star with Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who took turns playing his youngest daughter on Full House, describing Saget as 'the most loving, compassionate and generous man.'

We are thinking of his daughters, wife and family and are sending our condolences.' Saget's Full House costar John Stamos wrote that he was 'broken' and 'gutted' after hearing the news. 'I am in complete and utter shock. I will never ever have another friend like him. I love you so much Bobby,' he lamented on Twitter. The star is survived by his wife Kelly Rizzo, whom he married in 2018, and his three children ï¿½?Aubrey, 34; Lara, 32; and Jennifer, 29 ï¿½?all of whom he shared with his first wife Sherri Kramer, whom he was married to from 1982 to 1997. His family paid tribute to their 'beloved Bob', saying they were 'devastated' by his passing. 'He was everything to us and we want you to know how much he loved his fans, performing live and bringing people from all walks of life together with laughter. 'Though we ask for privacy at this time, we invite you to join us in remembering the love and laughter that Bob brought to the world,' a statement said. Police said in a statement: 'On 1/9/2022, just after 4 p.m., deputies responded to the 4000 block of Central Florida Parkway (Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes) in response to a man down call. 'On arrival, they located a man who was unresponsive in a hotel room. The man, identified as Robert Lane Saget, was pronounced deceased on scene. We have no information on cause of death, and detectives have found no signs of foul play or drug use in this case.' The cause of death is yet to be determined and police 'do not anticipate' that further information will be given at this time. The statement continued: 'This is all the information we have for release at this time and we do not anticipate further updates. The Medical Examiner's Office will ultimately determine cause and manner of death.' The comedian's unexpected death comes amid his cross-country stand-up tour, which kicked off back in September 2021. He had recently played a string of dates in Florida, including a show in Orlando. The comedy icon began his career as a stand-up in his hometown of Philadelphia, before heading west to Los Angeles. He went on to have a string of small parts in films starting in the late 1970s, but it wasn't until a decade later that he became a household name. Although he developed a reputation among his fellow stand-up comedians for his profane comedy sets, Saget paradoxically had his greatest success with the heartwarming sitcom Full House. He starred on the ABC series as Danny Tanner from 1987 through 1995, and then led the Netflix sequel series Fuller House for five seasons from 2016 to 2020. In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper from July 2021, Saget revealed that he never expected to lean into cleaner comedy shows like Full House. 'Full House was an accident,' he said. 'I got fired on CBS and was asked to be in Full House.' Saget played a widowed sports anchor who moves in with his late wife's brother Jesse (John Stamos) and his childhood friend Joey (Dave Coulier) as they help him raise his three daughters, played by Candace Cameron, Jodie Sweetin and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who split the role of Michelle Tanner. 'My heart is broken,' said Dave Coulier, who played a comedian on Full House. 'I love you, Bob. Your forever brother, Dave.' Andrea Barber, who played Kimmy Gibbler on Full House and its sequel series, shared a sweet still from Fuller House of herself hugging Saget to mark his death. 'This one hurts,' she began her lengthy caption. 'He had the biggest heart of anyone in Hollywood. He gave the biggest hugs. I am gutted that I will never be able to hug him again. 'Bob ended every text, every interaction with 'Love you.' Didn't matter how long or short we'd been apart. He loved so deeply and so fiercely,' she continued. 'And he never hesitated to tell you just how much you meant to him. This is the greatest lesson I learned from Bob Saget ï¿½?don't hesitate to tell people you love them. I feel at peace knowing that Bob knew exactly how much I adore him.' She concluded: 'Rest well, my dear friend. I have no doubt you are making everyone in Heaven laugh until their cheeks hurt, just as you did here on Earth â¤ï¸.' Candace Cameron Bure, who played the actor's daughter D.J. Tanner on Full House, was left speechless after learning of his death. 'I don't know what to say [broken-hearted emoji]. I have no words,' she tweeted. 'Bob was one of the best human beings I've ever known in my life. I loved him so much.' The comedian played up his family-friendly bona fides by concurrently starring on America's Funniest Home Videos from 1989 through 1997. He hosted the series, which collected humorous home videos sent in by fans, and also provided voiceovers for the clips to ramp up the comedy. Although he didn't appear in front of the camera, Saget's recognizable voice narrated another ABC sitcom, How I Met Your Mother, in which he played an older version of Ted Mosby (played on-screen by Josh Radnor). Radnor eulogized his colleague in a Twitter thread, culminating with a smiley photo of the two. Like so many others, he described his friend as 'the kindest, loveliest, funniest, most supportive man' and a 'mensch among mensches.' The actor and comedian poked fun at his image with a recurring role on HBO's Entourage, and he also led the single-season WB sitcom Raising Dad, which featured rising stars Kat Dennings and Brie Larson with Sopranos fixture Jerry Adler. Dennings expressed her sorrow at news of her former costars death on Sunday. 'Oh god. Bob Saget!!! The loveliest man. I was his TV daughter for one season and he was always so kind and protective. So so sorry for his family,' she tweeted. Saget wasn't afraid to get a bit silly, and one of his recent appearances was as a disguised figure on The Masked Singer. He focused more on his preferred brand of comedy in recent years with his podcast Bob Saget's Here For You, which he began recording in 2020. Other small but impactful roles include an uncredited part as a cocaine addict in Dave Chappelle's 1998 stoner comedy Half Baked, and he was one of the many comedians featured in the documentary The Aristocrats, about the infamous foul comedy routine of the title. When he wasn't on stage or in front of the camera, Saget also tried his hand at directing. He helmed the Norm Macdonaldâstarring comedy Dirty Work, which was reviled by critics but later reevaluated as a cult classic, and he provided voices for and directed the straight-to-video parody film Farce Of The Penguins. Last year, Rizzo revealed on Instagram that the couple had spent their first Christmas together, despite having been married multiple years. 'So happy to spend my very first Christmas with @BobSaget (even though we've been married over 3 years!) because he's finally in Chicago for the holidays!' she captioned a cute photo of the couple holding hands in front of a Chinese dragon statue. Shortly before his death, Saget mused about the nature of the afterlife while paying tribute to Betty White after she died just days away from her 100th birthday. 'I don't know what happens when we die, but if Betty says you get to be with the love of your life, then I happily defer to Betty on this,' he wrote, noting the actress' undying love for her late husband Allen Ludden, who died in 1981. Saget managed to be an unending source of humor for his fans despite several family tragedies earlier in life. His sister Andrea died of a brain aneurysm in 1985, and his other sister Gay died from the autoimmune disease scleroderma in 1994. In a 2019 interview with NIH Medline Plus Magazine[https://magazine-medlineplus-gov.proxy.library.nyu.edu/article/dont-give-up-hope], Saget revealed he had been working with the Scleroderma Research Foundation even prior to his sister's diagnosis. The disease leads to hardening of the skin and connective tissue, and the TV star described it as 'incredibly painful,' adding that his family was 'still having post-traumatic stress disorder' from caring for his sister in her final days. His experience with the disease later inspired him to direct the TV Movie For Hope, which starred Dana Delany as a woman diagnosed with the same illness that killed his sister. Following news of Saget's death, tributes began flowing in from his famous friends and admirers, most of whom noted Saget's warmth and kindness. Although SNL star Pete Davidson doesn't have his own social media accounts, he had a friend share a statement online in which he revealed that Saget had had played an essential role in helping him with mental health issues. 'Bob Saget was one of the nicest men on the planet,' he began. 'When I was younger and several times throughout our friendship he helped me get through some rough mental health stuff. He stayed on the phone with my mom for hours trying to help in anyway he can ï¿½?connecting us with doctors and new things we can try,' he continued. 'He would check in on me and make sure I was okay. 'I love you Bob it was an honor to know you. Thank you for your kindness and friendship. My condolences to the family.' Jim Carrey memorialized the late comedian with a black-and-white photo of the two in their early years. He called Saget 'beautiful' and added, 'He had a big, big heart and a wonderfully warped comic mind. He gave the world a lot of joy and lived his life for goodness' sake.' Adam Sandler called Saget a 'great man' and 'funny as hell,' adding, 'Such a nice person. Love to Bob and his whole family.' The Office star B.J. Novak, who had appeared on Bob Saget's Here For You earlier in January, reacted to the news with a simple broken-hearted emoji. On January 3, he had retweeted a clip from his episode and serenaded the late comic: 'I have always and will always love Bob Saget.' Billy Crystal was 'shocked and saddened' to learn of Saget's death. He called him 'A great friend and one of the funniest and sweetest people I have ever known.' 'Sail on my friend Bob Saget With your huge heart and abject lunacy,' Whoopi Goldberg wrote. 'My condolences to his daughters & other family.' Saget's friend and fellow comic Gilbert Gottfried shared a photo of the two warmly embracing in his tribute post. 'Still in shock. I just spoke with Bob a few days ago,' he wrote. 'We stayed on the phone as usual making each other laugh. RIP to friend, comedian & fellow Aristocrat Bob Saget.' Former Daily Show host Jon Stewart simply wrote that Saget was 'Just the funniest and nicest...' Watch What Happens Live host Andy Cohen tweeted that the Full House star 'had the biggest heart and wore it on his sleeve.' 'He was so generous with his feelings. A mensch,' he added. Danny DeVito wrote, 'So sad about Bob Saget. Rest in Peace.' Legendary television writer and producer Norman Lear was beaming ear-to-ear in a throwback photo he posted featuring Saget. 'Bob Saget was as lovely a human as he was funny. And to my mind, he was hilarious. We were close friends and I could not have loved him more,' he wrote. Star Trek's George Takei wrote that he was 'saddened to learn of the untimely passing of comedian Bob Saget,' whom he said was a 'regular presence in our living rooms, bring to us the funniest videos and countless belly laughs.' 'Gone too soon, like so many of the brightest souls,' he added. Henry Winkler alluded to Saget's risquÃ© stand-up comedy in his tribute. 'BOB ... it was great to know you ... Oh are you going to make God blush,' he joked. Community star Joel McHale wrote that he was 'shocked at @bobsaget's passing.' 'One of the most kind & thoughtful people I've ever come across & he just happened to be one of the funniest on the planet,' he continued. 'I will miss you so much Bob. Love you dear friend. I'm so sorry @kellyrizzo. And so sorry to the rest of the family.' Howie Mandel posted a playful photo featuring his old friend and wrote, 'Comedy and tragedy are so close together and today they collided.' Comedian Dane cook wrote that he was 'stunned beyond belief' at Saget's death. 'I'm confused and sad here...

The Masked Singer panelist Ken Jeong was in 'shock' and 'so numb right now.' Russell Crowe applauded Saget as 'a good hang' and 'a good chat,' adding that he was 'kind, funny, generous.'

Comedian Jim Norton bemoaned how 'Everything I start to write about him just feels inadequate.' 'He is universally loved. I am so grateful he was my friend.' Community's Yvette Nicole Brown wrote that she had recently worked with Saget and bemoaned what seemed like a string of deaths of beloved stars. 'He was such a lovely, funny man,' she wrote. 'What is going on?!' Tom Green said he was 'extremely saddened' to hear of Saget's death. 'You were always hilarious and kind. You made my life and so many other peoples lives better Bob. Rest In Peace.' Pauly Shore recounted how he first met Saget at The Comedy Store 'when I was just a kid in the 1970s.' Jane Lynch urged her followers to check out Saget's acclaimed (and raunchy) 'impromptu The Aristocrats story on YouTube. It's brilliant and not for the faint of heart.' Tom Arnold joked that 'The only people who said terrible things about Bob Saget were his best friends [broken-hearted emoji].' 'I f***ing loved that dude,' gushed comedian Brian Posehn. 'I'll never see him in an airport and talk s*** about Stamos again. What a kick in the gut,' he wrote. 'My heart breaks for @JohnStamos and @DaveCoulier, so sorry fellas,' he added. Artie Lange, who costarred in Dirty Work, wrote that 'Bob was so special to me and I'll be sad about this day forever.' 'Please be kind like Bob always was and considering donating here. It would mean everything to him,' he wrote, linking to a page for the National Scleroderma Foundation. Saget's sister died from the disease in 1994, according to his website.

Country singer Mickey Guyton was 'completely heartbroken' over the news. Patton Oswalt revealed that he had Saget over to his house in October to interview him for a documentary. 'We were going to catch up over coffee when he was done editing and now I'm crying F***,' he wrote. Comedian Marc Maron called the America's Funniest Home Videos host 'truly one of the nicest guys and so funny.' Zelda Williams, daughter of the late Robin Williams, urged Saget's devastated fans to 'please try to be mindful of the mourning, and privacy, of his loved ones.' 'Don't bombard them if they have socials. Don't consume clickbait media that may have invaded their privacy or violated their safety. They're human.' Kathy Griffin seconded B.J. Novak's love for Saget in her own tweet. 'You couldn't find a nicer or sharper wit than Bog Saget. Shocked and devastated.' Comedian Nikki Glaser added that he was 'as kind as he was funny.'

'I'm glad to have called you friend, brother and supporter. Heaven just got a little more sweet and funnier RIP to my homie forever bro,' he added. The illusionist David Copperfield called Saget 'Such a Wonderful Talented Person' and added, 'we will miss you.' Songwriter Diane Warren could barely handle the news. 'What sad s***** beyond f***ed up news about Bob Saget. F***,' she cursed. Larry the Cable Guy admitted he only met Saget once when he dropped by an Orlando comedy club to workshop new material, but the two 'had such a blast that night and shared tons of laughs.' Filmmaker and comedian Judd Apatow joined others in celebrating the stand-up comic's kindness. 'Bob Saget was so kind and when you spent time with him he made you laugh hard,' he tweeted. 'He loved to be funny and he was hysterical. He was also there for everyone. A beautiful soul.' Neal Brennan, who co-wrote Half Baked with Dave Chappelle, tried to find some humor that Saget might have approved of in his tribute.

The comedian George Wallace wrote that he had 'four decades of friendship' with Saget and noted that they spend a Thanksgiving together early in their careers.

829,1,DGAP-Adhoc: âââââââSÃ¼dzucker expects significant earnings increase in the first quarter of the current 2022/23 financial year,724 words,DGAP Regulatory News,"14-Apr-2022 / 14:05 CET/CEST Disclosure of an inside information acc. to Article 17 MAR of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, transmitted by DGAP - a service of EQS Group AG. The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. Positive initial outlook for full fiscal 2022/23 despite Ukraine war After a very positive start to fiscal 2022/23, SÃ¼dzucker AG expects EBITDA and operating result for the first quarter of fiscal 2022/23 (1 March to 31 May 2022) to be significantly higher than last year's levels (Q1 2021/22: EBITDA: EUR 121 million; operating result: EUR 49 million). For fiscal 2022/23 as a whole, SÃ¼dzucker expects group revenues of EUR 8.7 to 9.1 (2021/22 year: 7.6) billion. We see EBITDA in a range of EUR 660 to 760 (2021/22: 692) million and consolidated operating result in a range of EUR 300 to 400 (2021/22: 332) million. The war in Ukraine, which has been ongoing since the beginning of the 2022/23 financial year, has further intensified the already high volatility on the sales markets and price increases on the procurement markets. The resulting economic and financial impact and the duration of this temporary exceptional situation, in addition to the Corona pandemic, are difficult to assess. In addition, the risks associated with the Corona pandemic continue to exist. The forecast for the first quarter and the full year is based on the assumption that the Ukraine war will remain temporary and regionally limited, that the physical supply of energy and raw materials is guaranteed and that the sales and procurement markets will partially normalize during fiscal 2022/23. In this context, SÃ¼dzucker's expected transfer of the significantly higher prices, especially in the raw material and energy sectors, into new customer contracts will be of decisive importance. The annual report for fiscal 2021/22 - including detailed forecast for fiscal 2022/23 - will be published on 19 May 2022, and the quarterly report for the first quarter of fiscal 2022/23 on 7 July 2022.

738,0,Okta Under Fire Over Handling of Security Incident; The identity-protection company acknowledged the breach two months after spotting suspicious activity,934 words,WSJ Pro Cybersecurity,"Several customers have publicly chastised Okta for a slow drip of information that left them uncertain about what to do. The fallout highlights how communication is key in response to breaches, cyber experts say, particularly as security teams race to contain hackers who use technology suppliers as springboards for wide-ranging attacks. ""This, going forward, will be a case study in mismanaging a third-party breach,"" said Jake Williams, a security analyst with IANS Research, a consulting firm. ""You control the narrative, not your customers, not your vendors, not threat actors."" The aftermath of a cybersecurity incident can challenge even the most prepared firms, said Meredith Griffanti, co-head of the cybersecurity and data privacy communications practice at business advisory firm FTI Consulting Inc . While lawyers, security staff, forensic investigators, crisis-communications specialists and others may all be scrambling to obtain and convey information, it's crucial that it is done so in a controlled manner, she said. ""There are a lot of cooks in the kitchen, and it's super important that everyone is consistent and knows what the story is before they go out and start making definitive statements,"" said Ms. Griffanti, who managed communications for credit bureau Equifax Inc . during its 2017 data breach. In the Okta case, the hackers themselves are adding to the confusion, leaving some customers under the impression that Okta is reacting to its alleged attackers rather than communicating proactively. Lapsus$'s initial claim of a breach came with a warning for Okta 's clients. The group said on Telegram that ""our focus was ONLY on okta customers"" as opposed to Okta itself. A relatively new criminal extortion group, Lapsus$ has been tied to recent attacks on tech giant Microsoft Corp . and chipmaker Nvidia Corp . On Tuesday morning, Okta Chief Executive Todd McKinnon said on Twitter that the company believed screenshots posted alongside the message from Lapsus$ were connected to suspicious activity Okta had seen in January but didn't disclose. ""The Okta service has not been breached and remains fully operational,"" Chief Security Officer David Bradbury said in a blog post Tuesday morning. ""There are no corrective actions that need to be taken by our customers."" But Lapsus$ continued trolling Okta on its Telegram channel, which has 45,000 subscribers, claiming that the firm was downplaying the potential impacts on its customers. Okta responded later Tuesday with a more detailed blog post by Mr. Bradbury, who offered a timeline of the company's response in the hope ""that it will illuminate why I am confident in our conclusions."" Mr. Bradbury said Okta 's security team on Jan. 20 noticed unusual behavior on the account of a customer-support engineer employed by a vendor, Sykes, which is a division of Miami-based call-center company Sitel Group . Okta reported the apparent incident to Sitel the next day and Sitel contracted an outside forensics firm that investigated the incident through Feb. 28, Mr. Bradbury said.  Okta received a summary of the report on March 17, four days before Lapsus$ posted screenshots on Telegram. Sitel provided the full version of the report on Tuesday, Mr. Bradbury said in the blog post. ""I am greatly disappointed by the long period of time that transpired between our notification to Sitel and the issuance of the complete investigation report,"" he said. A spokesman for Sitel Group confirmed a January security breach on ""parts of the Sykes network"" but declined to comment further. Okta didn't respond to a request for additional comment. Some customers haven't hidden their displeasure. The cloud-infrastructure and security provider Cloudflare Inc . publicly mulled dumping Okta as a vendor and published its own blog post [https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-investigation-of-the-january-2022-okta-compromise] with tips on how security teams should hunt for threats. Amit Yoran , chief executive of security firm Tenable Inc., wrote in a LinkedIn post Wednesday that the breach should have been disclosed [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-letter-okta-amit-yoran/?trackingId=Tav6voDJc5OTK1scRwg7sg==] either in January or after a timely forensic analysis. ""As a customer, all we can say is that Okta has not contacted us,"" Mr. Yoran said. Theresa Payton, chief executive of cyber consultancy Fortalice Solutions, said she is advising her customers to assume a breach, review their logs to check for failed login attempts and ensure that multifactor authentication is working properly. ""They can still turn this around,"" Ms. Payton said about Okta . ""But it's going to require transparency in their communications."" In a Wednesday morning webinar with customers, Okta 's Mr. Bradbury said the company should have moved faster after receiving the initial report about the incident on March 17, adding that he expects some questions will remain unanswered. The event lasted about 10 minutes. Mr. Bradbury took no questions.

149,0,"Sanctions, not ethics, spur corporate flight from Russia",860 words,The Australian Financial Review,"Perhaps Putin has inadvertently achieved what thousands of earnest environmental, social and governance investment codes could not, and prompted companies to bring binding ethical judgments into their supply chain decisions. Sadly, that's a bit far-fetched. Looking at their operations in Russia and elsewhere, most multinationals seem far more driven directly or indirectly by official sanctions than by sudden fits of corporate conscience. The appearance of voluntary action may arise because it's not straightforward to map across specific European and US sanctions (for example, on banks and individuals) to companies ceasing Russian operations. Few Hollywood studios, car producers, furniture stores, or consumer goods manufacturers have been directly forbidden from dealing with Russia, unlike exporters of semiconductors and sensitive tech. But it doesn't seem likely that the precision-made accuracy of US and European sanctions on Russia has made such an impact. Instead, it's created an environment of such legal and financial hostility that risk-averse companies are staying clear. Being cancelled by indignant consumers is an important issue - that's probably what's driving the McDonald's and Coca-Cola decisions - but many corporates have more fundamental concerns. Will they unknowingly end up doing business with a sanctioned individual? Will they get prosecuted? Will they get paid? They might still earn profits in Russia, but can they get them out? The European sanctions on Russia are extraordinarily tough by historical standards, but the US remains by far the biggest player because of Washington's control of the dollar payments system, including the Swift messaging facility and the long reach of correspondent banking. Compliance becomes so complicated that even if an activity or an entity isn't specifically sanctioned, any company wanting to retain access to the US banking and payments system needs a strong profit incentive to bother picking its way through the legal thicket. This is evident from Iran, where the US's use of secondary sanctions - which threaten disconnection from the dollar payments system for companies doing business with banned entities - has deterred Europeans from transacting there. The EU , whose governments have a far less confrontational approach to relations with Tehran, has attempted legally to protect its companies via the so-called ""blocking statute"", which prohibits them from complying with extraterritorial foreign sanctions that the EU regards as illegal under international law. The EU set up a quasi-barter system called Instex which enables them to transact with Iran outside the dollar system. Yet European companies keep business transactions with Iran minimal, for fear of being cut off from US banking. The idea that US and European companies are independently developing a moral aversion to human rights abuses withers when confronted with their continued activities in autocracies such as China and Saudi Arabia. Those governments aren't Putin's Russia, but they do some pretty vile things, notably Saudi's indiscriminate bombing of Yemeni civilians and China incarcerating a million Uyghurs in Xinjiang province. Both countries are generally unpopular with the American and European public and yet multinationals maintain strong links there. In the UK, Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich has decided to sell Chelsea FC, but a consortium led by Saudi's sovereign wealth fund owns Newcastle United. Volkswagen has stopped producing in and exporting to Russia and wrung its hands piteously over violations of international law, but it's still happily building cars in Xinjiang. McDonald's opened two restaurants in Xinjiang last year. The salient difference with Russia is that US and European governments aren't targeting Saudi and China with sanctions and turning public opinion further against them. Indeed, Joe Biden is reportedly asking Saudi Arabia to replace Russian oil. In Germany, a ""due diligence"" law making companies responsible for abuses in their supply chains - which would have focused attention on their Chinese operations - was watered down after pressure from German industry. The contrasting behaviour of rich world companies in different autocracies underlines that embargoes and boycotts don't generally just happen. Sanctions work when determined governments, particularly the US, weave dense webs of restrictions that warn companies to stay clear and lead public opinion towards the same conclusion. Jumping from Russia before you are pushed is self-interest: it is not an act of principle."

In fact, this campaign has similarities with one from 2020 where LightSpy iOS malware was distributed the same way. * The payload ï¿½?DazzleSpy ï¿½?is capable of a wide variety of cyberespionage actions. * ESET Research can conclude that the group behind this operation has strong technical capabilities. * The malware uses China Standard Time and contains a number of internal messages in Chinese. BRATISLAVA, MONTREAL ï¿½?ESET researchers have discovered that the news website of Hong Kong pro-democracy radio station D100 was recently compromised to serve a Safari exploit that installed cyberespionage malware on site visitorsï¿½?Macs. The watering-hole operations the attackers have pursued show that the targets are likely to be politically active, pro-democracy individuals in Hong Kong. The malware delivered to vulnerable visitors of the site was new macOS malware ESET has named DazzleSpy. The malicious code is capable of collecting a wide variety of sensitive and personal information. The first report about the watering-hole attacks leading to exploits for the Safari web browser running on macOS was published by Google last November. ESET researchers were investigating the attacks at the same time as Google and have uncovered additional details about both the targets and malware used to compromise the victims. ESET has confirmed that the patch identified by the Google team fixes the Safari vulnerability used in the attacks. âThe exploit used to gain code execution in the browser is quite complex and had more than 1,000 lines of code. Itâs interesting to note that some code suggests the vulnerability could also have been exploited on iOS, even on devices such as the iPhone XS and newer,ï¿½?says Marc-Ãtienne LÃ©veillÃ©, who investigated the watering-hole attack. This campaign has similarities with one from 2020 where LightSpy iOS malware was distributed the same way, using iframe injection on websites for Hong Kong citizens leading to a WebKit exploit. The payload ï¿½?DazzleSpy ï¿½?is capable of a wide variety of cyberespionage actions. It can collect information about the compromised computer; search for specified files; scan files in Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders; execute the supplied shell commands; start or end a remote screen session; and write a supplied file to disk. Given the complexity of the exploits used in this campaign, ESET Research can conclude that the group behind this operation has strong technical capabilities. Itâs also interesting that end-to-end encryption is enforced in DazzleSpy meaning it wonât communicate with its command and control (C&C) server if anyone tries to eavesdrop on the unencrypted transmission. Among other interesting findings about this threat actor is that once the malware obtains the current date and time on a compromised computer, it converts the obtained date to the Asia/Shanghai time zone (aka China Standard Time), before sending it to the C&C server. In addition, the DazzleSpy malware contains a number of internal messages in Chinese.

332,1,"GWM Invests CNY 9 billion on R&D, Focusing on New Energy and Intelligentization",539 words,Canada NewsWire,"Lv Wenbin, General Manager of Technology of GWM HAVAL, said that facing competition in the global market, GWM has always insisted on the concept of ""excessive investment and precise R&D"" to fulfill the diversified personalized needs of global users. Over the past years, GWM has continued to carry out precise investments in both new energy and intelligent sectors and keep launching various advanced technologies to the markets. In the new energy sector, GWM officially unveiled the L.E.M.O.N. DHT. As a highly integrated and high-efficient hybrid system, this technology is compatible with and can be equipped in both HEV and PHEV power architectures. Among them, the overall powertrain efficiency of models equipped with HEV power architectures can be improved by more than 50%. In the on-site testing, the fuel-saving rate of these models can achieve 35% to 50% compared to other fuel models. Take HAVAL JOLION HEV as an example. Supported by the L.E.M.O.N. DHT, its fuel consumption can be automatically adjusted to maximize fuel efficiency in different driving modes such as standard, sports and ECO. This function can meet users' needs in various scenarios, including urban roads, express ways and other driving conditions. In the intelligence sector, GWM launched Coffee Intelligence 2.0 and grandly unveiled a new electronic and electrical architecture and intelligent drive-by-wire chassis last year. Based on all these technological improvements, the development of Coffee Intelligence 2.0 also focuses on upgrading the intelligent driving technology and developed the NOH (Navigation On HIPilot) intelligence-assisted driving navigation system. When the system turns on, the vehicle can automatically assist the driver in lane changing, overtaking and other actions in the driving process. It can also monitor whether the driver is fatigued, unable to concentrate or in other conditions, reflecting the user-oriented design of the system. Science and technology make it possible for more users to enjoy a more comfortable driving experience. On the 8th Technology Festival held by the company, GWM announced that it would continue to expand the global research and development staff to 30,000 and the total investment in the next five years would reach CNY 100 billion. In addition to the research and development sector, GWM is also actively building a low-carbon auto industrial chain connecting the whole world. It has proposed to build its first zero-carbon factory by 2023 to provide a more intelligent, safer and more environmentally friendly driving experience for global users.

123,0,GALLERIA IS SOLD TO LOCAL INVESTORS // The mallâs Houston-based owner had tried to sell it just before the pandemic but then put its plans on hold,698 words,Star-Tribune,"JLL said the Galleria is 99% leased, making it an outlier among regional malls that have struggled to attract and retain tenants through the pandemic and an uncertain future for retail. The Galleria has experienced strong leasing momentum since the first quarter of 2020, signing deals that account for more than 170,000 square feet of space, JLL said. âGalleria Edina is one of the premier retail assets in the Midwest and has an expansive trade area as a result of being the sole location for many of the tenants in the Midwest region,ï¿½?said Danny Finkle, a co-head of JLLâs U.S. retail business, in a statement. âThis is the essence of a generational asset within a remarkable market with unlimited growth opportunities ahead.ï¿½?A representative for Hines said that the company will continue to manage the mall for its new owners. Dick Grones of Twin Cities-based Cambridge Commercial Realty said that given the mallâs high occupancy and top-shelf tenants, heâs not surprised the mall found a buyer when so many others havenât. Upscale retailers, he said, have few options if they want a location in the Twin Cities. âItâs a whoâs-who of [retail] names when you walk through that mall,ï¿½?he said. âItâs a mall thatâs out there on its own.ï¿½?For shoppers, itâs the exclusivity of its tenants that sets the Galleria apart, Grones said, noting that while retail and other commercial sectors have suffered through the pandemic, many high-end shopping destinations including the Galleria have fared better than others. âHigh-end retail has suffered but not as much as the midrange retailers,ï¿½?he said. âWealthy people have just gotten wealthy.ï¿½?The pandemic aside, brick-and-mortar retailers in the Twin Cities have been forced to evolve over the years. That includes the Galleria, which was once dominated by high-end furniture stores including Crate & Barrel, Design Within Reach and Gabberts, which vacated the mall in 2020. Today, the Galleria is dominated by high-end specialty retailers that canât be found anywhere else in the region, including Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co. âYou can still get the biggest diamonds and the nicest meals at the Galleria,ï¿½?Grones said. âTheyâve done a good job of setting themselves apart from general retail.ï¿½?As retailers move online and filling retail space gets more difficult, the Galleria and other malls have also explored other ways to increase their revenue and the value of their property. That includes selling outlots for restaurants and converting parking lots into apartments and for-sale condominiums that create a kind of town center experience. A Westin hotel and high-end condos have been built at the Galleria. The former space for Gabbertâs, the retailer that started the mall in 1974 and left in 2019, may someday become the site for housing or another hotel. âGabberts left a big physical space behind,ï¿½?said Grones. âMalls are exploring all kinds of different alternatives.ï¿½?Jim Buchta ï¿½?612-673-7376 SEE MICROFILM OR PDF FOR MAP."

Thirty-four people have already pledged to purchase at least one $5000 share within the first weeks of the proposal, equalling a massive $240,000 of the total $500,000 target. It is proposed the total investment would be put into a company or unit trust that would then hire hotel management and staff. Long-term Yangan resident Margaret Bateman said the initiative was inspired by the efforts of the Grong Grong community in southern NSW to save their beloved pub, with the tiny town raising $1m to prevent its closure last month. Ms Bateman said she and many others involved had strong connections to the Yangan and Swanfels area dating back to the 19th century, including when her own great-uncle was publican of the Yangan Hotel. âItâs a focal point, a community place. Itâs more than just somewhere to have a beer,ï¿½?she said. âPeople around here are very willing to support new management, because they want this place to work. The thing about having a lot of people involved is we all have our own networks to help get the word out.ï¿½?For former Yangan resident Julie Willmann and husband David, the project is a chance to return to their roots and give back to a place special to them. âItâs bringing back life to a country town that weâve had connections to in younger life,ï¿½?Mrs Willmann said. The eager group already have big ideas to turn the Yangan Hotel into a drawcard for visitors from right across the region and wider South East Queensland, with themed pub nights and events, but agreed the key to success would be nailing the basics such as a country meal and great service. With another $260,000 to be attracted before the community can turn their dream into a reality, potential shareholder Don Drane said anyone with means should consider it a worthy investment to see the Yangan institution alive once more. âThe main thing is weâve got to attract people ï¿½?and if itâs good, people will come,ï¿½?he said."
179,1,Argentina - Energy Supply - Gas,487 words,Global Energy Research,"The country has imported gas (by pipe from Bolivia) and LNG since 2009. Imports increased rapidly to a peak of 12 bcm in 2014; they have been decreasing since 2017 (7 bcm in 2020). LNG accounted for almost 25% of gas imports in 2020. In 2020, LNG mainly came from Qatar (48%), the USA (23%), and Trinidad & Tobago (19%). The relationship between Argentina and Chile has been tense since 2004, when Argentina significantly reduced its natural gas exports to Chile (from 6 bcm in 2006 to 2.4 bcm in 2007). Argentina stopped exports in 2016 and 2017 and, in 2018, the Government agreed to restart exports to Chile (expected to reach 11Â bcm/year by 2022). Argentina and Chile are connected by four gas pipelines: GasAndes (3.2Â mcm/d) majority-owned by Total; Gasoducto del PacÃ­fico (capacity of 3.8Â mcm/d), owned by a consortium set up by Total and made up of El Paso, Gasco, Enap and YPF; GasAtacama (8.2 mcm/d), and NorAndino (7.7Â mcm/d), which are parallel pipes that belong to CMS and Endesa, and to Tractebel and Southern Company, respectively. The 70 km-long Gasoducto de Integracion Juana Azurduy (GIJA) pipeline, an interconnector between the Bolivian gas fields (Margarita) and the GNEA in Argentina, was completed in 2011. An 800 km-long gas pipeline with a capacity of 1 mcm/d connecting Comodoro Rivadavia in the province of Chubut and Esquel (south of the country) was commissioned in 2006. The capacity of the San Martin gas pipeline in Tierra del Fuego, managed by TGS, was increased in 2011 (from 5.4 mcm/d to 7.4 mcm/d). In 2014, YPF commissioned a new pipeline with a capacity of 5Â mcm/d (1.8Â bcm/year) to deliver natural gas from the Rincon de Mangrullo field to the Loma la Plata gas refinery, in the Neuquen region. It enabled gas production at the Rincon de Mangrullo field to increase to 365Â mcm/year. Argentina has two LNG regasification terminals: Escobar LNG, commissioned by Enarsa and Repsol in 2011 on the ParanÃ¡ River close to Buenos Aires (8.2Â bcm/year), and FSRU Excelerate Exemplar, recommissioned by YPF in Bahia Blanca port in June 2021 (2.2 bcm/year), after it was stopped in 2018. A floating liquefaction unit (FLNG), Tango LNG, was commissioned by Exmar in 2019 with a capacity of 0.68 bcm/year, turning Argentina into an LNG exporter; it will be used by YPF to export gas from Vaca Muerta.

497,0,The Inspector calls at the 'perfectly placed' Kimpton Charlotte Square hotel in Edinburgh... and vows to return,483 words,Mail Online,"* A big selling point is the large spa in the basement, with a heated pool, gym and treatment rooms, he says Nothing quite compares with Edinburgh on a bright and frosty morning. And when staying at the Kimpton in the Georgian masterpiece that is Charlotte Square, youâre in the perfect position to admire its wonders. Prince Albert sits on a bronze horse in the middle of the square (are his days numbered?); next door is Rose Street, the famous pedestrianised road lined with pubs, and walk 100 yards down to Princes Street and the mighty castle looms above you. A couple of bicycles stand in the lobby of the hotel along with just enough tartan to get the Scottish message across without overdoing it. The reception area is the grandest part of what is seven interconnected, narrow townhouses. From here, double doors lead to The Garden, an area covered in glass, which doesnât quite feel like a garden, but there are plenty of places to sit and ponder ï¿½?and breakfast is served here.

The environments they've been to will be disinfected. Those who test positive for the COVID-19 will be transferred to quarantine sites as needed,"" said Jiang. ""We'll also help people in need secure jobs in the city. For people not included in the situations above, local governments will provide them with daily necessities and house them in temporary relocation sites,"" she added. Shanghai, with the majority of its neighborhoods still under lockdown, reported 23,072 new locally transmitted infections on Thursday, 3,200 of which are symptomatic cases. Vice-Premier Sun Chunlan said on Friday that Shanghai is expected to cut off COVID-19 transmission in communities very soon after nearly 50,000 medical workers have come to Shanghai's aid. According to Peng Chenlei, the city's vice-mayor, the city had received 337 million yuan ($52.9 million) in donations from the society as of April 11, with 316 million yuan already utilized. Among the donors is Shanghai Charity Foundation, which gave 116 million yuan, 86 million yuan of which has been spent on supplies for prevention and control. ""The city government will further support and motivate charities and nongovernmental public welfare organizations to carry out fundraising,"" Peng said. The municipal government has also bolstered management, improved environmental disinfection and increased vaccination rates at local nursing homes to minimize senior citizens' exposure risk. Visits at nursing homes have been suspended since March 1 and these facilities have also been operating under closed-loop management since March 10. No private exchanges of goods between people at nursing homes and those outside are allowed. Package deliveries must go through disinfection as well, Peng said. Staff members from nursing homes are required to take nucleic acid tests every two days and the elderly living there twice a week, he said. The seniors are encouraged to get vaccinated if their health conditions allow for it. Unvaccinated staff members will not be allowed to work on front lines. ""To relieve their loneliness and anxiety, activities are regularly held at nursing homes. The staff also facilitate video calls with family members. Videos documenting life in the nursing homes are also sent to their relatives as well,"" Peng added. caochen@chinadaily.com.cn"

944,0,German court to rule in row over funding for cruise shipbuilder MV Werften,320 words,Reuters News,"Genting's subsidiary Genting Hong Kong said on Tuesday the German government and the German federal state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern had withheld a total $336 million in funding it was promised. Included in that was an $88 million backstop facility from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern that the Hong Kong group said it was due to draw down, but said that the German state imposed additional pre-conditions in December. The German government has said Genting Hong Kong had turned down aid that was offered to it. Genting's court case was heard by the regional court in the northern German town of Schwerin on Tuesday. A spokesman for the court said a ruling would be made on Monday at 2 p.m. local time (1300 GMT).  Genting Hong Kong also said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Tuesday that MV's insolvency led to defaults under its ""Global 1"" credit facility, which would in turn lead to further defaults on financing arrangements worth a total of around $2.8 billion. Shares in Genting Hong Kong have been suspended from trade since Friday. The company said they would continue to be suspended pending another announcement, which would include the outcome of legal proceedings.

633,0,"Google, Meta face penalties in Russia as deadline passes to open local offices",588 words,Reuters News,"In November, state communications regulator Roskomnadzor listed 13 companies it wanted to set up officially on Russian soil and last month said it would start imposing restrictions by the end of February. Ahead of Monday's deadline, only a few had complied. Russia's invasion of Ukraine last week has added to pressure on Western businesses to push back on Putin in any way possible. The new rules also require companies to register with Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor and have a system for fielding user complaints.  Apple Inc and Spotify Technology SA had fully complied before fighting began in Ukraine, and Roskomnadzor's website on Monday also showed Rakuten Group Inc's messaging app Viber had completed all required steps. Six other companies had fulfilled at least one policy but had not established a Russian legal entity or local office. Those were Google, Meta, Twitter Inc, ByteDance's TikTok, Zoom Video Communications Inc, JOYY Inc's video app Likee, the government website https://236-fz.rkn.gov.ru/agents/list[https://236-fz.rkn.gov.ru/agents/list] showed late Monday. Four companies - chat tool Discord, Amazon.com Inc's live streaming unit Twitch, messaging app Telegram and bookmarking service Pinterest Inc - had taken no steps to comply, according to the website. Likee said its Feb. 16 filing to form a Russian legal entity is under review and that it plans to comply with the law. Twitter declined to comment while the other 11 companies did not respond to requests for comment. Last month, Roskomnadzor said it would begin barring non-compliant companies from selling ads in Russia. It previously has said blocking access to the targeted services would be a last resort, and that other penalties could include limiting data collection and money transfers. The regulation is a part of a wider campaign for internet control that critics say threatens individual and corporate freedom. Authorities in Russia have issued small fines to social media companies in the last year for ignoring their demands to censor anti-government activists or information. Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation,"" has curtailed access to Facebook in recent days in retaliation for censoring state media services, which critics say promote fake news and propaganda. Twitter has also been slow to access on mobile devices. Demand for virtual private networking (VPN) apps, which can help with circumventing internet restrictions, has surged in Russia amid the latest crackdown. Three of the top five most downloaded apps on Apple's App Store on Monday were VPNs, and they generated a combined 383,000 installs over the past seven days, 15 times more than the prior seven-day period, according to estimates from tracker Sensor Tower. Russia, which has a population of about 144 million, had nearly 51 million users on Instagram and 7.5 million on Facebook as of last November, according to research outfit Insider Intelligence.

295,1,National Grid cashes in as electricity prices surge,333 words,Scottish Daily Mail,"The announcement comes as inflation reached a 30-year-high of 7pc, with growing energy prices playing a big role in the increase. Power prices in the UK have surged in the past year, driven by an increase in the cost of natural gas. Oil and gas prices have jumped 37pc and 90pc respectively since the start of the year, leading to a Â£693 rise in the energy price cap in April. The cap is expected to rise again in October if global power prices remain elevated. There have been calls for the company to use its increased profits to reduce bills for households. Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said: 'Households up and down the country will look on in horror at the spectre of a private firm profiteering from the misery of increasing fuel prices. 'This is obscene, and we would urge the directors of National Grid to spend the Easter weekend talking to people who are struggling to make ends meet and look at how they may use their profits for good. The announcement just goes to show why so many people across the political spectrum are now calling for windfall taxes.'  National Grid makes its money by charging suppliers to use its network to provide electricity to households, a cost that is then passed on to consumers through a transmission charge added to their bills.  Wera Hobhouse MP, the Liberal Democrat spokesman for energy, said: 'People can't afford to heat and power their homes right now yet they are watching major suppliers rake in billions. The call for windfall taxes on energy suppliers is deafening yet the Government is burying their heads in the sand.'"
690,0,"Morrison, News Corp use Haighâs piece in GT as a tool to seek ugly political gains",829 words,Global Times,"Morrison's approval rating reportedly fell to its lowest in nearly two years in January. And the new poll conducted between February 9 and 12 shows that he still trails Labor leader Anthony Albanese, Bloomberg reported. In a desperate attempt to reverse the downward drift, he and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp are exploiting all means to start a scare and smear campaign on China, bizarrely linking their ""China threat theory"" with the opposition party. Global Times on Monday published an opinion piece written by former Australian diplomat Bruce Haigh, entitled ""Weak Australian leadership inhibits potential relationship reset with China."" It said Albanese ""is not a lateral thinker, he is not creative, he will not be a charismatic leaderâ¦Albanese looks increasingly likely to win the election, not because of anything he has done but because Morrison's LNP is imploding, through corruption, failure to manage COVID-19 and a range of other anti-social programs and prejudices."" This op-ed has been lashed at by some Australian politicians and Murdoch's media outlets as the ""smoking gun"" that GT and Beijing are ""interfering"" in Australian politics. Sky News said GT ""backs Anthony Albanese as Prime Minister as questions mount over Labor's ties with Beijing."" According to news.com.au, referring to Deputy Labor leader Richard Marles and Albanese as a ""Manchurian candidate"" - an absurd remark that he was forced to subsequently withdraw - Morrison said ""The Chinese Government has picked their horse and he's sitting right there,'' a ludicrous allusion directed at the Labor leader. Anyone with basic common sense knows that opinion pieces by external authors and columnists do not represent the position of the newspaper itself. This is the practice of most media in the world. GT also reminds readers with the disclaimer that ""opinions expressed are those of the writers alone and do not necessarily reflect the position of The Global Times."" Newspapers are forums for a diversity of opinions, reflecting a spectrum of views and stances. How could an article by a former Australian career diplomat reflect the Chinese government's policy? As an Australian citizen and keen observer of Australian politics, Haigh has every right to speak out his understanding and outlook in a media outlet of his choice. His recent GT piece reflects part of Australian public opinion on the ""abysmal state"" of the political reality in Canberra. Acting as one of the most enthusiastic vanguards in Washington's anti-China campaign, the Morrison administration has been fanning an anti-China frenzy, which has become even more enflamed during the election season. The Morrison government is now brainwashing the Australian public by inciting fear and panic with shameless lies about China. The slightest opportunity for their myopic political benefits has been taken advantage of and magnified in distortion. Such acts are despicable and pathetic. Branded ""a liar"" and ""a hypocrite"" by political leaders from Australia and internationally, Morrison is no longer capable of decent political performance in an open and honest manner. With the ever lurking challenges from his most formidable internecine rival Peter Dutton, a far-right anti-China politician, Morrison has been frantically trying to act tough and rough by imprudently manipulating Australia's foreign policy to survive in Canberra's brutal ""game of thrones."" The ""anti-China card"" is Morrison's last resort to help salvage public opinion. Further impairment to Australia's relationship with China won't gain political benefits for him, only revealing his political immaturity and lack of political wisdom. Bilateral relations between China and Australia have been undergoing an ever lower downward spiral since mid-2017. The previously mutually beneficial political, economic, social and cultural exchanges and cooperation have been spoiled and ravaged to the dismay and disappointment of the wider community in Australia. Canberra's politicians obviously need more political wisdom and sensibility, not further political power games, which would only wreak more havoc to the relations of China and Australia.

468,1,Lifeguards to return to Parry Sound's Waubuno Beach this summer if staff can be recruited,468 words,Parry Sound North Star,"With the cost of lifeguards back in the budget, the tax rate would increase back to 2.95 per cent which was the initial amount first proposed to council. ""I think right across the board we've experienced it in the last couple years whether it's COVID related or some sort of shift, student employment has been difficult in general to fill,"" said director of public works Mike Kearns. It is not just the town of Parry Sound but perhaps in the aquatics industry as a whole, said Kearns. Parks and recreation manager April McNamara said the positions are ""very difficult to fill and the pandemic has not helped."" McNamara explained the Lifesaving Society, which holds all the training programs, has been on somewhat of a hiatus and the ones that remained operational has special exception. ""They're not seeing a lot of certified staff turned into the program,"" said McNamara. Student volunteers have shadowed lifeguards at the beach through a leadership program in the past. However, in most instances due to this hiatus, individuals lack certain certifications to be qualified. McNamara highlighted that staff will be ""stretched"" in order to have this implemented. Typically, they would have all the lifeguard positions filled at this time, she said. The positions have been listed since January and only one is reported to be filled. Kearns added that this staffing issue could extend to the operation of the swim program as well. If both the swim and lifeguard programs run, McNamara said staff are not confident they are going to be able to acquire qualified staff to run safe programs. Mayor Jamie McGarvey directed staff to investigate the opportunity of creating a shared swim program with neighbouring municipalities given the challenges in securing swim instructors. It was also established that a deadline of mid to late May would need to be set to know whether there is qualified staff to run the program or if the funds return to reserves.

418,1,China's stock market offers growing support to the real economy: PHBS Think Tank report,381 words,PR Newswire Europe,"In addition, the newly-established Beijing Stock Exchange (BSE) marks a key step in China's efforts to deepen capital market reform, according to the report. Of the first batch of 81 companies listed on the newly-established (BSE), 78 % are SMEs in advanced manufacturing, modern services, high-tech services and strategic industries. Based on this, the report suggests that the BSE is playing a significant role in stimulating the direct financing of SMEs in the National Equities Exchange and Quotations, further enhancing the financing capability of China's multi-level capital market. However, due to mixed pressure from refinancing, financial fraud, ineffective regulation, and irrational speculators, China's stock market is still dealing with multiple challenges to attract medium and long-term funds, according to the Think Tank. Researchers suggest that an effective issuance system, a transaction system, and a transparent regulation need to be implemented. For instance, the efficiency of the registration-based IPO system requires highly transparent information disclosure and proactive financing regulation. Effective policies to attract long-term capital and improve risk management are needed to curb the irrational speculation of both individual and institutional investors and ensure sustainable development of the equity market."
39,0,"D.C. sues Grubhub, alleging it took advantage of suffering restaurants",1442 words,Washington Post.com,"Fox declined to enroll Bub and Pop's in the program. The Supper for Support initiative is history, but in a lawsuit filed this week, D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine listed the program as one of eight deceptive practices that Grubhub has allegedly employed while delivering food during the pandemic. In the District alone, the lawsuit claims, diners redeemed more than 10,000 Supper for Support discounts, translating into ""tens of thousands of dollars in additional revenue"" for Grubhub. In the complaint, Racine also alleges that Grubhub listed more than 1,000 restaurants on its platforms without a contract with those businesses. What's more, he claims that Grubhub obscured some of its fees and that the company often charged more for items that could be purchased cheaper at the restaurant, without disclosing such information to consumers.  Grubhub ""took advantage of local restaurants to boost its own profits, even as District consumers and small businesses struggled,"" Racine said in a news release. ""Grubhub charged hidden fees and used bait-and-switch advertising tactics ï¿½?which are illegal,"" the attorney general added. ""On top of that, the company deceived users with a promotion that claimed to support local restaurants during the heart of the pandemic. But in reality, this program cut into struggling restaurants' profit margins while padding Grubhub's bottom line."" In a statement to The Washington Post, Grubhub spokeswoman Liza Dee said the company had already abandoned a number of the practices mentioned in the lawsuit, including the Supper for Support program, and that the company would update its platforms to make sure its fees are clear on the checkout page while letting customers know that ""prices may be lower in store."" Dee said all of Grubhub's fees are laid out in the terms of use, to which every diner must agree before using the service. But Dee also said that Grubhub would aggressively defend its business in court. ""During the past year, we've sought to engage in a constructive dialogue with the DC Attorney General's office to help them understand our business and to see if there were any areas for improvement,"" Dee said in the statement. ""We are disappointed they have moved forward with this lawsuit because our practices have always complied with DC law."" Racine previously negotiated a $2.5 million settlement with DoorDash after the attorney general sued the company, claiming it was using consumer tips to cover labor costs. Last year, Racine and Pennsylvania's attorney general also hammered out an agreement to require Uber Eats to clearly disclose that food purchased on its app may be more expensive than the same item at the restaurant. The D.C. suit is just the latest targeting Grubhub. Last year, Chicago filed a complaint against Grubhub and DoorDash for ""deceptive and unfair business practices that harm restaurants and mislead consumers."" The case listed many of the same practices as Racine's complaint, including misleading fees and deceptive campaigns to ""save restaurants"" during the pandemic. Grubhub filed a motion to dismiss the case in January, but Kristen Cabanban, a spokeswoman for Chicago's legal department, said the lawsuit remains ongoing. In Grubhub's statement, Dee said, ""We are deeply disappointed by [Chicago] Mayor [Lori E.] Lightfoot's decision to file this baseless lawsuit. Every single allegation is categorically wrong. We look forward to responding in court and are confident we will prevail."" In 2020, two class-action suits were filed against Grubhub and the way the company handles ""non-partner"" restaurants, those establishments that have not signed an agreement to be on the delivery service's app or website. One class action, filed in federal court in Colorado, argues that Grubhub was listing non-partner restaurants on its platforms, then claiming these places were not accepting online orders and redirecting diners to partner restaurants. The second class action, filed in federal court in Illinois, argues that Grubhub added more than 150,000 restaurants to its platforms without their permission, leading to confusion and problematic orders for customers. In the latter case, the plaintiffs claim that Grubhub started adding non-partner restaurants to gain market share, after a drop in earnings and share value in 2019. At the time, Grubhub sent a statement to Eater saying that the company started adding non-partner businesses ""so we will not be at a restaurant disadvantage compared to any other food delivery platform."" A spokeswoman also told Eater, ""We want customers to find the most restaurants when they land on Grubhub. When others in the space are doing this it's creating a gap, and we're closing the gap."" The plaintiffs in the Colorado case have worked with Grubhub on a proposed settlement, which they are trying to expand to include claims made in the Illinois class-action suit. But the attorneys in the Illinois case are objecting to the settlement, claiming Grubhub would not have to pay anything to the 150,000 non-partner restaurants that have allegedly increased the delivery company's value by $4 billion when they were added to the platform. ""The proposed settlement would also permit Grubhub to continue using restaurants' trademarks on its platform without first obtaining authorization and would prohibit restaurants from ever suing to stop Grubhub's ongoing trademark infringement,"" the objection claims.  Grubhub's Dee said the company believes the settlement would make it easier for restaurants to ""be removed from our platform if they wish to do so."" She also said all non-partner restaurants that filed declarations in the Illinois case have been removed from Grubhub. Both sides are waiting on the federal court in Colorado to rule on the settlement. In the months since those class-action suits were filed, Grubhub has been acquired by JustEatTakeaway.com, a giant Amsterdam-based food delivery company, in an all-stock deal valued at $7.3 billion. The acquisition gives JET a foothold in the U.S. market, but the newly merged company is already facing pressure to sell off Grubhub as JET's stock continues to tumble on the Amsterdam stock exchange. The company decided this year to stop publicly trading its stock in the United States.  Grubhub faces stiff competition for diners' dollars in the United States, where meal-delivery companies enjoyed massive, three-digit growth during the pandemic (but are dealing with inflationary pressures now). Grubhub lags well behind market leader DoorDash, which, according to one source, accounted for 58 percent of U.S. meal delivery sales in February. Uber Eats was second with 24 percent. Grubhub grabbed 14 percent of sales. Delivery orders at Bub and Pop's, the sandwich shop in Washington, don't follow the exact same pattern, but they have one thing in common: Grubhub lags behind the competition, says Fox, the assistant manager. On a recent day in March, she says, Bub and Pop's had about $150 in sales from Uber Eats and another $60 to $75 from DoorDash. The shop had only a single order from Grubhub, for $16. Then again, Grubhub may be looking toward a different strategy to grow sales. On Tuesday, McDonald's and JustEatTakeaway.com announced a long-term global partnership that would help grow the fast-food chain's McDelivery business.

24,1,Gas stations offer rebates to boost sales again,398 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"At one station in LambarÃ© it could be seen that it had a sign offering a reduction of G. 300 on some of its fuels. INCREASE. The beachgoers consulted pointed out that the level of sales of gasoline and of the two types of diesel improved considerably, after the Congress and the Executive repealed the law that granted a subsidy to Petropar. They agreed that the drop in sales, while the benefit for the state-owned company with common diesel and 93 octane naphtha remained in force, was higher than 50%. Yesterday, according to them, it is again at ninety percent. These price promotions are one of the practices resorted to by the operators to increase the volume of commercialization, even reducing the profit margin. On the other hand, according to inquiries made, a new increase in the private sector is ruled out for the time being. However, everything will depend on what happens in the next few days with the international price of oil, which is the main argument used to justify the last continuous fuel increases. Likewise, in the course of next week there could be new negotiations between the Executive and the private emblems, in order to see an option to reduce the impact generated by the high cost of common diesel on the economy in general. Crude oil price According to the portal PrecioPerÃ³leo.net, yesterday Brent oil for delivery in June traded in the order of USD 111.60 per barrel. That is, it rose USD 2.82. In the case of WTI oil for delivery in May, it indicates that it traded at USD 106.54 per barrel, up about USD 2.29 against USD 104.25."
896,0,Petition calls for IMDA to enforce SMS sender ID pre-registration after OCBC scams,444 words,The Straits Times,"This happened when the bank's customers received SMSes purporting to be from the bank, claiming there were issues with their bank accounts. Victims then clicked on a link that mirrored the OCBC website - but was actually set up by scammers - and were asked to key in their Internet banking account login details. The online petition, started by user Captain Sinkie on Change.org, pointed out that scammers can easily ""abuse"" the lack of a SMS sender ID pre-registration requirement in Singapore. It appealed to IMDA to consider enforcing such a requirement. While most banks use SMS number masking technology, in the case of the OCBC phishing scam, scammers managed to replace the phone number with an alphanumeric ""spoofed header"" or sender ID, which was the name of OCBC. The fake SMSes were also particularly believable as they showed up to customers in the same message threads of older but official OCBC messages. Currently, most countries including Singapore do not mandate pre-registration to send SMS messages with sender IDs. However, some countries such as Hong Kong, Armenia and Qatar do require pre-registration to send messages with alphanumeric sender IDs. IMDA has since urged more businesses and banks to participate in a government pilot it has set up in collaboration with Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which enables organisations to register the SMS sender ID headers they wish to protect. Under the Singapore SMS SenderID protection registry pilot which was set up in August 2021, messages will be blocked when there is unauthorised use of protected SMS sender IDs, said IMDA on Monday (Jan 17). It was responding to a forum letter submitted by a member of the public, who called for telcos to be the first line of defence against spoof traffic. ""The success of this measure, however, requires business and organisations such as banks to participate in the pilot, which would include registering the SMS sender IDs they wish to protect, and choosing the approved SMS aggregators that are allowed to send SMSes on the banks' behalf,"" said IMDA.

136,0,'I bought my first home on a credit card',1408 words,The Sunday Times,"Sarah Willingham cut her teeth in the hospitality industry at Planet Hollywood and Pizza Express. In 2004, in partnership with Clapham House Group (CHG), she bought the Bombay Bicycle Club, and after making it the UK's largest Indian restaurant chain, sold her share to CHG, becoming a millionaire. She continued to invest in the hospitality sector and in 2007 became an inspector on Raymond Blanc's BBC2 series The Restaurant. In 2015 she joined the BBC's Dragons' Den for two series before leaving to travel the world with her family. She lives in Brighton with her husband, fellow investor Michael Toxvaerd, and their four children, Minnie, 15, Monti, 14, Nelly, 12, and Marley, 10. How much is in your wallet? Nothing. In fact I don't even have an actual wallet any more. Everything is in my virtual wallet, attached to Apple Pay on my phone, and I don't miss cash except for perhaps giving buskers or homeless people a few quid. What credit cards do you use? I have the Platinum and British Airways American Express cards, which are great as we travel a lot and the lounge access and travel insurance is brilliant. I pay them off every month, although there have been times when credit cards have tided me over. Don't do this at home, but I actually bought my first house with a credit card. It was about 25 years ago, and I bought the 10 per cent deposit on a credit card when you could get cash back on it. It was a two-bedroom flat in South Hampstead, which ended up being a great investment. I paid off the Â£10,000 gradually over two years but my return on investment was much higher as the property market increased far more than any interest I was paying on the credit card. I'm not scared of debt. If you can get more return on your capital than the cost of borrowing, you're better off as long as you are mitigating your risk. I look at what's the downside in everything I do. The risk of doing this interview would be that my humility and normality would not come across and I'd look like a rich idiot. Don't write that. Are you a saver or a spender? I'm definitely not a saver. I'm a considered spender, but actually what I am is an investor, and that's different. I'm a typical entrepreneur. Every time anything was coming in I'd already earmarked it for another opportunity. How did the pandemic affect you? There was definitely a mild panic. Before our lockdown Mike and I just went, ""This is going to be absolute carnage.What on earth does this mean for our investments, for our businesses?"" Our worse-case scenario was that we'd lose everything. We're heavily invested in small businesses and all the bars we were involved with closed overnight. We had to take on significant debt and utilise government loans, but, like typical entrepreneurs, we react well to change. By the summer the demand for our Craft Gin Club had gone through the roof. That business is now worth over Â£100 million. And when the customer-facing businesses were reopened demand went stratospheric. In September 2020 we came up with Nightcap a late-night, high-quality party bar firm. We floated it in January 2021 for Â£12 million with zero bars and now it's worth Â£40 million with 27 bars and another 25 in the pipeline. I think hospitality is the industry to back now. Prices are low. Property is low. But demand is higher than ever. Have you ever been really hard up? Oh my God yes. In fact a lot more of my life than not. It has always been this compromise between cash and equity. I'd always put my last thousand pounds into an investment. I made my first million when I was 31 and it has been different since then. Before that point I lived in Paris in an awful flat in a dodgy area for two years and earned a normal salary. I lived on Pot Noodles. The flat was so basic that the lavatory was only separated from my bed by a shower curtain. It was disgusting, but it made me think I've got to get out of here. Do you own a property? We have a place in Primrose Hill, which we love and use. During our travels we decided to sell the lovely big country house in Oxfordshire and we're currently renting in Brighton, where the children go to school, trying to find what will be the next ten-year home. Are you better off than your parents? Yes, miles better. My mum was a maths teacher and my dad worked at Wedgwood Potteries as a supply chain manager. We lived in a lovely semidetached house with three bedrooms and a red Sierra parked outside. It was a gorgeous childhood, but I know that what I've achieved in my life has far exceeded everybody's expectations, including my own. What's better for retirement property or pension? I've got a pension as its tax efficient, and I've got property, but it's not where I create value and I'm not particularly good at property. The most important thing to consider with retirement is to do what you're good at. People talk about doing something you enjoy but that's a bit of a middle-class luxury. Do what you're good at. Liking something doesn't put bread on the table. What has been your best investment? The Craft Gin Club, definitely. I got involved with that on Dragons' Den five years ago there was a big fight between Peter Jones, Deborah Meaden and myself and I ended up investing Â£75,000 at a valuation of half a million and it is worth at least double that today. What's the most extravagant thing you've bought? Last summer I felt like I needed to give myself 20 lashes for buying Â£1,800 Chanel shoes. I could not believe I'd done it, but they were the most beautiful pair of shoes ever. We're probably talking Â£100 per wear. What's your money weakness? Apart from blimmin' school fees for my kids, which cost a fortune, my weakness is travel. I took my kids out of school for a year and we went around the world, which was amazing. It was the best thing I've ever done in my life. We had a daily budget of Â£400 for six people, which the kids managed. That's not bad for that many people but it does add up. What is your financial priority? Maintaining my freedom. I've always got my eye on independence. I just don't want anyone else to tell me what I've got to do on a Monday morning. Ever. What if you won the lottery? Go on more extravagant holidays. And I'd give back a bit more. My kids are still young, so I'm still focused on getting them though their education. My next chapter is to help others beyond my immediate family unit more. Do you support any charities? I'm an ambassador for In Kind Direct, which is one of the Prince of Wales's charities, and focuses on minimising waste. I also lost my best friend and childhood soulmate to suicide last year, so I think that I'll be increasingly involved with charities in that area. What is the most important lesson you've learnt about money? Money has never been a driver for me and that's really important. You've got to be driven by life goals. Money doesn't buy you freedom and independence, but it plays a very important part in completing the picture. Sarah Willingham is the founder of the bar company Nightcap I don't want anyone else to tell me what I've got to do on a Monday morning. Ever"

What are the allegations in the complaint? Rivian is an electric vehicle company that in 2018 unveiled its first consumer EVs, the R1T electric pickup truck, and the R1S electric SUV. On November 10, 2021, Rivian offered 153 million shares to the public through an IPO at $78.00 per share for total proceeds of $11.93 billion. The complaint alleges that the Registration Statement's representations were materially inaccurate, misleading, and/or incomplete because they failed to disclose, among other things, that the R1T and R1S were underpriced to such a degree that Rivian would have to raise prices shortly after the IPO and that these price increases would tarnish Rivian's reputation as a trustworthy and transparent company and would put a significant number of the existing backlog of 55,400 preorders along with future preorders in jeopardy of cancellation. As a result, the price of the Company's shares was artificially and materially inflated at the time of the Offering. A lead plaintiff will act on behalf of all other class members in directing the Rivian class-action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the class-action lawsuit.

243,0,"End of an era: Edinaâs Perkins closes for good // An $85M, 7-story apartment complex will replace the longtime neighborhood restaurant.",850 words,Star-Tribune,"The only Edina restaurant with a longer run than Perkins is the Convention Grill, which remains temporarily closed. Perkins was scheduled to close at 4 p.m. Tuesday, which made Monday the last night with full booths and an empty pie counter. By noon Tuesday, the only baked goods left were apple cinnamon muffins. Mac and Jill McGuire drove in for lunch Tuesday from Shakopee after hearing Perkins was closing. He walked out with the last banana nut muffin, a souvenir of the place where they spent many dates before getting married in 2008. âWe always looked at that big [American] flag flying when youâre coming down the highway. Weâre used to seeing that,ï¿½?Mac said. âItâs kind of like a landmark,ï¿½?Jill added. Cary Humphries, 92, came in for his customary breakfast, the one he would order five days a week and that servers knew by heart: dry rye bread, toasted twice, with plain oatmeal reheated in the microwave and a slice of banana on the side. âFussy old man,ï¿½?he joked. Humphries started a Bible study group 40 years ago that met at Perkins. Over the years, he said, he watched groups of Muslims go to Perkins to break their Ramadan fast. His three sons grew up going there, he said, and when his 90-year-old wife, Margot ï¿½?who has lived in a memory care facility for the last nine months ï¿½?recently stopped in with an aide for lunch, the servers âfawned over her,ï¿½?he said. The Edina Perkins also was the No. 1 stop after Friday night high school football games. Kids from Edina High would walk the few blocks to the restaurant, followed by families and finally the team, filling the entire restaurant. Four women who met in a grief-support group for parents who have lost a child started coming to the Edina Perkins 16 years ago and returned one last time Tuesday to the place where they had helped each other heal. âWe noticed we were laughing more than we were crying,ï¿½?said Mary Middlecamp, after the group posed for a picture outside the restaurant. A menâs group from Christ Presbyterian Church, which met every week at Perkins, posed for a photo Tuesday with Dan Gruendeman, a server for 23 years. They came with their families every Christmas to give Gruendeman a gift, and did the same Tuesday. âWeâve had Dan from Day One,ï¿½?said Dave Appelhof, one of a half-dozen regulars in the group. âItâs a family restaurant in more ways than one,ï¿½?Gruendeman said. âFamily style, and people end up being your family.ï¿½?Jen Ghilardi of New Brighton has worked as a server at 25 Perkins locations, but said Edina was her favorite. âI love the people here, and the employees are like family,ï¿½?she said. âA lot of the guests, they come in every day, sometimes twice a day, sometimes three times a day.ï¿½?Perkins will remove equipment and fixtures over the next few weeks before vacating the site. The building is expected to be demolished in March or April, with construction of the new development to follow. Employees have been grieving the impending loss and many plan to return this spring to watch the demolition. âWeâre still kind of in denial,ï¿½?Ghilardi said. About a dozen of the restaurantâs 40 employees will relocate to the Perkins in Bloomington off Interstate 494, and a few will transfer to locations in Maplewood and Roseville. A tearful Dowson looked around the crowded restaurant Tuesday, as longtime customers stopped to give her hugs. âWeâve seen these kids ï¿½?their parents were dating when they came here and the parents got married, had kids ï¿½?and now the kids are growing up,ï¿½?she said.

764,0,Conservative MP: Estonia should ban pro-Kremlin propaganda channels,579 words,BBC Monitoring Europe,"Russian propaganda channels are constantly attacking Estonia, as well as our close neighbours and allies, but Estonia has not taken any steps to protect its own information space yet. If your neighbour were yelling every day and for weeks that there would be violence in your residential building and that Estonians must be evicted, would you be sitting back calmly? Of course not, you would seek ways to stop this yelling. So why is Estonia passively watching how our eastern neighbour's propaganda channels are calling for violence, inciting inter-ethnic hatred and threatening [other countries] with war? Why is Estonia allowing broadcasts of pro-Kremlin propaganda, which endanger our security? Kremlin-produced state propaganda is delivered to the TV sets of Estonian people every day and every hour. These TV channels, which have been created for the sake of influence, are freely available in the standard packages of all our major cable providers and the Estonian state is simply looking on, passively. Some municipalities, like Tallinn, have even bought airtime from these channels. This, while other states have decided to fight Russia's fake news and propaganda. Both Latvia and Ukraine have taken steps to restrict Kremlin's propaganda channels. In addition to them, several countries that perceive and understand the danger of media operations from Russia. War propaganda and information operations threatening our security and conducted on Estonian territory must be confronted. This is the duty of the state in order to secure its citizens' and the state's own security. If the Kremlin's spokespersons are allowed to keep telling 100,000 Estonians, year after year, that the Estonian state is the devil's creation and that Russia will ""save"" all of Europe, then this is a clear threat to our independence. The most straightforward solution would be to block Russia's information operations: Russia's TV and Internet channels that are transmitting the Kremlin's propaganda should be banned. If the government does not have the political will for such a solution, the starting point could be to make people pay for these propaganda channels. The Isamaa party's nationalists made proposals to the effect before the Bronze Night [in April 2007] but they have always been bogged down due to Reform Party's opposition. In this sense it was especially strange to read [Reform Party MP and former interior minister] Hanno Pevkur's article [also calling on banning the Kremlin's channels]. It seems that Reform Party has not changed, they are simply focusing on Operation Save Kaja [prime minister Kaja Kallas, Reform Party]. An apparent fight on the Kremlin's propaganda fits this puzzle.

The main building burned down in the 1990s and was later rebuilt. Firefighters extinguished the blaze but remained at the scene pouring water on the structure Thursday evening, the newspaper said.

Bluenose owner Lafayette Hotels also declined comment."
461,1,Excelerate raises $384M in IPO underscoring investors' confidence in LNG,701 words,SNL Energy Finance Daily,"The company operates a fleet of floating storage regasification units, or FSRUs, which can be an attractive option for countries looking to ramp LNG imports in the near term. The offshore vessels typically can be developed faster than permanent import terminals, and FSRUs can be used temporarily before moving on to other markets. ""This war in Ukraine is certainly the most disruptive energy event in two generations,"" Steven Kobos, Excelerate's president and CEO, said in an interview. ""People are still working through that. Because of the desire for energy security, that pressure coming out of Europe is likely to force quicker decision-making even outside of Europe because everybody understands there is an asset class in the near term that can allow quick ability to flex up your LNG imports."" 'Investment deficit' in LNG Excelerate's 10 FSRUs represent more than a fifth of the world's global fleet. The import facilities can be sizeable; Kobos said Excelerate's FSRU in Karachi, Pakistan, delivers 4.5 million tonnes per year of LNG, or more than 1% of global production. The company's listing on the New York Stock Exchange marked the biggest IPO since January. It showed a significant shift in sentiment since Vine Energy Inc. in March 2021 became the first U.S. oil and gas company to pursue an IPO in years, only to get a chilly reception from Wall Street. Share prices of publicly traded U.S. LNG developers have also surged since the invasion, including the stock of Excelerate competitor New Fortress Energy Inc. On April 12, Excelerate sold 16 million shares for $24 each, at the high end of the company's target range. Shares were at $27.36 in afternoon trading April 13, about 14% above the offering price. Excelerate planned to use the proceeds of its IPO, valuing the company at about $2.5 billion, to fund new projects that address what Kobos described as an ""investment deficit"" in downstream LNG infrastructure. ""This isn't a liquidity event,"" Kobos said. ""This is all about fueling capital for growth projects."" Selling gas into Europe The company, founded in 2003 by oil and gas billionaire George Kaiser, has focused on developing LNG infrastructure to serve emerging markets, where gas can replace dirtier burning coal and support economic growth. Besides the U.S. and Pakistan, Excelerate operates in Brazil, Argentina, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bangladesh. Kobos said Excelerate is also working on an LNG import project in Albania that could supply more gas to Europe and said the company would continue to look for ""opportunistic plays"" in other European countries. Europe has spare LNG import capacity but not where it is needed to offset Russian gas supplies. The majority of spare capacity, 42.5 billion cubic meters per year, is on the Iberian Peninsula, which can only export 8 Bcm per year eastward to the continent, according to analysts at S&P Global Commodity Insights. In recent weeks, EU member states such as Germany have announced plans to secure new LNG import infrastructure to help reduce European dependence on Russian gas supplies. ""We have been thinking about how to integrate floating terminals as a means of selling gas into Europe for some time,"" Kobos said.

144,0,"Restaurant shake-up: Closures, movements and hot new openings in F&B",2264 words,The Straits Times,"While Summer Hill's chef-owner Anthony Yeoh searches for a new space, he is offering takeaway and delivery from a cloud kitchen in Orchard Road. Both Asia Grand and Loof - which closed last month (Feb) - are looking for new spaces. Other pending closures include nightlife and dining destination 1-Altitude at One Raffles Place on March 31, while the shutters come down on popular Ampang Niang Tou Fu in Katong on May 31. There will be more closures next month (April). Pin Si Restaurant @ Safra Yishun will call it a day on April 1, after 14 years in business, while seafood restaurant Captain K Seafood Tower in Middle Road will end its six-year run next month.Moving on Amid the slew of closures, there are new shoots of growth as old players reopen in new locations or expand their businesses. Nasi lemak specialist The Coconut Club in Ann Siang Road, which closes at the end of this month (March), is renovating its new all-day-dining location, which is slated to open in early May. Since reopening Nox - Dine In The Dark in Club Street last month (Feb), its owner Jesper Gustafsson, 38, has observed brisk business. The restaurant ceased operations in August last year after eight years in Beach Road. While its unique concept - where people dine in pitch-black darkness while being guided by visually impaired hosts - remains the same, its cocktail menu has been refreshed. For Mr Gustafsson, the challenge was finding a suitable location. He viewed more than 30 venues before deciding on the current space. He says: ""We found that many places were unsuitable due to space constraints or layout. We wanted to be in the heart of the city and the Central Business District."" Similarly for nine-year-old homegrown bistro Grub, it was tough to find a good home after moving out of Bishan Park last month. It will reopen in a 1,400 sq ft space next month at Novotel Singapore On Stevens. Grub co-owner Amanda Phan, 40, says: ""We were looking to find a park setting for the same kind of vibes, but nothing suited us, so we had to look beyond parks. ""This new unit may not be in a park, but there's plenty of greenery and it is a stand-alone outlet."" During the closure, Grub's popular cakes remain on sale from its cake production space at CT Hub 2. Ms Phan plans to open a second outlet in the second half of the year, hopefully at its home ground in Bishan.New openings It is not all doom and gloom in the industry, as a new slate of openings are in the pipeline over the next few months. Many high-profile names are also launching here - a sign that overseas brands deem it worth the investment to set up shop here. These include the debut of Japanese restaurant chain Nobu at Four Seasons Hotel Singapore; and Italian restaurant Fiamma by acclaimed chef Mauro Colagreco, in collaboration with Capella Singapore. Next month (April) also marks the highly anticipated return of Italian restaurant Osteria Mozza, which is opening in Hilton Singapore Orchard. It closed in 2018 at Marina Bay Sands (MBS). Famed Brooklyn pizzeria Roberta's opened at MBS two weeks ago. Its debut has been 18 months in the making and the 44-seat restaurant is run by a local team that trained at Roberta's in Los Angeles and its flagship in Bushwick. ""When we looked at expanding into Asia, Singapore was the perfect place for our first outpost. The city has a truly vibrant F&B scene and we believe we are able to build a Roberta's community in Singapore,"" says Mr Brandon Hoy, co-founder and co-owner of Roberta's, who is looking to scale up further in Singapore and the region. Looking ahead, Grub's Ms Phan remains cautiously optimistic. She says: ""Although the Omicron wave has been a bit scary, I expect Singapore to continue opening up and remain on track to recover from the pandemic. ""The F&B sector has been hard hit and we have been working amid all the disruptions. We just hope things go back to normal.""Jan & Feb openingsKi Teppan & Rogama PHOTO: KI TEPPAN & ROGAMA Where: B1-08/09/10/11 Palais Renaissance, 390 Orchard Road Feast on A5 Hirai or Hida wagyu, Japanese scallops and Australian live lobster cooked on the teppanyaki grill, or done rogama style - grilled over binchotan.

This year, TikTok extends its partnership with COMELEC through a dedicated on-platform election microsite. In addition to the removal of violative content, the 2022 Philippine Election Guide banner found on the Discover page will house a repository of accurate and reliable videos via the verified COMELEC TikTok account, to provide Filipinos with the information they need to take part in elections. We have also included leading global news agency, Agence France-Presse, to help verify harmful misinformation so that it can be removed from our platform. TikTok and GMA News and Public Affairs Launches its #eLeksyonSerye campaign TikTok has also teamed up with GMA News and Public Affairs, one of the country's foremost organizations for the coverage of the 2022 elections, joining 50 other partners comprised of the most respected names in the fields of telecommunications, media, education, business, law, and public service in the country, all of which have pledged their support to keep a close watch on the electoral process, and help voters make informed decisions on Election Day. The partnership enables GMA News and Public Affairs to take on a new approach in educating Filipino voters, beginning with the #eLeksyonSerye campaign, which officially begins on March 1, 2022. The campaign will feature a series of informative content leading up to the elections, including an interactive Online E-Leksyon Quiz that helps people determine how well they know their voter rights and responsibilities, and the country's political system.

TikTok's mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy, and it is in that spirit that it has chosen not to allow political advertising. This has been the platform's position since October 2019. Any paid ads that come onto the platform must fit the standards that TikTok has set, and the nature of paid political ads is not something the platform believes fits its experience. More specifically and as outlined in TikTok's advertising policy, it does not permit ads for the promotion, reference, or opposition of: a candidate for public office, a current or former political leader, political party, or political organization, content that advocates a stance (for or against) on a local, state, or federal issue of public importance in order to influence a political decision or outcome."

The same dates will set travellers back ï¿½?29 in the Hilton in Kilmainham and ï¿½?26 in the Maldron Hotel Parnell. Other popular hotels, including the Hard Rock Hotel and The Alex, have no availability for St Patrick's Day. Prices are similar in Galway city. For the same dates, customers will have to fork out ï¿½?45 for The Galmont Hotel and ï¿½?08 for Flannery's Hotel. The Western Citypoint Apartments are quoting ï¿½?,800 for their three-bedroom apartments, with only one currently available. Accommodation in Cork and Belfast is almost half the price of Dublin and Galway, with the Cork International Hotel charging ï¿½?28 for the same dates while The Dean is ï¿½?67. In Belfast, the Jurys Inn currently costs ï¿½?53 for March 17-19, while the Crowne Plaza is ï¿½?81.  FÃ¡ilte Ireland said it expects Dublin city to be busy for St Patrick's Day weekend and across the five days of the official St Patrick's Day Festival. ""It is wonderful to see the St Patrick's Festival return to Dublin this year,"" FÃ¡ilte Ireland's Head of Product Development Orla Carroll said. ""Festivals such as the St Patrick's Festival will be crucial as we work towards welcoming international visitors and the recovery of the tourism sector."" It is hoped across the hospitality and retail sector that St Patrick's Day will be the start of international tourists visiting Ireland again. CEO of FÃ¡ilte Ireland Paul Kelly said he expected a strong recovery in inbound tourism, with forecasts indicating Ireland will regain 83pc of 2019's air passenger capacity by the end of the year. Managing director of Retail Excellence Ireland, Duncan Graham, said the sector is confident it will be a good week of trading, and he hopes this is the start to Ireland regaining international tourists. ""We are quietly confident that it will be a good week of trading, usually what happens is St Patrick's Day itself can be different depending on where you are located,"" he said. ""In towns where there are parades going on, it's usually quite a flat day in that you are probably only trading in the morning and afternoon depending on what time the parade is. ""This is the first time we have had four days when people will have been off work together for a long time and I think a lot can also depend on what influx of tourists we get into the country over that period. ""So, generally I think it could be a good week for us, I certainly think businesses that rely on tourism will see some improvements that we haven't seen over the past couple years."" Mr Graham said he expects supermarkets and food shops to be busy on the run-up to the weekend, with many retailers opting for bank holiday hours on Friday, March 18. ""And then back to normal on the Saturday,"" he added. ""So I think in terms of trading hours it will be varied compared to what we normally see. ""Tourism on St Patrick's Day is the first start of the tourist season, so Carrolls Irish Gifts and shops like that will be looking forward to the return to somewhat normality."" He said footfall in city centres has significantly increased since before Christmas, but it is still below pre-pandemic levels. ""The really interesting point is, will this be the first sign of tourists coming back into the Irish economy because we have been very much dependent on staycation spending over the last two years,"" he said."

Please refer to the Appendix which sets out the Company's response s to substantial and relevant questions relating to the AGM 2022 resolutions received from shareholders. Where questions overlap or are closely related, they have been consolidated and rephrased. By Order of the Board  Genting Singapore Limited  Liew Lan Hing Company Secretary 15 April 2022  Genting Singapore Limited (Company Registration No. 201818581G) 10 Sentosa Gateway, Resorts World Sentosa, Singapore 098270 APPENDIX * A. Business Outlook and Strategy 1. * (a) With the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and reopening of borders, does the Group expect an increase in overseas travellers? What are the challenges faced and strategies in place? * (b) With reference to Page 5 of the Annual Report, the Chairman mentioned that the outlook for the tourism industry is still somewhat uncertain. What is Management doing to address the uncertainties and to ensure the viability of Genting's business? * (c) In terms of Resorts World at Sentosa Pte. Ltd. ("" RWS "") customer profile, which market is a significant segment, and what is Management doing to mitigate any COVID-19 related impact on such market? * (d) With the Japan integrated resort plan discontinued, will the Company focus on organic growth in Singapore for the near term? Business Outlook Since 1 April 2022, Singapore has reopened its borders to fully vaccinated travellers amidst further relaxation of COVID-19 related regulations. While we are encouraged by the gradual increase in footfall to our integrated resort, we anticipate visitors from our traditional markets will take time to return to pre-COVID levels. Amidst the disruptions brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has taken strides to reimagine our product offerings and visitor experiences, while investing in technology and innovation as well as in our talent development to position ourselves for growth opportunities. The Group has also been working closely with the Singapore Tourism Board and our industry partners to reinforce Singapore's destination appeal in our visitor source markets to prepare for travel revival. We continue to harness opportunities to refresh and build new visitor offerings to emerge stronger from the pandemic and capture upswing in demand. For example, RWS is refurbishing three of our hotels, namely Hard Rock Hotel Singapore, Hotel Michael and Festive Hotel which collectively offer over 1,200 keys. These hotels will undergo renovation works in phases from the second quarter of 2022 through 2023. When completed, Festive Hotel will be refashioned into a bleisure (business-leisure) and workation (work-vacation) hotel with a variety of mobile working spaces and lifestyle offerings that will meet new work trends. Importantly, Resorts World Convention Centre  Genting Singapore Limited (Company Registration No. 201818581G) 10 Sentosa Gateway, Resorts World Sentosa, Singapore 098270 will undergo refurbishment to strengthen RWS's position as a leading business destination that continues to meet the requirements of future MICE events. In addition, with tourists becoming more conscious about climate protection and conservation, RWS is increasing our commitment to sustainability in our day-to-day operations and fortifying our brand as a leading sustainable lifestyle destination resort, to capture the growing sustainable tourism market. In this regard, we have launched a series of green initiatives such as Eco-MICE packages that provide clients with the option to hold events at our MICE venues with the best green practices, and the RWS EcoTrail. Workforce transformation continues to be integral in our human capital development to re-skill, up-skill and transform our workforce to be future-ready, resilient and adaptive in meeting future challenges. Expansion Plans We are making good progress with the RWS 2.0 project. Construction works on both Minion Land and Oceanarium will start in the second quarter of this year. At a total investment commitment of $4.5 billion, RWS 2.0 is a multi-year project which will place us at the forefront of Singapore's tourism recovery. As for overseas expansion plans, following the discontinuation of the Japan integrated resort project, we continue to explore value-creating investment opportunities where there is good strategic fit with the Group ' s business. 2. What is the forward looking guidance for the Company for FY2022's full year Revenue and Profit? With Singapore's reopening of borders to all fully vaccinated travellers since 1 April 2022 and further relaxation of COVID-19 related regulations, we are cautiously optimistic of the recovery trajectory in 2022. We expect recovery in travel will initially be led by those visiting friends and relatives and business travellers. Discretionary leisure travel will take time to return to meaningful levels due to limited flight schedules and ongoing COVID-19 related travel rules and restrictions especially on our traditional markets such as China. The Company does not provide forward looking guidance with respect to its financial performance.  Genting Singapore Limited (Company Registration No. 201818581G) 10 Sentosa Gateway, Resorts World Sentosa, Singapore 098270 3. What is the expected annual expenditure timeline for the full $4.5 billion earmarked for RWS 2.0? As announced on 12 August 2021, as part of RWS 2.0 expansion plans, the Group had acquired leasehold land for the expansion of its integrated resort which amounted to over $800 million. Further, on 17 February 2022, the Group announced a total amount of about $400 million to be invested in 2022 for RWS 2.0 and related refurbishment works. RWS 2.0 is a multi- year project that will place the Group at the forefront of Singapore's tourism recovery when completed. The rest of RWS 2.0 will be completed in stages given the size of the project. The Company will provide further updates on material developments relating to the different phases of the RWS 2.0 project at the appropriate time. (B) Financials * 4. With reference to Page 61 of the Annual Report, there was a large increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment (FY2021: ~$942 million, compared to FY2020: ~$88.3 million). Please elaborate what the purchase was for. Similarly, with reference to Page 83 of the Annual Report, please explain the additional amount of ~$830 million to leasehold land, properties and improvements in FY2021. The increase in the purchases of property, plant and equipment in 2021 was largely attributable to the addition to leasehold land, properties and improvements which related to the acquisition of leasehold land amounting to over $800 million for the expansion of the Group's Singapore integrated resort , RWS 2.0. * 5. The Company will be subject to increased casino taxes from April 2022. Could the Company provide pro forma information on how FY2021 profits would have been affected if the new tax regime had applied? Under the new casino tax regime with effect from 1 March 2022, the casino tax rate increased from 5% to 8% of Gross Gaming Revenue for premium players and from 15% to 18% of Gross Gaming Revenue for other players. This 3 percentage point increase in casino tax will have a consequential negative impact on our net profit. Please refer to www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/tax-rates/casino-tax-rates[http://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/tax-rates/casino-tax-rates] for further details.  Genting Singapore Limited (Company Registration No. 201818581G) 10 Sentosa Gateway, Resorts World Sentosa, Singapore 098270 (C) Dividends and other questions 6. * (a) What is the effect of the expansion of Universal Studios Singapore ("" USS "") (RWS 2.0) on Earnings Per Share (""EPS"") and Dividend? * (b) With the discontinuation of the Yokohama integrated resort project, will dividends be increased in the near term? The expansion of USS is a key component of RWS's expansion plan ( RWS 2.0) which will add two new themed zones, i.e. Minion Land and Super Nintendo World, to the park with the aim to grow attendance and yield for a positive impact to overall EPS. The Group adopts a consistent approach to maintaining a balance between dividend payout that is aligned with shareholders' long term interest and prudent capital management for ensuring business needs and driving growth. * 7. Why has the Company never rewarded shareholders with hotel stay and dining packages? The Company aims to enhance shareholder value by deploying its resources in a manner which generates sustainable growth and profits. The Company rewards its shareholders by means of distributing profits generated from its business activities to shareholders periodically through dividends. * Original Link[https://docs.publicnow.com/06364BB8405788B083EB76CA13C8398F3A2B21BE]  Disclaimer  Genting Singapore Ltd. published this content on 15 April 2022 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

This Easter I am grateful to the vaccine creators, who have helped to reduce so much suffering, who have saved millions of lives and who allow many of us to rebuild our lives, as we once knew them. The Easter message of rebirth is welcome, then, and this year especially it will resonate far beyond Christian communities. In iweekend today, the Rev Kate Bottley writes with (presumably divine) authority that Easter is better than Christmas. It is ""the most wonderful time of the year"", she argues (page 25). Christians celebrate the resurrection of Christ following his crucifixion and death - the ultimate affirmation of Jesus's teachings and of Christian belief. And one need not have religious faith to believe in redemption, in renewal and in the potential for humanity to find salvation, even in the darkest hours. Happy Easter and good health to you. @olyduff"

(GATO) Securities Class Action: The litigation focuses on Gatos' statements concerning its Cerro Los Gatos (""CLG"") mine located in Chihuahua, Mexico, including the Company's estimates in its July 1, 2020 Technical Report (""2020 Technical Report"") that the CLG deposit ""contains approximately 9.6 million diluted tonnes of proven and probable mineral reserves."" According to the complaint, defendants made materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts, including: (1) that the 2020 Technical Report contained errors; and (2) that, among other things, the GLG mineral reserves had been overestimated by as much as 50%. The truth came to light on Jan. 25, 2022, when Gatos disclosed that during a resource and reserve update process, which included a detailed reconciliation of recent production performance, the Company concluded that there were errors in the 2020 Technical Report, as well as indications that there is an overestimation in the existing resource model. As a result, the Company estimated a potential reduction of the metal content of CLG mineral reserve ranging from 30% to 50% of the metal content and warned that the mineral resource and reserve estimates in the 2020 Technical Report should not be relied upon. This revelation drove the price of Gatos shares as much as 70% lower on Jan. 26, 2022. ""We're focused on investors' losses and proving defendants knew the 2020 Technical Report was inaccurate at the time of the IPO and thereafter,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

664,0,Russian State Media Bolster Putin's Narrative for Ukraine Invasion; Outlets amplify claims that Kyiv is the aggressor and that Russia is acting to protect its security,1616 words,The Wall Street Journal Online,"""The Armed Forces of Ukraine don't stop shooting at settlements of Donbas,"" Russia's Channel One reported Friday.  Read live updates on Russia's invasion of Ukraine[https://wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/livecoverage/latest-updates/russia-ukraine-latest-news]  Earlier this week, Mr. Putin ordered an invasion of its smaller neighbor and, on Friday, Russian forces had entered Kyiv[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/ukrainian-capital-rocked-by-explosions-as-russia-intensifies-attack-11645771768], Ukraine's capital, with fierce fighting[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/russias-assault-on-ukraine-presses-forward-as-street-battles-rage-in-kyiv-11645864200] that is threatening the government[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/once-a-comic-ukrainian-president-transforms-into-wartime-leader-11645794378] of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. State media has cited Ukrainian media saying residents of various cities, including the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, had heard several explosions and the sound of shelling. But Russian state news reports adhere closely to the Kremlin's narrative, repeated in statements by Russia's Defense Ministry, that their armed forces ""do not strike cities and towns [and] they take measures to save the lives of civilians."" On Saturday, a special edition of the political talk show ""60 Minutes"" aired on Russia's Channel One, showing residential buildings with shattered windows, blown-out walls and rivers of rubble on streets in the Russian-led Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, as a result of what was described as assaults by Ukrainian forces. Residents were shown picking through debris in their homes. Also on Saturday, Russia's communications regulator ordered the removal of reports from media that describe Moscow's attack on Ukraine as an ""assault, invasion or declaration of war,"" or face being fined or blocked. It accused several independent news organizations of publishing ""false informationâ¦under the guise of reliable messaging."" ""We emphasize that it is Russian official information sources that have reliable and up-to-date information,"" the agency said in a statement. On Friday, Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook said it would block Russian state media[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-02-26/card/facebook-blocks-russian-state-media-ads-CiNP4nf53Drbo25qgwkc] from running ads or making money from ads shown on its platform, after Moscow said that it was restricting access to Facebook in the country. The most prominent argument being promoted by pro-government figures and media to justify the invasion is that Ukraine has the potential to revive its nuclear arsenal and intends to do so with the purpose of targeting Russia. On Friday, one morning broadcast in Russia presented charts showing what it said was Ukraine's nuclear potential, including its ability to create what the presenter said was ""the most primitive, but no less dangerous"" so-called dirty bomb, or a conventional bomb that combines radioactive material. In 1994, three years after the demise of the Soviet Union, newly independent Ukraine agreed to give up its roughly 1,800 nuclear weapons, including short-range tactical weapons and air-launched cruise missiles, in exchange for security assurances from the U.S., the U.K. and Russia. This week, Moscow seized on recent comments by Mr. Zelensky regarding Ukraine's decision to cede the nuclear weapons as evidence of the threat Kyiv poses to Russia. Addressing the Munich Security Conference last weekend, Mr. Zelensky said today his country has neither those weapons, nor security for his country. But he added, ""We have somethingâthe right to demand a shift from a policy of appeasement to ensuring security and peace guarantees."" Moscow charges that Ukraine wants nuclear weapons with the intention of attacking Russia. Mr. Putin has often said that Kyiv ""has nuclear technologies created back in the Soviet times,"" specifying that some such weapons, including tactical missiles, have a range of over 100 kilometers, which is roughly 62 miles. And ""they can do more,"" the Russian president said in a televised address earlier this week. ""It's only a matter of time."" ""Ukraine intends to create its own nuclear weapons,"" he said, ""and this isn't just bragging."" If Kyiv is allowed to acquire ""weapons of mass destruction, the situation in the world and in Europe will drastically change, especially for us, for Russia. We cannot but react to this real danger.""  The Russian leader[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/putin-address-takes-swipe-at-u-s-led-world-order-11645485419] has also reminded Russians that their country is one of the most powerful nuclear nations in the world, warning that an attack on Russia would lead to defeat of any potential aggressor. On Friday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian responded, telling French radio that Mr. Putin ""knows very well that NATO is also a nuclear alliance."" Nikolai Sokov, a senior fellow at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, worked for Russia's Foreign Ministry between 1987 and 1992 and handled the portfolio of nuclear weapons that remained out of Russia following the demise of the Soviet Union. While Ukraine inherited a significant share of the USSR's nuclear arsenal, it didn't have launch control, Mr. Sokov said in an email. That was entrusted to Russia under two agreements brokered in 1991. The last weapons that Kyiv inherited from the defunct Soviet state were withdrawn from Russia in 1996, and while Ukraine has a rich history of nuclear research and has deposits of uranium, ""it has never had key elements of nuclear industrial infrastructure critical for building nuclear weapons,"" Mr. Sokov said. Further, even keeping Soviet nuclear weapons ""was de facto impossible,"" because they need regular maintenance, refurbishing and the replacement of components, Mr. Sokov said. Ukraine didn't have the capacity to dismantle nuclear weapons and didn't produce many of the essential components for replacement, he said. Today, building the necessary industrial infrastructure would take years and massive spending, and would encounter major opposition from the West, the analyst added. Rafael Loss, coordinator for pan-European data projects of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank, said the transfer of nuclear material was completed in 2001 and since then Ukraine has been fulfilling all of its obligations as a nonnuclear weapon state under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. ""International experts also do not consider Ukraine a likely proliferant,"" Mr. Loss said. ""Putin's claims to the [contrary] are supposed to conjure up an imaginary threat that has no basis in reality."" It is ""Russia that has modernized its vast nuclear arsenal in recent years [and] it has been the Kremlin that regularly threatens nuclear annihilation on countries that dare to stand up to Russia,"" he added. Russians like Elena Tarusova, 33, a mother of two from Bashkiria in the southwest part of Russia, said she supported the Kremlin's military campaign, because it was ""absolutely justified and necessary"" to expel what she described as the ""war criminals and henchmen of the West"" leading Ukraine. But some Russians are repudiating the state's narrative defending Mr. Putin's decision to invade Ukraine. On Thursday, at least 170 Russian scientists and journalists signed an open letter, protesting the military offensive. ""This fatal step leads to huge human losses and undermines the foundations of the established system of international security,"" the letter says. ""The responsibility for unleashing a new war in Europe lies entirely with Russia. There is no rational justification for this war."" Another antiwar petition, published on the Telegram messenger channel of Elena Chernenko, a journalist with the Kommersant daily business newspaper, had garnered almost 300 signatures by Saturday evening. The petition led to Ms. Chernenko being expelled from the Russian Foreign Ministry journalists' pool, she wrote on Telegram on Friday. Also on Thursday, crowds of Russians took to the streets across the country to denounce the move, defying a continuing crackdown on political opposition that has markedly raised the risks of dissent and seen almost all prominent activists jailed or driven into exile. OVD-Info, a group that monitors police detentions, said more than 2,440 people were detained across at least 58 cities for participating in what the authorities deemed as unauthorized gatherings on Thursday and Friday. Russia's Interior Ministry didn't respond to a request for information on the size of the protests but published that 600 people were detained in Moscow for joining the unsanctioned event on Thursday and didn't respond to subsequent requests for information regarding protests on Friday. Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Friday that Russian citizens were allowed ""have their own point of view,"" but weren't allowed to organize actions without ""following the appropriate procedures."" In a published statement, the Interior Ministry urged residents to refrain from participating in further illegal demonstrations. An antiwar petition on Change.org, entitled ""No To War,"" by Saturday evening had garnered almost 748,500 signatures. ""Putin ordered the start of a military operation against Ukraine, despite the terrible price that both Ukraine and Russia will undoubtedly pay for this war, despite all the voices of reason that sounded in Russia and beyond,"" the petition said. ""Official Russian rhetoric claims that this is done in self-defense. But history cannot be fooled,"" it said. Tatyana Pertseva, an independent film director in St. Petersburg, Russia's second city, said Mr. Putin's invasion of Ukraine made her uncomfortable. ""I am ashamed as a citizen of my country and I do not share this position,"" she said. ""Something is happening that should never be happening. All people must now unite in the struggle for peace.""

790,1,"anecdotes Launches Data Scoping Wizard, New Compliance OS Module Dedicated to M&A Activity",608 words,Business Wire,"anecdotes, the first operating system (OS) for Compliance, today announced the launch of a new module that will help streamline the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) process for companies spanning multiple Compliance standards, frameworks, and IT infrastructures. anecdotes' new Data Scoping Wizard will strategically support companies post-M&A by providing a unified workspace to manage their evidence collection processes and disparate Compliance programs. Mergers and acquisitions are one of the strongest catalysts of advancement and expansion for high-growth companies and can provide a great opportunity to scale. But while there is often a clear path for how to proceed before and during the M&A process, the post-M&A period frequently leaves GRC and Compliance leaders with multiple, siloed, and incongruous Compliance programs and standards that can expose companies to risk and hinder their ability to scale. Implementing true Compliance alignment and a unified roadmap are therefore increasingly critical to a successful integration post-M&A. anecdotes' Data Scoping Wizard now allows Compliance leaders to connect anecdotes' plug-ins from the environments of each subsidiary company and manage them all in the Wizard by selecting correlating data sources that provide evidence for each respective framework. The function will free Compliance leaders from chasing various internal stakeholders and enable GRC professionals to manage multiple iterations of SOC 2, PCI, or any other frameworks in the same dashboard. In turn, this helps: -- Create multiple framework instance: Companies can manage and modify dedicated frameworks for each subsidiary, with their own unique characteristics and data sources -- Connect various IT environments: Each company can keep its own infrastructure, and evidence from multiple sources can be collected and monitored in one workspace -- Collaborate across companies: Compliance leaders can manage each subsidiary's own Compliance program from a single pane of glass with specific tasks, timelines, and colleagues per company ""M&A is often such an exciting time for a company's trajectory, but can quickly turn tedious, stressful, and impact overall success when misaligned GRC teams are unnecessarily set up for disaster from the start,"" says Roi Amior, Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer of anecdotes. ""In our commitment to automating compliance for hypergrowth brands at all stages, we sought to create a dynamic and intuitive way to seamlessly integrate subsidiary Compliance programs during these critical milestones. Using a standardized, data-oriented approach, our Data Scoping Wizard solution harmonizes and optimizes these operations in ways not previously possible."" For more information visit anecdotes.ai.

In February 2021, the Government set price ceilings for RON95 gasoline and Euro 2M diesel at MYR2.05/l (US$51c/l) and MYR2.15/l (US$53c/l), respectively, to respond to the rise in crude prices. Under the new pricing mechanism, the authorities will cover the difference between the actual market price and the weekly retail price that is set on a weekly basis through the subsidy allocation. In 2020, the average prices of motor fuels fell to US$0.41/l (-18%) for gasoline and to US$0.44/l (-15%) for diesel. Previously, gasoline prices had been decreasing by -5%/year since 2017 and by -1%/year since 2018 for diesel. Gasoline and diesel are much cheaper than in ASEAN countries like Vietnam or Thailand.

847,0,Mailboxes of four people including ex-CEO rebuilt in INM data breach; Legal documents show entire contents of four mailboxes were copied onto USB drive,773 words,The Irish Times,"It says the mailboxes were then copied onto an encrypted USB drive that was handed over to a contractor with links to Leslie Buckley , Mr O'Brien's business associate and INM's former chairman who oversaw the illegal data search. The company's email system was also separately searched for information about the INM19, but only the four who previously worked for INM had their entire mailboxes reconstructed, it is suggested. The company also confirms that the operation was paid for by a company, Blaydon, ""of which Denis O'Brien is the beneficial owner"". Defence documents In the defence documents filed by Mediahuis Ireland in the case taken against it by Mr O'Reilly and Mr Brophy, the company also admits that it does not know if all the data exposed in the breach has been deleted by ""all persons who had access"" to the illegally harvested communications. Mediahuis Ireland and Mr Buckley are being sued over the data breach by Mr O'Reilly and Mr Brophy, who went on to found communications and lobbying firm Red Flag after they were ousted from INM in 2012 following a corporate battle with Mr O'Brien, who became INM's largest shareholder. Mr Buckley, who is separately being sued by Mediahuis Ireland for his alleged role in the affair, has already repeatedly denied all wrongdoing related to the data search, which the Data Protection Commission (DPC) has found broke the law. In its defence documents, Mediahuis also denies any wrongdoing and insists it is ""a stranger"" to why the data breach was carried out and the exact details. The company denies it caused or facilitated the data search and says it cannot be ""directly or vicariously"" held liable for the alleged actions of Mr Buckley, who was acting as its executive chairman at the time the data breach was carried out in secret in late 2014, prior to the appointment of a new chief executive. The company says Mr Buckley had been overseeing a cost-cutting exercise in 2014 known as Project Quantum. At the same time, it says access was granted to INM's back-up IT systems by people known to Mr Buckley, including IT expert Derek Mizak and John Henry, a private security consultant with links to him. Mediahuis says it does not know the extent of Mr Henry's involvement. Searches It says UK IT consultants sent a copy of a USB to Mr Mizak's company with the four reconstructed mailboxes, including those of Mr O'Reilly, Mr Brophy and two unnamed former employees. Mediahuis says the UK consultants also carried out the INM19 searches. It says the first it heard of the secret data operation was when the State's corporate watchdog, the Director of Corporate Enforcement Ian Drennan, asked for information about it in 2017. It says Mr Buckley told the company that the data operation was related to Project Quantum, but that it discovered that this was not correct in 2018 when Mr Drennan applied for High Court inspectors to investigate INM. The company denies that Mr Buckley was acting on its behalf or that it was part of a ""conspiracy"". It also attempts to apportion blame to Mr O'Reilly and Mr Brophy for any harvesting of their personal data, for using work emails and computers for such use. The company acknowledges that the DPC has already found it to be in breach of the law over the incident. Mediahuis Ireland, which recently changed its name from INM following the takeover of the business in 2019 by a Belgian group that bought Mr O'Brien's shares, previously failed with an attempt to stall the case pending the report of the High Court inspectors. Last month, it was given 42 days to file a defence or face having judgment entered against it."
865,0,Facebook trumpets massive new supercomputer,513 words,Agence France Presse,"""The experiences we're building for the metaverse require enormous compute power (quintillions of operations / second!),"" wrote Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook, referring to his idea of a 3D internet where users don virtual reality headsets and sensor equipment to create an immersive experience. The firm envisages developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools that will, among other things, allow people speaking in several different languages to understand each other in real-time. Meta said the machine, known as AI Research SuperCluster (RSC), was already in the top five fastest supercomputers and would become the fastest AI machine in the world when fully built in the next few months. Platforms like Facebook and Google have long been criticised for the way they process and utilise the data they take from their users. The two firms currently face legal cases across the European Union that allege data transfers from the bloc to the United States are illegal. And the AI algorithms that funnel Facebook users towards appealing posts have been criticised for helping to fuel disinformation and hate speech. Facebook has apologised repeatedly about the adverse effects of its algorithms and has long flagged its investment in content moderators and other measures to tackle problematic posts. European Digital Rights, a network of NGOs campaigning for big tech to be reined in, acknowledged on Monday that Facebook had made efforts to improve but questioned what the firm might do with such a powerful tool. ""Nothing good can come from all of that computer power in the hands of such a tech superpower,"" Diego Naranjo, the group's head of policy, told AFP. In a blog post announcing the supercomputer on Monday, two of Meta's AI research team stressed that weeding out harmful content was among the ""critical use cases"" for its AI development. The researchers wrote that high-definition video was creating ever greater demand for processing power at the same time as the company was pushing for AI tools based on trillions of examples. ""We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together,"" wrote the researchers. ""Ultimately, the work done with RSC will pave the way toward building technologies for the next major computing platform -- the metaverse, where AI-driven applications and products will play an important role."" Zuckerberg has been pushing harder than his big tech rivals to develop the idea of the metaverse. Facebook has not yet confirmed the location of its supercomputer, telling AFP the information was confidential. jxb/gw"
727,0,Social media wasn't ready for this war. It needs a plan for the next one.,1843 words,Washington Post.com,"The moves illustrate how Internet platforms have been scrambling to adapt content policies built around notions of political neutrality to a wartime context. And they suggest that those rule books ï¿½?the ones that govern who can say what online ï¿½?need a new chapter on geopolitical conflicts. ""The companies are building precedent as they go along,"" says Katie Harbath, CEO of the tech policy consulting firm Anchor Change and a former public policy director at Facebook. ""Part of my concern is that we're all thinking about the short term"" in Ukraine, she says, rather than the underlying principles that should guide how platforms approach wars around the world. Moving fast in response to a crisis isn't a bad thing in itself. For tech companies that have become de facto stewards of online information, reacting quickly to global events, and changing the rules where necessary, is essential. On the whole, social media giants have shown an unusual willingness to take a stand against the invasion, prioritizing their responsibilities to Ukrainian users and their ties to democratic governments over their desire to remain neutral, even at the cost of being banned from Russia. The problem is that they're grafting their responses to the war onto the same global, one-size-fits-all frameworks that they use to moderate content in peacetime, says Emerson T. Brooking, a senior resident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. And their often opaque decision-making processes leave their policies vulnerable to misinterpretation and questions of legitimacy. The big tech companies now have playbooks for terrorist attacks, elections, and pandemics ï¿½?but not wars. What platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok need, Brooking argues, are not another hard-and-fast set of rules that can be generalized to every conflict, but a process and protocols for wartime that can be applied flexibly and contextually when fighting breaks out ï¿½?loosely analogous to the commitments tech companies made to address terror content after the 2019 Christchurch massacre in New Zealand. Facebook and other platforms have also developed special protocols over the years for elections, from ""war rooms"" that monitor for foreign interference or disinformation campaigns to policies specifically prohibiting misinformation about how to vote, as well as for the covid-19 pandemic. The war in Ukraine should be the impetus for them to think in the same systematic way about the sort of ""break glass"" policy measures that may be needed specifically in cases of wars, uprisings, or sectarian fighting, says Harbath of Anchor Change ï¿½?and about what the criteria would be for applying them, not only in Ukraine but in conflicts around the world, including those that command less public and media attention.  Facebook, for its part, has at least started along this path. The company says it began forming dedicated teams in 2018 to ""better understand and address the way social media is used in countries experiencing conflict,"" and that it has been hiring more people with local and subject-area expertise in Myanmar and Ethiopia. Still, its actions in Ukraine ï¿½?which had struggled to focus Facebook's attention on Russian disinformation as early as 2015 ï¿½?show it has more work to do.  The Atlantic Council's Brooking believes Facebook probably made the right call in instructing its moderators not to enforce the company's normal rules on calls for violence against Ukrainians expressing outrage at the Russian invasion. Banning Ukrainians from saying anything mean about Russians online while their cities are being bombed would be cruelly heavy-handed. But the way those changes came to light ï¿½?via a leak to the news agency Reuters ï¿½?led to mischaracterizations, which Russian leaders capitalized on to demonize the company as Russophobic. After an initial backlash, including threats from Russia to ban Facebook and Instagram, parent company Meta clarified that calling for the death of Russian leader Vladimir Putin was still against its rules, perhaps hoping to salvage its presence there. If so, it didn't work: A Russian court on Monday officially enacted the ban, and Russian authorities are pushing to have Meta ruled an ""extremist organization"" amid a crackdown on speech and media. In reality, Meta's moves appear to have been consistent with its approach in at least some prior conflicts. As Brooking noted in Slate, Facebook also seems to have quietly relaxed its enforcement of rules against calling for or glorifying violence against the Islamic State in Iraq in 2017, against the Taliban in Afghanistan last year, and on both sides of the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 2020. If the company hoped that tweaking its moderation guidelines piecemeal and in secret for each conflict would allow it to avert scrutiny, the Russia debacle proves otherwise. Ideally, in the case of wars, tech giants would have a framework for making such fraught decisions in concert with experts on human rights, Internet access and cybersecurity, as well as experts on the region in question and perhaps even officials from relevant governments, Brooking suggests. In the absence of established processes, major social platforms ended up banning Russian state media in Europe reactively rather than proactively, framing it as compliance with the requests of the European Union and European governments. Meanwhile, the same accounts stayed active in the United States on some platforms, reinforcing the perception that the takedowns were not their choice. That risks setting a precedent that could come back to haunt the companies when authoritarian governments demand bans on outside media or even their own country's opposition parties in the future. Wars also pose particular problems for tech platforms' notions of political neutrality, misinformation and depictions of graphic violence. U.S.-based tech companies have clearly picked a side in Ukraine, and it has come at a cost: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and now Google News have all been blocked in Russia, and YouTube could be next. Yet the companies haven't clearly articulated the basis on which they've taken that stand, or how that might apply in other settings, from Kashmir to Nagorno-Karabakh, Yemen and the West Bank. While some, including Facebook, have developed comprehensive state-media policies, others have cracked down on Russian outlets without spelling out the criteria on which they might take similar actions against, say, Chinese state media. Harbath, the former Facebook official, said a hypothetical conflict involving China is the kind of thing that tech giants ï¿½?along with other major Western institutions ï¿½?should be planning ahead for now, rather than relying on the reactive approach they've used in Ukraine. ""This is easier said than done, but I'd like to see them building out the capacity for more long-term thinking,"" Harbath says. ""The world keeps careening from crisis to crisis. They need a group of people who are not going to be consumed by the day-to-day,"" who can ""think through some of the strategic playbooks"" they'll turn to in future wars.  Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have embraced the concept of ""misinformation"" as a descriptor for false or misleading content about voting, covid-19, or vaccines, with mixed results. But the war in Ukraine highlights the inadequacy of that term for distinguishing between, say, pro-Russian disinformation campaigns and pro-Ukrainian myths such as the ""Ghost of Kyiv."" Both may be factually dubious, but they play very different roles in the information battle. The platforms seem to understand this intuitively: There were no widespread crackdowns on Ukrainian media outlets for spreading what might fairly be deemed resistance propaganda. Yet they're still struggling to adapt old vocabulary and policies to such distinctions. For instance, Twitter justified taking down Russian disinformation about the Mariupol hospital bombings under its policies on ""abusive behavior"" and ""denying mass casualty events,"" the latter of which was designed for behavior such as Alex Jones' dismissal of the Sandy Hook shootings. YouTube cited an analogous 2019 policy on ""hateful"" content, including Holocaust denial, in announcing that it would prohibit any videos that minimize Russia's invasion. As for depictions of graphic violence, it makes sense for a platform such as YouTube to prohibit, say, videos of corpses or killings under normal circumstances. But in wars, such footage could be crucial evidence of war crimes, and taking it down could help the perpetrators conceal them.  YouTube and other platforms have exemptions to their policies for newsworthy or documentary content. And, to their credit, they seem to be treating such videos and images with relative care in Ukraine, says Dia Kayyali, associate director for advocacy at Mnemonic, a nonprofit devoted to archiving evidence of human rights violations. But that raises questions of consistency. ""They're doing a lot of things in Ukraine that advocates around the world have asked them for in other circumstances, that they haven't been willing to provide,"" Kayyali says. In the Palestinian territories, for instance, platforms take down ""a lot of political speech, a lot of people speaking out against Israel, against human rights violations."" Facebook has also been accused in the past of censoring posts that highlight police brutality against Muslims in Kashmir. Of course, it isn't only tech companies that have paid closer attention to ï¿½?and taken a stronger stand on ï¿½?Ukraine than other human rights crises around the world. One could say the same of the media, governments and the public at large. But for Silicon Valley giants that pride themselves on being global and systematic in their outlook ï¿½?even if their actions don't always reflect it ï¿½?a more coherent set of criteria for responding to conflicts seems like a reasonable ask. ""I would love to see the level of contextual analysis that Meta is doing for their exceptions to rules against urging violence to Russian soldiers, and to their allowance of praise for the Azov battalion"" ï¿½?the Ukrainian neo-Nazi militia that has been resisting the Russian invasion ï¿½?applied to conflicts in the Arabic-speaking world, Kayyali says. ""It's not too late for them to start doing some of these things in other places."" Correction: An earlier version of this story used an incorrect term for the Arabic language."

450,0,DoorDash dishes out grants to Boston-area restaurants,654 words,The Boston Globe,"DoorDash said Monday that it had chosen 17 restaurants to join its Main Street Strong Accelerator program, an initiative aimed at providing financial and educational support to businesses, particularly those owned by women, immigrants, and people of color. All of the Boston participants fall in at least one of those three categories. For Morad Bouzid, owner of Mo'Rockin Fusion in Boston Public Market, the support is âa tremendous help,"" after he put a hold on growing his business when the pandemic drove workers out of downtown. He hopes to open a brick-and-mortar restaurant in the future. âWe're trying to work with what we have right now,"" said Bouzid. âSo I was actually thrilled that I was picked."" Along with the cash, selected restaurants also will receive an eight-week curriculum with lessons on how to grow their business, one-on-one coaching, and merchandising and marketing benefits from DoorDash. The delivery app partnered with Accion Opportunity Fund, a nonprofit small business lender, to include curriculum centered on business growth, with courses such as âFinding Your Niche and Defining Your Brand,"" âHiring & Employee Relations,"" and âMarketing Like a Pro."" âWe focus on the areas that we know restaurant owners needed the most,"" said Tasia Hawkins, social impact program lead at DoorDash. âSo that business owners are equipped to not just have the capital to run their business, but to know what to do with that capital and deploy it in a way that will help their business grow for the long term."" Fiex Thevenin and Denise Omarde of Cafe Juice Up in Mattapan plan to use some of the grant money to address staffing shortages. Thevenin said he hopes to form lasting connections with other program participants. âAfter the cohort is done, I hope that everyone can always maintain a relationship where information and resources can be passed along,"" he said. âThe more people that can band together, the better off we all are.""  DoorDash already has rolled out the program in five other cities over the last year, including New York and Chicago. It's part of a broader five-year, $200 million Main Street Strong Pledge to strengthen local communities and their restaurants, Hawkins said.  DoorDash and other third-party delivery services have long been criticized by some restaurants for charging up to 30 percent for commissions on orders they deliver. Those criticisms grew during the pandemic, as struggling restaurants relied on delivery to survive, and thus had to share more of their proceeds with delivery apps. John Schall, owner of El Jefe's Taqueria in Boston and Cambridge, has advocated for a 15 percent delivery fee cap since the early days of the pandemic. Last January, the Massachusetts Legislature implemented this 15 percent cap, but the provision expired in June. Since then, Schall said, delivery fees on his orders have shot back up to 25 percent of the bill. For a restaurant that depends on delivery for nearly 40 percent of its business now, the fees are âa killer"" to profit margins, he said. âThere's lots of reasons why restaurants are struggling now, but this is certainly one of them,"" said Schall. Hawkins said DoorDash is âcontinually listening to merchant feedback,"" and cited its announcement in April to allow restaurants to choose partnership plans with delivery commissions starting at 15 percent. âWe're continually thinking about how to invest back into our merchants, and the Main Street Strong Accelerator is just one portion of that,"" said Hawkins.

351,0,Restaurant group Corbin & King allowed to join forces with US investment fund in shareholder row,454 words,City AM Online,"Thai hotel group Minor International was hoping to be granted an injunction to block a repayment, after the shareholder forced Corbin & King into administration last month over a loan. Mr Justice Foxton ruled on Tuesday that Minor should not be granted the injunction, meaning that Corbin & King will be able to take up an offer to repay loans to Minor. The groupâs co-founder Jeremy King had teamed up with US investment fund Knighthead, which has offered to repay a Â£34m sum owed to Minor. Marion Walsh-HÃ©douin, vice president of Minor Hotels, said the group had âserious concernsï¿½?before the pandemic about the restaurant groupâs operational level. The relationship between Minor and King âbroke down irretrievablyï¿½?when the co-founder filed a concocted petition in April 2021 seeking to force Minor International to sell its 74 per cent share.

932,0,Jamie Oliver's Â£1.75m windfall from ruins of collapsed restaurants - but suppliers who were owed millions after the collapse of his empire will get a fraction of that,913 words,Mail Online,"* The TV chef will recoup Â£1.75m after ploughing Â£15m of his cash into company * Meanwhile, creditors will have to share Â£600k that has been set aside for claims He's the super-rich TV chef who faced a spectacular downfall when his restaurant empire collapsed in 2018, owing millions of pounds to his suppliers. But Jamie Oliver can breathe a sigh of relief, as the Daily Mail's Richard Eden can reveal heâs recouped Â£1.75 million. This may, however, cause his suppliers to boil over. They include such prestigious names as Natoora, the fashionable organic veg supplier which sells to Michelin-starred chefs. The celebrity chef, 46, closed 22 of his Jamie's Italian restaurants with the loss of 1,000 jobs in May 2019 after profits plunged as customers stayed away. The business, Jamieâs Italian, owed around Â£83 million when it went bust. Oliver ploughed in about Â£15 million of his own money, and now Â£1.75 million will be paid to his holding company, Jamie Oliver Holdings Ltd. In January last year, the company's administrator KPMG revealed that the majority of the Â£83million owed to secured and unsecured creditors such as food suppliers, councils and landlords would not be recovered. Auditors said that while three Jamie's Italian restaurants and delis at Gatwick Airport remain open, the people owed money for the past eight months are likely to be significantly out of pocket. Now it has emerged that unsecured creditors, such as the suppliers owed millions, will have to share Â£600,000 that has been set aside for their claims. One of the largest debts to a supplier is the Â£221,494 run up by the chain with Direct Meats, based in Essex. The companyâs director, Martin Blackwell, said in a report on the firmâs trading for 2019: âIn the previous year we had established what we believed to be a strong relationship with Jamie Oliverâs Italian. 'And here we had seen more than a doubling in the business between the years 2018 and 2019. âWe were hugely let down by the businesses falling into administration, and without this our year-end figures, which are indeed satisfactory, would have been significantly improved and would have reflected the hard work and dedication of the officers and staff in taking Direct Meats forward.ï¿½?Oliverâs spokesman could not be reached for comment, but his spokesman previously said the chef had reached âmutually consensual termsï¿½?with his creditors. Jamie's Italian was the most high-profile fall from grace in a year when hundreds of restaurants closed across the UK. Around 1,000 jobs were lost at the Naked Chef's restaurants in 2019 when the company went into administration and more than 20 of his sites were closed. It was reported Oliver dipped into his own personal bank account to pay the wages of roughly 1,000 staff who have been made redundant. Some parts of the restaurant empire still exist in the form of 65 international sites in 25 countries. In August 2019 Oliver broke down as he visited Fifteen in east London, which he opened in 2002, as part of Channel 4 documentary Jamie Oliver: The Naked Chef Bares All. Both he and presenter Davina McCall became emotional as he talked her through what went wrong with his empire and the stress he had been under since. Oliver is rumoured to have a fortune of more than Â£200 million and recently applied for permission to extend his Â£3 million Essex mansion. He and his family hope to add three more bedrooms to their six-bedroom pile. Timeline: How Jamie Oliver's chains plunged into debt 2008: Jamie's Italian opened its first restaurant in 2008. 2015: Jamie At Home, which contracted agents to sell his cookware range at parties, ceased trading after racking up losses. The company began in 2009, as part of the Jamie Oliver organisation, before being licensed to another firm in 2013, but shut up shop in 2015. 2017: Jamie's businesses lost Â£20m, forcing him to shut 18 of his Italian restaurants - leading to the loss of 600 jobs. Chain was struggling with debts of Â£71.5m and teetered on the edge of bankruptcy before the chef injected his savings into the business. The firm also took out Â£37m in loans from HSBC and other companies. In 2017 he closed the last of his four his Union Jack Piazzas, in London's Covent Garden. 2018: Jamie's Italian shuttered 12 of its 37 sites, with the latter tranche executed through a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA). He also came under fire for failing to pay suppliers after his upmarket steak restaurant Barbecoa crashed into administration, leading to the closure of its Piccadilly branch. The restaurant in St Paul's continued to trade and was bought out by a new company set up by Oliver, who was no longer legally liable for the debts. 2019: All but three of Jamie Oliver's restaurants close after the business called in administrators, with 1,000 staff facing redundancy."
462,1,"Europe's 50 largest banks by assets, 2022",589 words,SNL European Financials Daily,"BNP Paribas, which in December 2021 agreed to sell its U.S. unit Bank of the West to Canada's Bank of Montreal for $16.3 billion and plans to reinvest proceeds from the deal in a new strategy running to 2025, had assets of ï¿½?.554 trillion as of 2021-end.  HSBC ranked eighth on Market Intelligence's global bank asset ranking, while BNP Paribas slipped two notches to place ninth. Another European lender that has opted to exit the U.S. retail banking market amid tough competition is Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, having closed the $11.60-billion sale of its U.S. business to The PNC Financial Services Group Inc. in mid-2021. BBVA remained in the 19th place on the list of Europe's 50 largest banks, with assets of ï¿½?19.45 billion. In contrast, Banco Santander SA, which has seen a steady increase in profits from the U.S. in recent years, has bolstered its exposure in unit Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. The Spanish lender also recently anchored its 2022 financial targets on expectations that it will maintain high profitability in the Americas. Santander dropped one notch in the asset ranking to place fifth, with ï¿½?.596 trillion in assets. Biggest movers Italy's UniCredit SpA fell three places in the list to claim the 15th spot. The bank was in lengthy talks with the Italian government to take over bailed-out peer Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA but ultimately backed out of a rescue deal. Following the collapse of the talks, CEO Andrea Orcel said the bank is open to exploring M&A deals that reinforce its franchise and enable it to meet its return on tangible equity target. UniCredit was forced to drop plans to take over Russia's PJSC Bank Otkritie Financial Corp. earlier this year due to rising geopolitical tensions. Spain-based Banco de Sabadell SA and Russia's VTB Bank PJSC each rose three places to rank 38th and 39th, respectively.  VTB, which is among Russian banks whose assets were frozen in recent months as part of international sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, had assets of ï¿½?44.42 billion. Fellow sanctions-hit Sberbank of Russia had ï¿½?82.37 billion in assets.

801,1,How sisters Rhea and Yeshoda Karuturi are revolutionising the pooja flower industry with Hoovu Fresh,959 words,Your Story,"Family business inspiration Belonging to a family business excelling in selling flowers, floriculture was an obvious choice for the sister-duo. They found an opportunity in selling pooja flowers via online channels. Yeshoda and Rhea started Rose Bazaar in 2019, which they renamed Hoovu Fresh in mid-2020. ""We both also worked in our family business after graduating college and this gave us an even closer perspective on how big the flower industry is. What shocked us though is that pooja flowers - a quintessential Indian use case - were missing from this picture. While the bouquet flower industry has grown by leaps and bounds, the pooja flower industry has remained largely unchanged for the past three decades,"" the Co-Founders say. Rhea has a Bachelor in Science, Technology and Society from Stanford University and Yeshoda has a Master's in Accounting and B.S in Business Administration from Washington University in St. Louis, USA. After completing her studies she worked in the family business, handling overseas operations in East Africa. Rhea Karuturi and Yeshoda Karuturi Starting Hoovu Fresh Hoovu means flowers in Kannada and the sisters wanted their brand to be uniquely Indian. ""When people think of pooja, they think about it in their mother tongues - and we felt Hoovu was a nice way to pay homage to tradition while staying fresh,"" says the duo. They note that the pooja flower industry in India is four times the size of the bouquet flower industry and when they started researching their product, they instantly knew it was going to be a big hit. ""Although this is a small wallet spend, the emotional quotient is very high and we've found that once customers use our flowers, there's no going back for them. Our customer love is how we knew this would be a success,"" they share. Since flowers are highly perishable, every minute from when they are picked to delivered is important. Hoovu says it has been able to increase its flowers' shelf life from two-to-three days to 15 days. Hoovu has 50 flower SKUs ranging from loose flowers to intricate garlands to greens such as Durva grass that are used in pooja. The prices start from Rs 25 and go up to Rs 1000. ""From day one, we focused on building a strong supply chain and working with farmers to ensure we receive the highest quality produce,"" they share, adding that their team is 90 percent women. Rhea and Yeshoda add, ""When the whole world is going after India's grocery stores, we are able to go after the ignored last mile in India - the millions of women who work as street vendors and their baskets, which startups are still to touch."" Pooja flower monopoly Hoovu Fresh enjoys monopoly in the ecommerce market in selling pooja flowers and sells their range of assorted flowers through marketplaces like Big Basket, Blink it, Fresh to Home, Zepto, Dunzo, Milk Basket, Supr Daily, Jio Mart, Zomato, Swiggy and more. As the startup was launched right before the country went for its first lockdown in March 2020 due to coronavirus, it suffered a slow down when the first lockdown was announced. However, it also learned that the lockdowns are only going to promote their business as more and more people switch to online platforms for all their basic necessities. They further add more people were looking for a company they could trust to sanitise the flowers and get them to them in a safe way. Hoovu introduced zero-touch flowers using their flower packing machine. Despite two years of economic slowdown, Rhea and Yeshoda say that they have seen a 10x growth in the past year and currently service 150,000+ orders per month. They currently service Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Mysore, Pune, Mumbai, Gurgaon and Noida and their agarbattis are available pan-India and they serve pan-India during festivals. Hoovu Fresh promotional picture ""We plan to bring our daily subscriptions pan India through our partner platforms and grocery stores,"" say the sisters. While Yeshoda and Rhea started their business with an angel investment of Rs 10 lakhs which they used in getting their first 1000 subscriptions, they raised a funding amount of $120,000 as part of the Techstars accelerator programme. Having run a business in the pandemic and witnessing a range of unicorn startups spring up in just the last year, the sisters are hopeful about the Indian startup ecosystem. They add, ""To be standing on the shoulders of these giants is a privilege and we are excited to add to this legacy. Post the pandemic, I think it's safe to say that Bharat is moving online and there's no turning this wave around. What more could young entrepreneurs ask for?"""

Earlier this month a group of 270 scientists and healthcare professionals signed an open letter to Spotify accusing the podcast of ""promoting baseless conspiracy theories"" and asking the service to take action against mass-misinformation events on its platform.

At home, it is battling to control the narrative, threatening restrictions on foreign and local media that stray from its official version of events. Photos and videos were slow to load on Facebook, owned by Meta Platforms Inc, and Twitter, both of which have been targeted by state communications regulator Roskomnadzor. ""VPN demand surged in Russia as authorities restricted Facebook and Twitter over the weekend in a bid to control the flow of information from its invasion of Ukraine,"" Top10VPN said. Russia banned several VPNs last year, but has failed to block them entirely, as part of a wider campaign critics say stifles internet freedom. In Ukraine, Russian hackers were blamed for a spate of cyberattacks that briefly knocked Ukrainian banking and government websites offline, days before the invasion. Russia denied involvement. VPN demand in Ukraine began noticeably increasing on Feb. 15 in light of cyberattacks, Top10VPN said, and skyrocketed after the invasion, with demand peaking 424% higher than the daily average in the first half of February.

Sussman Paradise Valley, Ariz. The ""revelations"" from the New York Times that Hunter Biden's laptop is real is all the more remarkable in highlighting the media's lack of introspection (""All the News That's Finally Fit to Print [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/all-the-news-thats-finally-fit-to-print-hunter-biden-laptop-new-york-post-new-york-times-joe-biden-11647637814?mod=hp_opin_pos_6],"" Review & Outlook, March 19). The media piously condemns Vladimir Putin's propaganda machine, and justifiably so, yet it seems blind to how it has blocked reporting on Biden Inc. The quarantining of valid, important news stories by the media here borders on propaganda. I predict the media will seriously examine the Biden family influence-peddling schemes late next yearâif the president's poll numbers haven't budged and he's showing a determination to run for re-election. The powers that be will then rediscover this scandal to get the president to re-examine his decision. Fred Van Bennekom Bolton, Mass. Some Republicans are arguing that this scandal, finally acknowledged by the New York Times, proves the 2020 election was ""rigged."" It would be unfortunate if this idea were used to support the dangerous view pushed by former President Donald Trump that he won the 2020 election. There's no doubt that the failure to pursue the disclosures in Mr. Biden's laptop was the most egregious example of media bias in our history. It very likely tilted the 2020 election to President Biden. The information on the laptop suggests he was profiting from his son's business dealings. Still, this is only another example of the media's alignment with the Democratic Partyâa flaw in our democracy, to be sure, but not different in kind from the obstacles Republicans face in every election.

594,0,"Government begins preparations for full closure of on-premises restaurants - entry into force ""three to four weeks away""*** TRANSLATED ***",715 words,STT,"The National Institute for Health and Welfare(THL) has recommended their complete exclusion. The facility has classified bars, pubs and nightclubs as high-risk events for coronary infections. On the other hand, according to the department, food and staff restaurants are places with a low risk of infection. Minister of Economic Affairs Mika LintilÃ¤(center) announced the start of preparations on Friday. According to the minister, the government is very united that low-risk restaurants should not be subject to further restrictions. The closure would not materialize immediately. - It probably talks about a three- to four-week timeline, because then Parliament will decide the law in due course, LintilÃ¤ said. The policy was made in the government's coroner's ministerial working group. According to LintilÃ¤, the introduction of the emergency law was not discussed at the meeting. The operation of the restaurants is already heavily regulated, as all restaurants will have to close in the evening and their customer numbers will be limited. Despite THL's recommendation, a total ban on liquor restaurants alone has been considered difficult by the government. Doubt has been caused by the specification of restaurants in the law. The law will be prepared in co-operation between the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. The latter has wanted to close all restaurants. The completed legislative proposal is decided separately in the working group of the Minister for Coronation. The support pot could be over 200 million It was also announced at the event, among other things, that the government is preparing a closure fee and a new round of cost subsidies for companies affected by various corona measures. The closure compensation would currently apply, for example, to sports and sports facilities that have been closed by an official decision. The cost support for companies subject to less restrictive restrictions would be the sixth in a row. There is also an event guarantee under construction that would allow for the planning of summer events. At the moment, Finland could only grant the guarantee until the end of June, but according to LintilÃ¤, the government intends to apply to the European Commission for permission to extend the guarantee until the end of September. In order to finance the support measures, the government is submitting an amending budget to Parliament at the beginning of February, when the government will also submit its bill on the matter. According to LintilÃ¤, the exact size of the compensation will only be decided when the duration of the various closures and restrictions is specified. He said tentatively that the total amount of aid could be between ï¿½?200 and ï¿½?250 million. - This is very difficult to assess, because the compensation for companies, events and event organizers is compensated in proportion to how they have had events and which days the companies have been covered by the closures, LintilÃ¤ said. Also unemployment relief Exceptions to the labor market support for entrepreneurs will also be extended due to interest rate restrictions. The government is making an amendment to the Unemployment Insurance Act, according to which labor market support can be paid to an entrepreneur again, even if the entire business does not cease. Minister of Labor Tuula Haatainen(sd.) Spoke at the press conference. Labor market support can be paid from January to February. The presentation is due as soon as possible. The deductible at the beginning of unemployment will also be abolished again, said Minister of Social Affairs and Health Hanna Sarkkinen(left). Unemployment insurance normally has a deductible for the first five days, during which no daily allowance is paid. According to him, preparations have already been made and the proposal will be submitted to Parliament as soon as possible. The policy would be valid from January to February. *** DISCLAIMER: THIS IS AN AUTOMATED TRANSLATION FROM FINNISH ***"

Many companiesâsuch as American Express Co ., Shell PLC and Boeing Co .âalready have announced plans to suspend or scale back [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/what-companies-have-pulled-back-from-russia-11646425481] their operations. Those moves came after Western governments imposed sanctions on the country [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/western-sanctions-bite-russian-economy-but-pose-unpredictable-risks-11646143908] in retaliation for the invasion, and financial firms took steps that could close off Russia from global markets [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/russia-ukraine-sanctions-banks-finance-11646428069].  McDonald's said it was temporarily closing its roughly 850 restaurants in the country and would continue paying the 62,000 people it employs in Russia. The company said it couldn't yet determine when it might reopen the restaurants in Russia and would consider whether any additional steps might be required Coke's business in Russia and Ukraine contributed about 1% to 2% of its operating revenues and income in 2021. The company had an ownership interest of about 21% in Coca-Cola HBC AG , Coke's bottling and distribution partner in the region, as of Dec. 31.  Coca-Cola HBC and PepsiCo both import soft-drink concentrates to Russia from Ireland and bottle drinks in local plants. Coca-Cola HBC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  Unilever PLC also said Tuesday it was suspending imports and exports of its products into and out of Russia. Unilever , which doesn't break out sales in the region, said it would continue to supply the essential food and hygiene products it makes in Russia.  PepsiCo is reluctant to shut down its Russian unit, which includes a large dairy business it bought for about $5 billion a decade ago [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/SB10001424052748703377504575651001344003896]. In an email to staff Tuesday, PepsiCo Chief Executive Ramon Laguarta wrote that the company has a responsibility to continue to operate there because tens of thousands of Russians depend on the company for their livelihoods and for daily essentials like milk and baby food. Revenue from PepsiCo 's Russian unit was $3.4 billion in 2021âa decline of 30% from its peak of $4.9 billion in 2013âmaking it the third-largest market for the company after the U.S. and Mexico. The impact of writing off the Russian unit would be minimal because it contributes little to PepsiCo 's earnings, some of the people familiar with the matter said. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli , who oversees one of the largest public pension funds in the U.S., wrote last week to PepsiCo , McDonald's and other companies, asking them to consider pausing or ending their operations in Russia.  PepsiCo has 20,000 employees in Russia. The company's 24 plants and three R&D centers there make soft drinks, potato chips, milk, yogurt, cheese, baby food and baby formula. The bulk of its Russian business is Wimm-Bill-Dann , a dairy-and-juice company PepsiCo bought in 2011 for about $5 billion. Officials at PepsiCo 's highest levels have discussed the geopolitical crisis in the region nearly every day since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, some of the people familiar with the matter said. For weeks they have evaluated different scenarios of how the business may be affected by supply-chain and other financial challenges stemming from the conflict and what steps PepsiCo may need to take, one of the people said.  PepsiCo could write down the value of its Russian business to zero, modeling the process it used for its Venezuelan operations [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/BL-CFOB-9366] in 2015, some of the people said. The Venezuelan unit is still operatingâand PepsiCo still owns itâbut it doesn't contribute to the soda-and-snack giant's earnings. If PepsiCo 's Russian unit manages to generate a profit as the nation's economy goes into a tailspin, PepsiCo is unlikely to be able to transfer those profits out of the country given the restrictions on transferring Russian rubles because of sanctions, one of the people said.  PepsiCo 's business there operates in rubles, uses locally sourced milk and potatoes and imports soft-drink concentrates. Its revenue has declined significantly since Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/why-is-russia-invading-ukraine-11645570205], and it now faces supply-chain challenges as Western countries impose sanctions against Russia, some of the people said. The company could take this opportunity to write off a business that hasn't generated as much revenue as the company had hoped, some of the people said. At the same time, PepsiCo takes a long view on emerging markets, and doesn't want to lose the goodwill of shoppers there, current and former executives said. Pepsi was among the first American brands to take hold in the Soviet Union. In 1959, the company organized a booth at the American National Exhibition in Moscow. With the help of Vice President Richard Nixon, PepsiCo executive Don Kendall offered a glass [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/pepsico-boss-donald-kendall-who-started-the-cola-wars-has-died-11600638498] to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, who agreed to several refills and declared it ""refreshing.''  PepsiCo opened its first plant in the Soviet Union in 1974 after agreeing to a barter arrangement in which the beverage giant took its profits in Stolichnaya vodka. The deal made Pepsi-Cola the first Western-branded consumer product bottled in the Soviet Union and gave it a leg up on rival Coca-Cola Co ., which wouldn't enter the market for more than a decade.  PepsiCo furthered its push into the region in 1988 when it became one of the first Western advertisers to buy commercials on Soviet television, including a pair of TV spots featuring Michael Jackson. Mr. Kendallâwho was PepsiCo 's chief executive from 1963 to 1986 and later served as an ambassador for the companyâbelieved that business could help build bridges between nations at a time of elevated tensions between the Soviet Union and the West. ""Trying to find a way through business to build relationships was something Don was very passionate about,"" said Michael White , a former executive who led PepsiCo 's overseas business from 2003 to 2009 and once met Russian President Vladimir Putin with Mr. Kendall. ""Unfortunately, it isn't what we all would hope.""  Coca-Cola 's entry in 1992 [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/SB111230664872794741], after the fall of the Soviet Union, brought the cola wars to Russia. PepsiCo opened its first snacks plant there in 2002. Then the rivalry moved to juices. Coke bought fruit-juice maker Multon Co. for about $500 million in 2005, and PepsiCo followed with the $2 billion acquisition of fruit-and-vegetable-juice business OAO Lebedyansky [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/SB120599648053851483] in 2009. Coke countered by buying Nidan Soki, another large juice maker. Then in 2011, PepsiCo bought OAO Wimm-Bill-Dann. The deal was PepsiCo 's second-largest acquisition ever after its 2001 purchase of Quaker Oats Co. [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/SB975872896745048674], and established PepsiCo as the biggest food-and-beverage business in Russia and a leader in the country's fast-growing dairy market. PepsiCo said it made the acquisition because it was looking for growth in emerging markets and wanted to expand into healthier foods and drinks. The company expected Russia to supply about $5 billion in annual revenue. After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the ruble tumbled and Russia fell into a recession that hurt the Russian businesses [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/pepsico-coca-cola-hellenic-to-close-russia-plants-1425330133] of both PepsiCo and Coke's bottler there, Coca-Cola HBC . The business unit now faces operational challenges as Russia's economy becomes increasingly cut off from the rest of the world. Russians tend to buy Western brands like Coke, Pepsi or Lay's potato chips when they have disposable income, but turn to cheaper local brands when money is tight, industry executives said. To manage inflation, PepsiCo 's Russian business may have to increase prices or decrease package sizes. And it may face supply-chain disruptions as sanctions disrupt shipments from other countries.

It will also close its retail banking operations in Tanzania and CÃ´te d'Ivoire to focus solely on corporate banking. The move marks a major shift for Standard Chartered, which has been among the biggest European lenders to invest in Africa in recent years at a time when rivals have been withdrawing. The bank intends to keep investing in Africa and the Middle East but ""remain disciplined in our assessment of where we can deliver significantly improved shareholder returns"", said the chief executive, Bill Winters. The cuts would allow it to focus on bigger and faster growing economies in the region, such as Saudi Arabia, where it has opened its first branch, and Egypt. The markets being exited generated around 1 per cent of total income in 2021 and a similar proportion of profit before tax, the bank said. Standard Chartered is present in 59 markets and serves clients in a further 83. It did not immediately comment on the number of job losses as a result of the cuts. The bank is joining the ranks of other global players to reduce their presence in Africa in recent years as they struggle to reach scale compared with incumbent locals while the region's economy has faltered. It has pursued a strategy of investing heavily in digital banking in Africa but, like other global lenders, has found it hard to translate customer acquisition into steady profits.  Barclays sold its African unit in 2016, ending a 90-year presence.  Credit Suisse pulled out of its wealth management business in nine African countries this year. Some lenders are still scaling up in Africa, with Deutsche Bank saying last year it will expand its private bank in the region.  Citigroup has pulled out of a host of Asian markets, while HSBC has decided to exit retail banking in France and the US. The economy in Sub-Saharan Africa, home to many of the world's poorest nations, contracted sharply during the pandemic and has struggled to recover."
736,0,The Sun records Â£51m loss as publisher fights costly phone-hacking cases,782 words,The Guardian,"Rupert Murdochâs News Group Newspapers, which publishes the Sun and retains liability for the activities of the defunct News of the World, spent Â£49m on legal fees and damages relating to historical phone-hacking allegations[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/dec/10/the-sun-says-it-didnt-hack-phones-so-why-does-its-publisher-keep-paying-out] in the year to 27 June 2021. This compares with the Â£80m NGN spent the previous year. The financial filings show the unnamed highest-paid director of NGN ï¿½?most likely Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of parent company News UK ï¿½?received a 50% increase in remuneration last year to Â£3.6m. On Thursday, NGN is beginning a two-day hearing at the high court in an attempt to bring an end to the ongoing managed hearings where new potential claimants start legal action each year. There have been hundreds of cases lodged[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/dec/10/the-sun-says-it-didnt-hack-phones-so-why-does-its-publisher-keep-paying-out] over the past 15 years ï¿½?in December NGN agreed a substantial settlement with the actor Sienna Miller[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/09/sienna-miller-says-sun-forced-her-to-make-decisions-about-pregnancy] to ensure her hacking claims did not go to trial ï¿½?with lawyers saying there could be thousands of potential victims still to come forward. In terms of the Sunâs financial performance, the company said turnover fell from Â£324m to Â£318.6m in the past year. Digital advertising and other customer revenues, including its betting and gaming operations, were able to partly offset the losses in print, it added. âThe decrease in turnover was primarily due to adverse print market conditions exacerbated by the pandemic, particularly in Monday to Friday sales, though performance has continued to improve since the first lockdown and throughout the financial year,ï¿½?the company said, in its filing to Companies House. âThere were declines in both newspaper circulation and print advertising revenues owing to an industry-wide acceleration in the shift in spend towards online.ï¿½?By contrast the Times and Sunday Times, also News UK titles, reported record profits over the same financial period, as digital revenues and cover price increases enabled them to buck the wider industry decline. Their parent group, Times Newspapers Limited (TNL), said pre-tax profits more than tripled from Â£10m to Â£34m year-on-year, the highest since the titles started making a profit in 2014. Revenues jumped from Â£310m to Â£327m. âThe increase in revenue was underpinned by strong growth in digital subscription revenue and digital advertising revenue which, supported by the impact of cover price increases across both titles during the period, were more than able to mitigate industry-wide declines in both newspaper circulation and print advertising,ï¿½?TNL said. Digital-only paid subscribers hit 399,000 as at the end of last year with total subscriber numbers, including print, passing 600,000.  Robert Thomson, the chief executive of News UKâs overall parent News Corporation, said at the publisherâs most recent trading update that the UK operation made its highest profit contribution for the companyâs second quarter to the end of December since 2011. The Christmas quarter also proved to be a milestone for the Sun, which reported that digital advertising income overtook print advertising for the first time. However, the scale of the challenge facing publishers was made clear this month when Reach, the owner of the Daily Mirror and Daily Express as well as hundreds of regional brands, announced that its market value had plunged by a quarter[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/01/value-of-daily-mirror-and-daily-express-publisher-reach-plunges-25-per-cent-after-it-warns-of-profit-squeeze] as it warned of significant cost increases. Reach said the existing issue of rising newsprint costs, caused by growing distribution costs and supply issues, was being exacerbated by soaring energy prices. NGN, which employed an average of 543 editorial staff last year, reported a total wage bill of Â£42.5m. The subsidiaryâs three directors, including the News UK chief operating officer, David Dinsmore, were paid a combined Â£6.7m, up from Â£4.5m in 2020. Last June, it emerged that Rupert Murdoch had written down the value of the Sun newspapers to zero[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jun/11/rupert-murdoch-writes-down-value-of-sun-newspapers-to-zero]. And last year, in a piece of Fleet Street symbolism, the Sun lost its title of UKâs bestselling newspaper to the Daily Mail[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/19/daily-mail-eclipses-the-sun-to-become-uks-top-selling-paper]. It had been the nationâs most popular paper since 1978. Most of the costs accrued relating to phone hacking are covered by Murdochâs US-listed Fox Corporation, which agreed to indemnify News Corporation when the businesses were separated in 2013."

540,1,Cummins Closes Acquisition of Engine Braking and Cylinder Deactivation Firm,358 words,M&A Navigator,"The acquisition of JVS also secures critical USMCA qualified engine components for current and aftermarket products and expands on Cummins Turbo Technologies' success with customers globally.  Cummins plans to maintain JVS' customer relationships and offer improved value and other benefits to the customers of both companies. Operations from the acquisition will report into Cummins Turbo Technologies, a business unit led by Shon Wright, vice president of Cummins Turbo Technologies, that resides within the company's Components segment. The acquisition also represents another step forward in Cummins' continued investment in key technologies to advance its path to zero emissions strategy that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower the air quality impacts of their products. Engine braking and cylinder deactivation technologies will be key components to meeting current and future emissions regulations, and this acquisition would allow Cummins to better integrate valuable components with its emissions-leading medium- and heavy-duty engines. Founded in 1961, JVS has roughly 600 employees and more than 60 years of experience in engine retarding and valve actuation systems for the commercial vehicle industry. Since then, more than 9m engine brakes have been produced by JVS for commercial vehicles throughout the world. There is also historical linkage between JVS and Cummins. In 1961, JVS introduced the first engine brake, commonly referred to as the ""Jake Brake"" for commercial vehicles, which was invented by Clessie Cummins, the founder of Cummins Inc. JVS has two primary manufacturing facilities in Bloomfield, CT and Suzhou, China, and Cummins expects to invest additional capacity and resources into their operations. JVS' manufacturing footprint will also help Cummins meet USMCA requirements and further invest in the US ((Distributed via M2 Communications - http://www.m2.com[http://www.m2.com]))"
797,0,China accused of hacking emails of journalists working for Rupert Murdoch's News Corp in US and UK,1562 words,Mail Online,"* News Corp said breach last month accessed emails and documents of staff * Company added that cybersecurity firm Mandiant had 'contained' the attack Journalists working for Rupert Murdoch's media empire News Corp in the US and UK have had their email accounts hacked in an apparent cyber attack linked to China. The New York-based group said employees at the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post as well as staff at its News UK division - which owns The Sun and The Times in Britain - had all been affected in the hack, which accessed some workers' data. The hack was discovered on January 20 and the firm's internet security adviser claimed it was likely aimed at gathering 'intelligence to benefit China's interests'.  News Corp said the breach accessed emails and documents of a 'limited number' of employees, but added that cybersecurity firm Mandiant had 'contained' the attack. The company, founded by the Australian-born media mogul, said its online security experts did not believe any financial or user data had been targeted by the hackers, suggesting they were only interested in information relating to its journalism.  News Corp said other business units including HarperCollins Publishers, Move, News Corp Australia, Foxtel, REA and Storyful were not targeted in the hack. All staff received an email from the firm's chief technology officer David Kline and chief information security officer Billy O'Brien informing them about the attack.  News Corp's email to sent to employees Cyberattacks from China on global businesses are all too frequent in today's connected environment, as FBI Director Christopher Wray reminded us earlier this week, when he spoke of China's 'massive, sophisticated hacking program that is bigger than those of every other major nation combined.' While News Corp has protections in place, we appear to have been the target of persistent nation-state attack activity that affected a limited number of our employees. Even though the vast majority of our people's emails and documents were not the target of this attack activity, we take seriously any attack on our organization and our employees, including our journalists. On January 20th, News Corp discovered attack activity on a system used by several of our business units. As soon as we discovered the activity, we notified U.S. law enforcement and launched an investigation with the assistance of Mandiantâa leading cybersecurity firm. As part of our efforts, we promptly took steps to contain the activity and our investigation to date indicates that the systems housing customer and financial data were not affected. In addition, we have not experienced related interruptions to our business operations. Based on our investigation to date, we believe the threat activity is contained. Although we are in the early stages of our investigation, we believe the activity affected a limited number of business email accounts and documents from News Corp headquarters, News Technology Services, Dow Jones, News UK, and New York Post. Our preliminary analysis indicates that foreign government involvement may be associated with this activity, and that some data was taken. Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus and believes they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests. Our highest concern is the protection of our employees, including our journalists, and their sources. We are working closely with the leadership teams of the affected businesses to inform those employees whose accounts were impacted and help them take appropriate measures. As an employee, if you are not contacted directly about this activity, we do not believe your account was targeted. To our knowledge, this activity was not targeted at our other business units, including HarperCollins Publishers, Move, News Corp Australia, Foxtel, REA, and Storyful. We will not tolerate attacks on our journalism, nor will we be deterred from our reporting, which provides readers everywhere with the news that matters. We believe it is important that other media organizations be made aware of this threat in order to take appropriate precautions, and we are providing technical details of the attack to the Media Information Sharing and Analysis Organization. We are continuing to work through the investigation. If you have pressing questions, please speak with your manager. We also encourage you to review the cyber-secure guidance we have shared previously. Thank you for the critically important work you do every day to serve our readers, viewers, and customers. David Kline EVP, Chief Technology Officer Billy O'Brien Chief Information Security Officer The message, which has been seen by MailOnline, said: 'Although we are in the early stages of our investigation, we believe the activity affected a limited number of business email accounts and documents from News Corp headquarters, News Technology Services, Dow Jones, News UK, and New York Post. 'Our preliminary analysis indicates that foreign government involvement may be associated with this activity, and that some data was taken. 'Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus and believes they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests.' The hack will raise concerns over the safety of confidential sources, with News Corp saying it was now working with staff whose accounts were affected. The email continued: 'Our highest concern is the protection of our employees, including our journalists, and their sources. 'We are working closely with the leadership teams of the affected businesses to inform those employees whose accounts were impacted and help them take appropriate measures. 'As an employee, if you are not contacted directly about this activity, we do not believe your account was targeted. 'To our knowledge, this activity was not targeted at our other business units, including HarperCollins Publishers, Move, News Corp Australia, Foxtel, REA, and Storyful.'  News Corp called in the cybersecurity firm Mandiant when it discovered the attack - with the news first revealed today by the Wall Street Journal, sourced from a filing by News Corp to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  News Corp added that their experts did not believe any financial or user data had been targeted by the hackers. Its email to staff said: 'On January 20, News Corp discovered attack activity on a system used by several of our business units. 'As soon as we discovered the activity, we notified U.S. law enforcement and launched an investigation with the assistance of Mandiant - a leading cybersecurity firm. 'As part of our efforts, we promptly took steps to contain the activity and our investigation to date indicates that the systems housing customer and financial data were not affected. In addition, we have not experienced related interruptions to our business operations. Based on our investigation to date, we believe the threat activity is contained.' The Chinese Embassy in the United States did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters today. Earlier this week, FBI director Christopher Wray said the threat to the West from the Chinese government is 'more brazen' and damaging than ever before. He accused Beijing of stealing American ideas and innovation and launching massive hacking operations. His speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library amounted to a stinging rebuke of the Chinese government just days before Beijing is set to occupy the global stage by hosting the Winter Olympics. It made clear that even as American foreign policy remains consumed by Russia-Ukraine tensions, the US continues to regard China as its biggest threat to long-term economic security. 'When we tally up what we see in our investigations, over 2,000 of which are focused on the Chinese government trying to steal our information or technology, there's just no country that presents a broader threat to our ideas, innovation, and economic security than China,' Mr Wray said. The FBI is opening new cases to counter Chinese intelligence operations every 12 hours or so, with Chinese government hackers stealing more personal and corporate data than all other countries combined, Mr Wray said. 'The harm from the Chinese government's economic espionage isn't just that its companies pull ahead based on illegally gotten technology. While they pull ahead, they push our companies and workers behind,' Mr Wray said. 'That harm - company failures, job losses - has been building for a decade to the crush we feel today. It's harm felt across the country, by workers in a whole range of industries.' Chinese government officials have repeatedly rejected accusations from the US government, with the spokesman for the embassy in Washington saying last July that Americans have 'made groundless attacks' and malicious smears about Chinese cyber attacks. The statement described China as a 'staunch defender of cybersecurity'. The threat from China is hardly new, but it has also not abated over the last decade. 'I've spoken a lot about this threat since I became director in 2017', Mr Wray said. 'But I want to focus on it here tonight because it's reached a new level - more brazen, more damaging, than ever before, and it's vital - vital - that all of us focus on that threat together.'"

549,0,"Sober truth Dry January isn't virtuous. As bars struggle to move past COVID, it's just selfish",538 words,New York Post,"Fellow New Yorkers, this January I urge you to quash your inner Gwyneth Paltrow, put down the green juice, and put on something other than cashmere joggers. Hit your local watering hole and order up. ""The last two years have been tough on this industry as a whole,"" said Brittany Belfiore, a bartender at the Elgin in Midtown, where business has tanked in recent weeks after previously picking up. ""The other night I went into the beer cooler and cried for almost 10 minutes . . . There's a bunch of people that usually come in for lunch and I haven't seen them."" If Belfiore's midday regulars are skipping their daily tipple in the name of Dry January, what's the point this year? There's nothing to recover from. By mid-December, New Yorkers were getting COVID in droves and scrapping Christmas travel plans. Offices weren't hosting festivities, and Broadway and other attractions were hobbling along or giving up entirely. Nights out on the town and holiday excess were limited or nonexistent. Belfiore estimated that she's lost about $3,000 in income over the past two months, initially due to the Omicron surge and now the deadly new variant known as Dry January. Temporary health nuts are turning beloved bars into wastelands at a moment in history in which there have never been more reasons to drink. A Morning Consult poll estimated that 19 percent of Americans are partaking in Dry January this year, up 6 percentage points from 2021. The worst offenders might be those who feel safe enough to go out, but are holier-than-thou enough to not order an adult beverage. ""The other day a guy was here with his friend,"" said Teresa Maher de la Haba, a bartender at McSorley's Old Ale House in the East Village. ""And the friend said 'No, I'm not drinking. Dry January,' and just ordered a bit of food."" Johnny Schultz, a McSorley's employee for decades, didn't mince words when asked about his feelings on the annual sober foray. ""[It] sucks!"" he yelled. Too right. An optimistic Maher de le Haba thinks we're rounding the corner with both the virus and our drinking habits and that business will pick up next month. And she has a suggestion: ""Dry January. Then No-Mask February!"" A poll found that 19% of American adults are doing Dry January this year"

307,0,5 ways supply-chain problems are affecting hotels,1009 words,MarketWatch,"For many, supply chain issues mean something like the grocery store is out of oat milk, so youâre stuck with soy instead. For hotels ï¿½?an industry already hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic ï¿½?supply chain issues are causing even bigger problems. Vimal Patel knows this all too well. Patel is CEO of QHotels Management, which operates franchises of hotel brands, including some Hampton Inn, Holiday Inn and Best Western properties. Lately, heâs scrambling to find towels, shampoos, notepads and other supplies his hotels run through (and run out of) due to supply chain problems. âEver since the pandemic, serving paper products like plates and napkins, as well as food itself, has become a huge problem ï¿½?and a customer service challenge,ï¿½?he says. âGuests often donât understand why a product is unavailable.ï¿½?Things got heated at one of his hotels, which advertises 12-ounce cups of coffee. âWe could only find 8-ounce cups, and we couldnât find any lids,ï¿½?Patel says. âWe had to use a substandard cup, because thatâs all we could get. That was deeply upsetting to some customers.ï¿½?See: Supply-chain woes may have peaked [https://www-marketwatch-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/story/this-new-gauge-says-supply-chain-woes-may-have-peaked-11641409305]  For weary travelers seeking to caffeinate, lidless coffee might feel like a reason to leave aÂ one-star review, especially for unpracticed travelers who might not be accustomed to the myriadÂ COVID-related travel changes [https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/what-did-covid-change-in-travel-that-likely-wont-go-back-to-normal?utm_campaign=ct_prod&utm_content=1129862&utm_medium=wire&utm_source=syndication&utm_term=anne-stanleymarketwatch-com].

Patel typically orders items from an approved vendor, which previously took about 48 hours to arrive. âNow, it can take months,ï¿½?he says. âYouâre lucky to get it within three weeks.ï¿½?Towels are typically reordered every other month, as they get discolored after enough use (and some just disappear). Yet, bulky items like these are tough to stockpile, since most hotels have limited storage space. âWeâll have a family of four use all the towels in the morning, and then ask for a second set in the evening,ï¿½?he says. âSometimes we just donât have enough.ï¿½?Amid the coffee cup shortage, Patel had to send an employee to Costco to buy whatever cups they could find. âWith basic necessities, itâs hard to tell a customer, âWe donât have that,ï¿½?so sometimes you just have to make it work,ï¿½?he says.

Hotels reported a 79% cost increase on day-to-day cleaning and housekeeping supplies, a 77% increase for linens and other soft goods, and a 77% increase in food and beverage supplies, according to a November 2021 survey of about 500 hotel operators conducted by the American Hotel & Lodging Association. Staffing issues are ongoing In a separate AHLA survey from October 2021, 94% of respondents said their hotels are understaffed (including 47% who say they are severely understaffed). Additionally, 96% of hotel operators said they are trying to hire, yet are struggling to fill open positions. And for an already overworked hotel employee, dealing with a customer upset about their undersize coffee cup can be extra challenging. Construction challenges compound the problem The coffee chaos was small beans for Patelâs business, which operates in Louisiana. Nearly half of his properties are closed due to flooding and roof damage in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida. He says local home improvement stores are out of materials, and construction workers are tough to hire. While the hurricane brought extra challenges for Louisiana businesses, hotels nationwide are experiencing construction-related issues. In the first year of the pandemic, many hotels put off planned renovations. Now, it might be too late to renovate without going over budget. Construction material costs jumped nearly 20% in 2021, according to an analysis by the Associated General Contractors of America. In a separate AGC survey from winter 2021, 90% of contractors attributed such issues to the supply chain, and 72% said projects take longer than anticipated because of COVID-19. What to expect during your next hotel stay Travelers are returning, but labor and materials still havenât ï¿½?and the outlook isnât exactly promising. Of the AHLA survey respondents, 36% said they expect supply chain disruptions to last at least another year.

It means you might not have the exact amenities youâre used to ï¿½?and that sometimes, the amenities you expected will not be available, period. Patel says he hopes customers will understand the challenges that the hotel industry faces. âWeâre not cutting corners because weâre trying to nickel and dime,ï¿½?he says. âItâs simply the situation weâre in.ï¿½?And just as a hotel likely wants you to feel like youâre at home, Patel says he hopes people realize the supply chain shortages felt at home are hitting his industry too. âWhether itâs finding groceries or a roof for your own home ï¿½?theyâre the same challenges that businesses are facing, but 10 times,ï¿½?he says.

574,1,Amazon CEO Andy Jassy echoes Bezos' year-old pledge to curb warehouse injuries,524 words,Puget Sound Business Journal,"Last year Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, in his final annual letter to shareholders as CEO, pledged to make the company ""Earth's Safest Place to Work."" Jassy, like Bezos, acknowledged in his letter the serious-injury numbers, but also tried to mount a nuanced defense against the reported data. ""Our injury rates are sometimes misunderstood,"" Jassy wrote. ""We have operations jobs that fit both the 'warehousing' and 'courier and delivery' categories. In the last U.S. public numbers, our recordable incident rates were a little higher than the average of our warehousing peers (6.4 vs. 5.5), and a little lower than the average of our courier and delivery peers (7.6 vs. 9.1)."" The injury rates are per 100 workers. The reported rates show Amazon is ""about average relative to peers,"" Jassy said, ""but we donât seek to be average. We want to be best in class."" To achieve that lofty goal, Jassy said the company has ""researched and created a list of what we believe are the top 100 employee experience pain points and are systematically solving them.""  Amazon declined to disclose what those ""pain points"" are.  A recent report[https://www-bizjournals-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/seattle/news/2022/04/12/amazon-warehouses-employees-injuries-rose-2021.html] from union-backed Strategic Organizing Center said the serious injury rate for Amazon's warehouses grew 15% in 2021 from the previous year, from 5.9 per 100 workers in 2020 to 6.8 in 2021. Jassy also pointed to Amazon's recent growth as a reason injuries have ticked up. ""At our scale (we hired over 300,000 people in 2021 alone, many of whom were new to this sort of work and needed training), it takes rigorous analysis, thoughtful problem-solving, and a willingness to invent to get to where you want,"" he said. However critics and regulators say that Amazon's required work pace contributes to elevated injury rates. That pace comes from Amazon's commitment to customers to shorten the time it takes to get a package to a front door, and the spike in demand the company faced amid widespread lockdowns during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. In Washington state alone, the company has added over 25 fulfillment centers and delivery stations since 2019 and tens of thousands of employees. While some of these additions were planned and started before the pandemic, many were a part of Amazon's furious logistics expansion. ""We spent Amazonâs first 25 years building a very large fulfillment network, and then had to double it in the last 24 months to meet customer demand,"" Jassy said.

443,0,High roller fails to stop Aussie casino from suing over alleged $44m debt,574 words,The Straits Times,"""The judgment in the Singapore proceeding made it clear that it was only by the procedural defence, available to Dr Wong in that forum, that the case was dismissed,"" wrote Judge of Appeal Philip McMurdo last month on behalf of the appeal court. The Star Entertainment had sued Dr Wong in the Singapore High Court in February 2019 for purported losses at the casino in Queensland between July 26 and Aug 2, 2018. The Star sought to recover A$43,209,853.22, which is the value of a dishonoured cheque he had signed that breached a cheque cashing facility agreement inked with him. In the Singapore International Commercial Court decision grounds issued in 2020, International Judge Jeremy Cooke had held that The Star's claim fell foul of Section 5(2) of the Civil Law Act, citing a previous Court of Appeal decision. The section prohibits the recovery of gaming debts, subject to certain exceptions. Court documents said that a year earlier in 2017, Dr Wong had travelled to Australia and gambled at a Sydney casino operated by a company related to The Star. On that trip, he signed a blank cheque, but left it undated with the payee and the amount blank. In a deal he made with The Star in 2018, it was agreed that if Dr Wong provided ""a replacement cheque"" to The Star with the amount and date left blank, The Star was authorised to complete that cheque with an amount equal to what was outstanding and to date the cheque. Based on that provision, The Star filled out the cheque, inserting the amount of S$45,145,654.64, the date of Sept 7, 2018, and its name as the payee. The Star deposited the cheque into its account with the National Australia Bank, but by then Dr Wong had taken action which resulted in the cheque being dishonoured, according to court documents. In the current lawsuit, which commenced in 2020, The Star claimed A$43,209,853.22 as damages for breach of the facility agreement. Dr Wong, a Singaporean, applied but failed to have the lawsuit dismissed or obtain a stay on it by a Brisbane judge. He then took his case to the Court of Appeal which dismissed his case with costs. The court said last month in its judgment: ""What is clear is that The Star has endeavoured throughout to prosecute its claim to a determination on the merits. ""In hindsight, the Singapore proceeding could be said to have caused an unfortunate delay in the ultimate resolution of this dispute."" But such a criticism about delay was not sufficient evidence to say that The Star's conduct in filing this lawsuit in Queensland ""would serve to bring the administration of justice into disrepute"", said the court."

72,1,EXCHANGE --- Business News: Steinway Plans IPO on NYSE,417 words,The Wall Street Journal,"The New York company hasn't been listed on a stock exchange since 2013, when it was bought for about $512 million and taken private by Paulson & Co., the hedge fund founded by billionaire John Paulson. This time it plans to use the stock symbol STWY, a departure from last time around when it used LVB as a tribute to Ludwig van Beethoven. A spokeswoman for Steinway declined to give a date for the initial public offering or say how much money it plans to raise. Proceeds of the IPO will go to Mr. Paulson, his firm and other stakeholders, according to the filing. A spokesman for Paulson & Co. didn't comment. A Steinway grand piano costs between $60,000 and $340,000, according to the filing. A smaller, upright piano starts at $40,000. The company also sells brass and woodwind instruments through its Conn-Selmer line. The Spirio, a self-playing piano, is its priciest model, making up about 32% of its total piano sales last year, the filing said. The Spirio appeals to those who don't know how to play but still want to hear one playing in their house, according to the company.  Steinway reported revenue of $538 million in 2021, up 29% from the year before, according to the filing. Net income rose 14% to $59 million in the same period. The company's filing said it wants to sell more pianos in China, where it says sales of luxury goods are growing and more children are learning to play the piano than in other parts of the world. It opened a Beijing store in 2017. ""China represents a unique market for Steinway due to two primary cultural and structural factors,"" the filing said. ""A deep-rooted reverence for classical music, specifically piano music, and a sizeable and rapidly expanding middle and upper class with an appetite for luxury Western products."" Steinway was founded in 1853 by Henry Engelhard Steinway, a German immigrant who developed the first Steinway piano in a Manhattan loft.

289,1,Central Ohio leaders eye sales tax increase to fund $8B in transit investment,649 words,Columbus Business First,"Newly released LinkUs plans include an $8 billion investment in enhanced and expanded transportation options. That investment would be funded via a half a percentage point tax increase, upping the portion of the local sales tax that goes to COTA from .5% to 1%. The overall sales tax rate is currently 7.5% in Columbus; with the increase it would be 8%. Joanna Pinkerton, COTA's CEO, said the authority's board of trustees is currently deciding whether to place the sales tax increase on the November ballot. Pinkerton said construction along some of the high-capacity corridors identified by the plan could start in 2024 if the increase is approved this fall. The proposed COTA sales tax increase would generate $61 million annually, or $1.65 billion through 2050, Pinkerton said. The municipalities in COTA's service area, all of Franklin County and small portions of Union, Delaware, Licking and Fairfield counties, would vote on and, if approved, pay the sales tax. Pinkerton said the sales tax is important for securing federal funds because it shows a dedicated local match. An important part of the plan for implementing LinkUs is leveraging local funds to secure federal grants made available through the federal bipartisan infrastructure bill. Pinkerton said the increased sales tax is on par with other cities and regions of our size. The portion of Cincinnati's sales tax that goes to their regional transit authority is .8%. As of 2020, Cincinnati's overall sales tax rate is 7.8%, according to the Ohio Department of Taxation. Cuyahoga County's overall sales tax rate is 8% and the portion of Cleveland's sales tax that goes to its transit authority is 1%. Columbus City Council President Shannon Hardin told Columbus Business First that the region can use the LinkUs initiative as a tool for growth. ""A city that stays the same falls behind,"" Hardin said. ""We can't afford to stay the same when it comes to our mobility options, we have to improve. And at this step, we know that it's going to mean we need to make significant investments as a region in our mobility options. We believe that where we are with the federal government and the opportunities that we have for matching resources and partnerships, that we don't want to miss out on that."" Early investments in infrastructure under the plan could include improvements to sidewalks, bike paths and intersections, said MORPC Executive Director William Murdock. Murdock said LinkUs would be transformative for the region. ""What we're seeing with LinkUs, is it is it builds on all the momentum we have of these different plans to make this community get in front of growth, make this community the one that we want it to be,"" Murdock told Business First. Murdock said the idea is to encourage ""transit-oriented development."" That means growth would be focused in key areas with job centers, like the West Broad or East Main corridors. The initiative will make communities along the corridors, like Franklinton, the Hilltop or the Near East Side, more walkable and bike-friendly. By 2030, the region would include three high-capacity rapid-transit corridors, with more to come by 2050. Pinkerton said those corridors would offer more frequent, reliable public transportation service via dedicated lanes for more sophisticated vehicles. Did you find this article useful?

That day, more than 30,000 Russians queued up [https://apnews.com/article/8ac60db52ea3e600b61a148e8ab52d05] the first day to get a taste of the âBolshoi Makâï¿½?breaking a world record. It was a year after the fall of the Berlin wall, and a year before the Soviet Union was dissolved. Change was in the air. Reporter Yuliya Chernova [https://twitter.com/ychernova/status/1501265234908135426] was there. âOh, the deliciousness of the milkshake, my first taste of America at the Moscow McDonaldâs in the early 1990s,ï¿½?she tweeted. âWhile mom waited at the US embassy to submit our refugee papers, grandma & I stood in the snaking McD line.ï¿½?The crowds were so large that dozens of policemen were sent to control the commotion. Russians were so unused to seeing smiling people serving them that, according to one account [https://www.rbth.com/history/329911-ussrs-first-mcdonalds], McDonaldâs employees were asked to smile less. With a large population of around 144 million, western companies were clamouring to reach Russians eager for western culture. Call it the arrival of American capitalism or soft power, the point was the same: Russia was integrating into the rest of the west again. But it was not meant to last. Western companies now feel they have no choice but to leave again. On Twitter , people called for boycotts of companies for sitting on the fence. Writer Amy Siskind tweeted [https://twitter.com/amy_siskind/status/1501027434367524871]: ï¿½?@McDonalds and @pizzahut say they will continue to do business in Russia. Their immoral choice, and they should face boycotts at home! Drive past, and #BoycottMcDonalds#boycottpizzahutï¿½? Ukrainian supermarkets also started boycotting western brands that refused to leave. A New York state official warned major companies [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/mcdonalds-russia-closure-ukraine-boycott-b2031340.html] that they face âsignificant and growing legal, compliance, operational, human rights and personnel, and reputational risksï¿½?by remaining in Russia.

If the invasion continues beyond a few months, and keeps claiming lots of civilian lives, companies may have to stay out permanently. Moreover, the Russian government is McDonaldâs restaurants along with assets of other large companies. Who would want to risk going back into Russia anytime soon? Clearly, Putin has to be sanctioned, and cutting off the Russian government from international trade is appropriate. Western sanctions were necessary. But if anyone thinks this might make Russians think twice about Putin, they are likely to be disappointed. When people feel their country or identity is under attack, they usually grow defensive. The international isolation of Russia may very well play into Putinâs hands. Take Coca Cola as an example. In 1977 the Indian government threw the iconic brand out of the country [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/george-fernandes-the-minister-who-threw-coca-cola-out-of-india-stalled-hpcl-privatisation/articleshow/67743096.cms] for not allowing local manufacturers access to its secret formula. Rather than lamenting Coca-colaâs demise, Indians embraced local brands (Thums Up, Limca, Gold Spot) with enthusiasm. Even after the company returned in 1993, it never quite managed to topple home-grown companies. As one writer put it [https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/what-is-thums-up], âThe opening up to the world helped Indians become more aware of their own culture, and thus arose an emotional urge to support deserving Indian brands.ï¿½?To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment sign up to our free weekly Voices newsletter by  clicking here [https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnewsletters%3Fitm_channel%3Dnative%26itm_campaign%3Dfooter%26itm_audience%3Dprospecting%26itm_content%3Dnewsletters&data=04%7C01%7CVictoria.Richards%40independent.co.uk%7C062b3d811f2541e4220808d98fb59a11%7C0f3a4c644dc54a768d4152d85ca158a5%7C0%7C0%7C637698832400255119%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=cljURBTtBLaWfVwBrZv8UPgOVVFGM0rPoexRmk0aRHA%3D&reserved=0]  American brands didnât just represent American culture in Russia, they illustrated the strength of capitalism over communism. They showed people another world was possible; that Soviet communism wasnât the best way to organise society. Now, the departure of brands like McDonaldâs , Coca Cola , Netflix and Starbucks takes away that vision. A generation of Russians will grow up with limited access to western culture and ideas. That doesnât sound like a positive development to me. China is another precautionary example. When the communist party banned platforms such as Facebook , Twitter , Whatsapp and Google Search, many thought this would stymie its tech industry. But the government created home-grown alternatives (WeChat , Weibo and Baidu ). These companies arenât as globally powerful as western brands, but they are more easily controlled by the government. By keeping Chinese people within its own sphere of influence, they are less influenced by foreign ideas of democracy and individual liberty. America is cutting off the very symbols of western culture many Russians liked about it, giving Putin more opportunity to shape Russia in his own image. The west may end up regretting this boycott."
452,1,Savills IMâs Jeffrey: There will be more industry consolidation,891 words,Real Estate Capital,"The London-headquartered real estate manager, which has ï¿½?4 billion of assets under management across Europe and Asia, led by example last year when it completed the acquisition of DRC Capital[https://www.recapitalnews.com/savills-ims-jeffrey-savills-owned-drc-can-be-a-leading-global-debt-player/] ï¿½?a debt fund manager which was formed in London in 2012. The business, now known as DRC Savills Investment Management, is among Europeâs most experienced non-bank real estate lenders, investing in commercial real estate debt across all major sectors. Speaking to Real Estate Capital Europe, Jeffrey said he believes more corporate acquisition activity is happening across the industry as real estate acquisition, management and loan underwriting is becoming increasingly complex. âBoth on the equity and debt side, the process [of investing in real estate] is becoming more intensive and requires significantly larger resources than was ever the case,ï¿½?Jeffrey said. âFirms getting bigger also enables them to spread the cost of that expertise across a wider pool of assets under management, therefore keeping fees low for the benefit of clients.ï¿½?Smaller, more niche operators will not, however, fall by the wayside, he believes. âMany of them will continue to thrive if they have strong expertise. But some of them will look to partner up with the larger players because they will not be able to handle this increasing weight of responsibility,ï¿½?he added. Fruitful marriage Another element of industry consolidation is managers opting to operate equity and debt strategies. âThere are increasing combinations of firms that are becoming providers of both equity and debt,ï¿½?said Jeffrey. âWe see very strong synergies between the real estate debt and equity side.ï¿½?He added that Savills IM believes lenders in the real estate space need to understand the ownership of assets. âYou have to underwrite the investment as if you are going to be an owner because that could be one of the outcomes ï¿½?it is not the one you plan for, but it is the one you need to be ready for,ï¿½?said Jeffrey. âWe believe that debt platforms being part of organisations that have broad real estate networks and capability means they have got a much greater pool of knowledge to draw upon. This underpins the whole rationale to bring the debt and equity side of our business together ï¿½?a key driver behind the consolidation, and I think you're going to see much more of that.ï¿½?Sector focus While Savills IM is not currently active in North America, venturing into US territory might be on the cards in years ahead. âWe don't have any immediate plans for expanding into North America, but we would not rule it out,ï¿½?said Jeffrey. âThis year, we see plenty of opportunity to grow our business in Europe and Asia, [as we identify] a wide range of attractive investment opportunities and a lot of investor interest.ï¿½?Across the companyâs target markets of Europe and Asia, it is witnessing continued investor demand in industrial and logistics ï¿½?with Jeffrey citing the most interesting opportunities for both debt and equity investments being in the âmid-boxï¿½?segments such as urban and last mile, logistics, light industrial estates and coastal storage sub-sectors. âEuropean industrial logistics offer strategies that include big boxes, but obviously those have increased in price dramatically,ï¿½?he said. âThe benefits of continuing to focus on that sector are not driven purely by cyclical economic fundamentals, but it is also about structural growth.ï¿½?Structural growth stems from the urbanisation trend which is putting pressure on land values in and around cities across Europe, he continued. âVery similar trends are at play in Asia-Pacific as well, which is actually a less mature market, so there are arguably greater opportunities there for development and redevelopment,ï¿½?he added. Another area the firm finds compelling is residential. âThis space offers investors diversification because it's not particularly well correlated with commercial and offers durable income streams. It's not as cyclical as commercial sectors. The sector is much less mature as an institutional investment proposition both in debt and equity terms than it is in other parts of the world like, like North America.ï¿½?There is a range of different types of residential investment that can deliver strong returns including multifamily, student housing and senior living, he added. âDifferent locations, each of those have varying importance, but overall, we're seeing a lot of opportunities here. The most important factor is demographics.ï¿½?Urbanisation and the growth of single-family rental is creating greater demand particularly in Europe and Asia. âWhere construction has not kept up with that demand, it is pushing up house prices and rents and creating a significant affordability problem in most cities. And so, to identify the right opportunities in the right locations and be sure that the projects are designed correctly incorporating ESG are the primary considerations, with which there are attractive returns to be achieved for both debt and equity investors,ï¿½?he said."
189,0,Retail - A&W restaurant chain to close,434 words,Bangkok Post,"The doors of all 24 A&W restaurants will simultaneously close on March 20, confirmed Glocon chief executive Nopporn Phatthararuchi, but its licence to operate them will expire on March 31. Glocon acquired a master franchise licence to operate A&W restaurants in Thailand in 2018 under NPP Food Incorporation Co. A&W sales are currently less than 100 million baht, down from almost 200 million baht in 2018. Louise Taechaubol, Glocon's executive chairwoman, earlier said that A&W is the group's only business unit that remains stuck in the red, and the company had delayed its investment plan for the restaurant chain for 2020 and 2021. With continuous A&W losses, the company has tried to adopt new strategies to improve its bottom line, including selling its products through food trucks at petrol stations instead of traditional restaurant concept, and selling waffles at 7-Eleven convenience stores to expand its customer base. However, it still suffered an operating loss of 70 million baht in 2021. Glocon reported total sales of 1.86 billion baht in 2021, a 23% increase on 2020. ""The market of the quick-service restaurants is relatively high competition. In each location, our restaurants were surrounded by strong competitors both direct and indirect,'' the A&W sales representative said. Thailand's quick-service restaurant business was estimated to be worth 40-42 billion baht in 2021. A total of 45% of sales belonged to the fried chicken business, while the remainder stemmed from segments such as pizza and burgers. Thanks to stiff competition and a sharp decline in foreign tourist numbers, sales at some A&W branches have plunged to between 10,000-17,000 baht per day, compared to a peak of 30,000 baht in the period before the start of the pandemic. Rising costs of raw materials and energy, as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war, have exacerbated the firm's woes. In addition, the number of international tourists arriving, including from Russia under the Test & Go scheme, has continued to decline."

540,0,Deliveroo meets top growth forecast as dining in trend stays intact,414 words,Reuters News,"Deliveroo founder and Chief Executive Will Shu said the performance was ""really encouraging"", although he cautioned that the first quarter of 2022 would be the hardest comparison because many of its markets were in full lockdown in the first three months of 2021. He said the average order value of 21.40 pounds ($29.12) in the fourth quarter was down 5% year on year, reverting back to pre-COVID levels. However it was slightly up on the third quarter and the frequency of orders from its 8 million active monthly customers had increased to 3.4 per month, from 3.3 in the third quarter. ""We feel good about the consumer engagement side,"" he said in an interview. The company was also not struggling to recruit riders, he said, despite competing opportunities in other sectors because they valued the flexibility on offer.  Deliveroo, which competes with the likes of Uber Eats and Just Eat Takeaway, said it grew market share as it improved its customer offer, including more grocery options, which accounted for 8% of GTV in the second half of 2021. Shares in Deliveroo, which have lost more than half of their value since listing at 390 pence in March 2021, were trading up 2.6% at 174 pence on Thursday. The company, which has yet to make a profit even as demand has boomed, said it maintained its guidance for gross profit margin as a percentage of GTV at 7.5-7.75%. Shu said he would guide on 2022 when the company reports full-year results in March, and he would also talk about the longer-term path to profitability.

EBITDA Rises; Announces Cost Rationalization Program,309 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"Net loss from continuing operations was $389.06 million or $7.18 per share compared to a loss of $18.50 million or $0.34 per share. The company noted that the increase in net loss is due primarily to a current year charge of $229.0 million for the impairment of goodwill related to the Pharmacy Services Segment. Revenue increased to $6.07 billion from $5.92 billion, a year ago. Analysts on average had estimated $5.95 billion in revenue. For fiscal 2023, the company projects adjusted EBITDA to be between $460 million and $500 million. Adjusted net loss per share is expected to be between $0.53 and $1.06. Total revenues are projected to be between $23.1 billion and $23.5 billion in fiscal 2023.  Rite Aid said it will significantly reduce costs through closure of a total of 145 unprofitable stores, a reduction in corporate administrative expenses and improved efficiencies in worked payroll and other store labor costs. The company expects these cost initiatives to drive savings of $170 million in fiscal 2023."
964,1,Business activity growth in south west hits ten-month high in March,784 words,Bournemouth Echo,"The headline NatWest South West Business Activity Index ï¿½?a seasonally adjusted index that measures the month-on-month change in the combined output of the regionâs manufacturing and service sectors ï¿½?rose from 59.6 in February to 64.3 in March, to signal the sharpest increase in output since May 2021. The upturn was the joint-strongest seen of all 12 monitored UK regions (on a par with Yorkshire & Humber). The seasonally adjusted New Business Index pointed to a further improvement in overall new orders received by south west private sector firms in March. Furthermore, the rate of growth quickened for the third month in a row to reach the strongest since May 2021. Greater intakes of new business were often linked by panellists to stronger customer demand as the impact of the pandemic continued to fade. There were also mentions of new client wins. In contrast, new order intakes rose at a softer pace across the UK as a whole, and one that was slower than that seen in the south west. South west private sector businesses generally expect output to expand over the next year, but overall optimism softened in March. Notably, the level of positive sentiment slipped to a near two-year low and was weaker than the UK-wide trend. While many firms anticipate that activity will continue to recover due to the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions, there were concerns over rising costs, supply chain disruption and labour shortages. Latest survey data pointed to a sharp and accelerated rise in staffing levels at south west private sector firms at the end of the first quarter. Furthermore, the rate of job creation was the steepest seen since August 2021. Anecdotal evidence indicated that firms expanded their workforce numbers to meet rising customer demand and due to efforts to fill vacancies. On a regional basis, only London registered a faster increase in employment than that seen in the south west. Although the level of work-in-hand (but not yet completed) continued to rise across south west private sector companies in March, the rate of increase slowed for the second successive month. Moreover, the pace of accumulation was the slowest seen since the current period of expansion began a year ago and only marginal. Higher backlogs were often linked to rising sales, but some firms mentioned that higher staff numbers had helped to alleviate some pressure on capacity. Outstanding business meanwhile increased modestly across the UK as a whole in March, with the rate of growth also easing since February. Average input costs faced by private sector firms in the south west increased for the twenty-second month in a row in March. Notably, the rate of inflation was the joint-second strongest in the series history (beaten only by November 2021). The upturn was not quite as sharp as that seen at the national level, however. Panel members indicated a widespread increase in expenses, with energy, fuel, labour, transport and raw materials mentioned in particular. Adjusted for seasonal factors, the Prices Charged Index pointed to a sustained rise in output charges set by south west private sector companies in March. Furthermore, the rate of inflation was the sharpest seen since the series began in November 1999. Where higher selling prices were reported, companies often linked this to the pass-through of additional costs to customers. A record rise in output prices was also seen at the national level, and one that was quicker than that seen in the south west. Paul Edwards, chair ofNatWest South West Regional Board, said:âBusiness activity across the south west surged at the quickest rate for 10 months in March as the impact of the pandemic continued to fade and customer demand strengthened further. ""Notably, the south west, along with Yorkshire & Humber, posted the sharpest rise in output of all 12 UK regions at the end of the first quarter. ""The recovery was accompanied by further steep increases in costs, however, which led to a record upturn in selling prices. Rising expenses, supply chain disruption and labour shortages weighed on business confidence, which fell to a 23-month low."""

434,0,Developer aims to transform mall into mixed-use attraction: DEKALB COUNTY,567 words,The Atlanta Journal - Constitution,"The information was included in a Development of Regional Impact (DRI) application filed last week by Edens and Jim McKenney, the companyâs vice president of construction. These applications are necessary for gigantic projects that will affect an entire region ï¿½?not just the city or county where the project is located. The development project aims to feature 300,000 square feet of retail space, 200,000 square feet of office space and a 150-room hotel. The project vision also includes 1,700 multifamily apartment units and 100 townhomes. Edens representatives declined to comment about the redevelopment vision for the mall, which is just west of Clarkston and north of Decatur. North DeKalb Mall, which has several vacant storefronts, has become more well-known as a filming location than as a thriving retail center. The mallâs previous owner, Sterling Organization, put the property up for sale in May, and Edens acquired the property by September. Neither company divulged sale details. The DRI application is the first big announcement for the floundering mall since 2018, when Sterling filed similar rezoning paperwork as part of a vision to redesign the mall around a Costco, hotel and new housing units. Those plans were abandoned. DeKalb commissioners previously told the AJC that itâs important for a quality project to transform the mall, given its size and potential. âWe consider it to be a very important site in DeKalb,ï¿½?Commissioner Jeff Rader said last May. âItâs a very large tract of land that you donât usually get for development in an urban area like this.ï¿½?Other malls in metro Atlanta are having to pivot amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of e-commerce. North Point Mall in Alpharetta, which also changed management in 2021, is pursuing an open-air, mixed-use concept for the 44-acre shopping center. Its project would include dozens of townhomes, roughly 650 apartments, a 150-unit hotel and hundreds of thousands of square feet of office, medical, retail and restaurant space. Other metro Atlanta malls, including the Gallery at South DeKalb and The West End Mall, also changed hands last year and are ripe for redevelopment. In addition, Northlake Mall in Tucker is pivoting to an office-focused business model. Edensï¿½?website describes the firm as a retail real estate owner, operator and developer with a portfolio of more than 100 places. Among nine properties it lists in the Atlanta metro area are Buckhead Marketplace on West Paces Ferry Road, Toco Hills on North Druid Hills Road, Merchants Walk on Johnson Ferry Road in Marietta and Brookwood Village on Peachtree Road. The DRI application, which is now under the review and consideration of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs, estimates the project will be completed by 2028.

31,0,7shifts serves up success,1364 words,The Toronto Star,"After seeing how expensive it was to operate in the Bay Area, 7shifts founder and CEO Jordan Boesch converted their U.S. angel round into Canadian dollars and moved back north of the border to help the company ""refocus and buckle down and build products for restaurants."" Since 2014, when Boesch noticed how his dad struggled to organize shift schedules across the Quiznos franchises he managed, 7shifts has grown into a respected leader of software designed to simplify scheduling headaches. At a time when small restaurants are going bankrupt, 7shifts has decided to stick it out - and even reported substantial growth among restaurateurs. The Star spoke to Boesch about running a tech company headquartered in Saskatchewan, and a recent major investment by Japanese finance giant SoftBank: There's a lot of scheduling management tools on the market. Why did you think you could build a better one? Initially, we built 7shifts to be a horizontally focused scheduling tool. We had every industry using 7shifts - retail, restaurants, construction, even some folks in the medical field. What we found was that we were building a product that didn't make people really excited. We were a jack of all trades, master of none. In this world, where you can essentially order a shirt that's tailored exactly to your size online, we believed software should feel the same. Back in 2014, we made that prediction - and we feel it was the right one - and that operators would gravitate to a tool that's really catered to them. So we opted to go very deep into the restaurant business because we wanted to build a product that would resonate with restaurant operators specifically and get them really excited. Why focus on the restaurant industry? At the time, the restaurant industry lacked innovation. A lot of folks weren't really building for restaurants, especially independent ones, because a lot of people thought they just couldn't afford to pay for software. It was true, to a certain extent. Margins are really tight in restaurants. The number of people who were avoiding restaurants, from a technological innovation perspective, was huge. We thought there'd be a great opportunity to build for this segment that has been wildly underserved. It took us a few years to really get the momentum and to start building a restaurant product. But people were overwhelmed with joy. Restaurant communities are typically very small and intimate - word-of-mouth got around. How did you convince restaurant owners to pay for software at a time when they might be worried about keeping the lights on? For about six months, about one per cent of our customer base shut down either permanently or temporarily. It was a very challenging time for our customers - and the trickle-down effect is our business. We just offered our product for free for existing customers and for new customers that were onboarding. Our customer service team would talk to them, and if they were in a bit of a pinch and needed something, we'd offer them six months free or a large discount - just get them up and using the product. We found the long-term effects of someone using our product is that they typically stay. So, we wanted to just get our product into the hands of folks so they could manage through the pandemic and see the value in the tool - and then, if they decide they want to keep it and pay for it. And they did. 7shifts is promising to improve the happiness and efficiency of workers. Restaurant workers have long complained that they don't have stable working hours - that they're constantly being thrown all over the place. How do you juggle happiness with the efficiency needed to run a successful restaurant? The best thing we try and communicate to our operators as part of our offering is that it's important to get feedback from your staff on how they're enjoying their shifts. What I'm excited to see is that there's almost a shift in the balance of power. Short-term, there's a worker shortage, but I think that what we're seeing is that there are a lot of employers that are getting really creative in how they attract employees and how they retain them. It's becoming more about the flexibility of work, and it's becoming more about the pay and culture of restaurants. I think that, largely, it was an industry that almost had an excuse not to. It was more of a short-term, rotating door career. We're talking to a lot of operators right now that are trying to build career structures, especially for chefs and cooks. There's an overall shift in attitude toward workers. By and large, operators will need to balance the needs of their business with the flexibility of their workers. One is not more important than the other. They're both very important to running an efficient business. We're seeing a lot of sentiment change around the engagement of workers, and it is largely to do with the feedback that employers are asking from their staff and changing their behaviours accordingly. You're from Saskatchewan and, as far as I can tell, 7shifts is still based in Saskatchewan. Are you still there? I grew up in Saskatchewan and I've lived in Ottawa for a little while - I've moved to France with my wife - and moved to the Bay Area. We raised money in the Bay Area to build this company in Canada. We set up Saskatoon as our headquarters, but we've expanded - we have another office in Toronto and that city's office has as many people as our Saskatoon office now. We have a small office in New York, and we have some folks in Calgary, Vancouver, Atlanta, Michigan. COVID has really allowed us to hire the best people from anywhere. At the end of the day, we've always had a strong bias toward hiring great Canadians because we think that we have a really big opportunity to build a massive, impactful company and to really help Canada solidify its place on the map as a booming technology ecosystem. Do you ever see yourself moving your headquarters? Do you want to stay rooted in Saskatchewan? I don't see us jumping headquarters. I think we're going to be opening more satellite offices that are going to be flexible for if people want to come into the office or if they want to work from home. The more folks we bring into the same city, the more they start asking for the ability to meet up with their teams in a more formal way - whether it's a WeWork space or just a collaborative environment. So we want to be accommodating as we end up hiring more folks to meet the needs of how they want to work. 7shifts finished an $80 million funding round led by SoftBank's Vision Fund. What prompted SoftBank to say yes - and what do you intend to do with the money you've raised? I think we have a really compelling vision that aligns with how they think about their Vision Fund. We're excited to have SoftBank on board as a partner because they're more long-term investors - and we're not building a company for the short term. We're building a company that's going to be long-term and long-lasting and impactful. And so when we sat down to chat product with them and how we were going to go about executing our vision, it was very clear that there was strong alignment. This interview has been edited for length and clarity."

307,1,Legal eagles flying south to triple their salaries in London,575 words,The Times,"The removal of the final remaining pandemic restrictions has led to a scramble among firms to recruit staff to cope with the demand for lawyers. Firms in Scotland are struggling to hire new solicitors, with many opting to move to London, where similar shortages mean that they can earn up to three times more than the salaries being offered in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow. The Law Society of Scotland said that the trend would threaten access to justice, while others claimed that the inflated salaries and the gruelling schedules that accompany them would lead to young professionals burning out before they turn 30. ""There are fewer newly qualified solicitors now, just as the sector is looking for more people and as they are seeing increased competition from south of the border,"" Rob Marrs, the Law Society of Scotland head of education, said. ""We need to make sure that there are enough legal professionals now and into the future and with the right training and qualifications otherwise the Scottish public will find it harder to access the legal expertise they need at a reasonable price."" Marrs confirmed that there was a trend of young professionals being lured to the south of England. ""Some larger corporate firms have told us they're seeing more newly qualified people than in previous years heading to London for significantly larger salaries,"" he said. ""Not everyone can move south, nor does everyone want to sleep in their office (even for those salaries), but the issue of losing talent to London is a consistent one. We've heard of larger firms paying double-digit pay rises to try to retain staff, as the competition for qualified staff is incredibly fierce."" Marrs warned that there had been a particular ""exodus"" from the criminal justice sector, with many qualified lawyers moving to more lucrative sectors of the profession. Newly qualified solicitors working in firms in Scottish cities can expect to earn about Â£50,0000 a year, but working for multinational firms with bases in London can mean that young professionals earn double or even three times as much. Rupa Mooker, director of people and development with the law firm MacRoberts, which has offices in Glasgow and Edinburgh, said that the lure of London salaries was having an impact on recruitment, particularly when firms there were also offering remote or hybrid working. ""It's a nobrainer for candidates to accept a higher salary if they can do most of their job from Scotland,"" she said. British legal firms are facing intense competition for talent from US law companies expanding in Britain. This has led to newly qualified lawyers at leading London firms being offered salaries of Â£100,000 before bonuses. Dan Kayne, a senior lawyer with Network Rail, raised concerns about the trend. ""The eye-watering sums being paid to newly qualified lawyers is out of control Â£150,000 is simply way too much,"" he said. ""The level of expectation from client and firm will burn people out before they hit 30."""

883,1,PTA-Adhoc: CropEnergies AG: CropEnergies expects significant increase in earnings in 1st quarter - First outlook for the current financial year,766 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"Mannheim (pta026/14.04.2022/13:15) - CropEnergies AG, Mannheim, expects a significant increase in revenues, EBITDA and operating profit for the 1st quarter after an encouraging start into the 2022/23 financial year (1 March 2022 to 28 February 2023). In the same quarter of the previous year, CropEnergies had generated an EBITDA of EUR 25 million euros and an operating result of EUR 15 million euros on a revenue of EUR 214 million. As a result of an incipient weakening of the Corona pandemic, CropEnergies expects a normalisation of mobility behaviour in the course of the 2022/23 financial year. However, the impact of the Ukraine war on sales, energy and raw material markets is difficult to assess. CropEnergies assumes, from today's perspective, that sufficient energy and raw materials will be available for the production of food and animal feed products as well as renewable ethanol. Furthermore, it is expected that the EU member states will essentially maintain their blending targets for biofuels and that this will continue to lead to high capacity utilisation. In addition, CropEnergies assumes that higher energy and raw material costs can continue to be compensated by higher sales prices for ethanol as well as for food and animal feed products. Against this background, CropEnergies expects revenues of EUR 1.35 to EUR 1.45 (previous year: EUR 1.08) billion and an operating result of EUR 105 to EUR 155 (previous year: EUR 127) million for the 2022/23 financial year. This corresponds to an EBITDA of EUR 145 to EUR 195 (previous year: EUR 169) million. The full report for the 2021/22 financial year will be published on 18 May 2022. The statement on the 1st quarter of 2022/23 will be published on 6 July 2022.  CropEnergies AG  Sustainable, renewable products made from biomass - that is what CropEnergies stands for. Our products contribute to a climate-friendly world and ensure that fossil carbons remain in the ground permanently and do not continue to drive climate change. Founded in Mannheim in 2006, the member of the SÃ¼dzucker Group is the leading European producer of renewable ethanol. With a production capacity of 1.3 million m3 of ethanol per year, CropEnergies produces neutral alcohol as well as technical alcohol (ethanol) for a wide range of applications at locations in Germany, Belgium, the UK, and France: Sustainably produced ethanol as a petrol substitute is an answer to the future challenges of climate-friendly energy supply in the transport sector. Thanks to highly efficient production plants, our ethanol reduces CO2 emissions by an average of more than 70% across the entire value chain compared to fossil fuel. Our high-quality alcohol is also used in beverage production, cosmetics, pharmaceutical applications, for example as a basis for disinfectants, or as a raw material for innovative biochemicals. Equally important are the resulting protein food and animal feed products as a sustainable regional alternative to emission-intensive protein imports from overseas, as well as biogenic carbon dioxide. It is used in beverage production, among other things, and will be a valuable raw material for a wide range of applications in transport and industry in the future. Thus, all raw material components are utilised in our circular economy.  CropEnergies AG (ISIN DE000A0LAUP1) is listed on the regulated market (Prime Standard) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

319,1,Press Release: 2022 first quarter : Income increase by 55%,745 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"Q1 2022 revenues up +55% In thousands of euros 2022* 2021 % Variation --------------------------- ----- ---- ----------- Turnover Q1 1 342 865 + 55% --------------------------- ----- ---- ----------- Unaudited consolidated data In line with the last quarter of 2021, Spineway confirms its growth momentum and totals revenues of EUR1.3 million for the first quarter of 2022, up 55% compared to the year 2021. The latter benefits from the synergies implemented with Distimp, the growth of sales in France and positive commercial orientation in Latin America. Sales in Latin America showed strong growth of 31.1% compared to 2021 and represented 41.5% of Group sales (EUR558 k). Despite the continuing health crisis in the territory, the region is benefiting from a return to a more normalized situation in surgical activity, which has enabled the booking of significant orders. The significant growth in the Europe region, which doubled compared to Q1 2021 to reach EUR427 k, was mainly driven by sales in France, which now represent 26.2% of Group sales at EUR351 k in Q1 2022, following the successful integration of Distimp. Asia remained stable in Q1 2022 (EUR181 k), while the Middle East zone amounted to EUR176 k and increased significantly compared to Q1 2021, following the strengthening of the Group's presence in North Africa.

843,0,Neil Young-Spotify row underscores podcast disinformation issues,830 words,Agence France Presse,"Rogan, 54, has discouraged vaccination in young people and promoted the off-label use of the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin to treat the virus. ""I realized I could not continue to support SPOTIFY's life threatening misinformation to the music loving public,"" Young, a polio survivor, said in an open letter. His challenge followed a demand from hundreds of medical professionals that the streaming service prevent Rogan from promoting ""several falsehoods about Covid-19 vaccines,"" which they said is creating ""a sociological issue of devastating proportions."" Rogan, who has a $100 million multi-year exclusive deal with Spotify, was kept on. On Wednesday Young's hits -- including ""Heart of Gold,"" ""Harvest Moon"" and ""Rockin' In The Free World"" -- began vanishing from the platform. The company -- which on Wednesday voiced ""regret"" over Young's move but cited a need to balance ""both safety for listeners and freedom for creators"" -- did not respond to an AFP query seeking further comment. Last year, its CEO Daniel Ek told Axios he didn't think Spotify -- which recently began heavily investing in podcasts -- had editorial responsibility for Rogan. He compared the podcaster to ""really well-paid rappers,"" saying ""we don't dictate what they're putting in their songs, either."" Spotify's move drew applause online from organizations including Rumble, a video streaming platform popular with the right wing, which credited the Swedish company with ""defending creators"" and standing ""up for free speech."" But Young, 76, also garnered wide praise for taking a stand, including from the World Health Organization chief. The musician has urged fellow artists to follow his lead. Summer Lopez, the senior director of the free expression programs at nonprofit PEN America, emphasized that ""he's probably one of the only artists who could really afford to make this kind of call."" ""He has every right to do that,"" said the advocate at PEN, an organization dedicated to defending free speech. But she voiced concern over ""broader calls for boycotting of Spotify,"" because ""it is such an essential venue for artists to reach their audiences, and a source of income."" The role of platforms like Spotify to moderate content is complex, Lopez said, because unlike social media outlets it's a service ""designed primarily to amplify art and artwork."" ""I think the real issue here is that Spotify doesn't have a clear policy on this,"" Lopez said. And she raised questions of whether ""there's any meaningful independence"" between ""the decision-making process and their business concerns."" In recent years online media titans including Facebook and YouTube have come under fire for allowing conspiracy theorists to spread their views. But despite its explosive growth, podcasting has largely flown under the radar. Valerie Wirtschafter, a senior data analyst at the Brookings Institution who studies contemporary media and political behavior, said that's primarily because ""it's such a big and decentralized space."" But she said audio is a particularly potent medium for spreading falsehoods: ""There's a sort of personal experience that happens there."" The intimacy of sound combined with the conversational style of podcasts, Wirtschafter told AFP, allows listeners to process information in a way that ""potentially makes it a stronger medium for these untruths, for this misinformation, to fester."" And tracking disinformation in a podcast is ""kind of like the needle in the haystack,"" according to Wirtschafter. Episodes of ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" often fall in the two-to-three-hour range. Moderation possibilities include disclaimers before episodes, Wirtschafter said, and platforms that host podcasts could also take steps to mediate their algorithms so they aren't ""amplifying... harmful content."" Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist specializing in conspiracy theories at the University of Miami, meanwhile cautioned against giving any ""tools of censorship"" to government to combat disinformation. ""They can be used for benevolent reasons today, but those same tools will be available tomorrow for people who aren't quite as benevolent."" Lopez agreed, but cited a need for ""mandating more clarity on how these decisions are being made, how appeals are handled."" ""Giving researchers access to understand what the implications of those decisions are,"" she said, could help ""better understand what the impact of different approaches might be."" For his part, Young dismissed accusations of promoting censorship. ""I did this because I had no choice in my heart,"" he wrote. ""It is who I am. I am not censoring anyone."" ""I am speaking my own truth."" mdo/caw"

152,0,Cruise ship plan will let WAGs hit the bar,401 words,The Times,"The ship will be docked close to Doha, offering a higher standard of accommodation and the added bonus of guests being able to comfortably drink alcohol on board. The rules around drinking are expected to be slightly relaxed during the tournament, with organisers working on a deal to make alcohol easier to buy. The partners of England players Harry Kane, Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling are among those who have chosen to stay on the cruise ship, according to the Daily Mail. The behaviour of England players' wives and girlfriends during tournaments has proved a distraction in the past, in particular at the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Reports of drunk dancing on tables and huge hotel bills in the town of Baden-Baden emerged from the camp during that tournament, in which England reached the quarter-finals. Four years later Fabio Capello, the England manager, banned partners from travelling to the World Cup in South Africa. Not long afterwards, Gary Neville, who has 85 England caps, was confidently predicting that there was little danger of a repeat of such distracting behaviour at other tournaments. ""The FA learnt from the experience in 2006. The England team did. The England players did. That wasn't ideal for anybody,"" he told Metro. ""It was symptomatic of the times. It is a different world now and those mistakes won't happen again."""

883,0,Govt blocks 35 Pak-based YouTube channels for fake news,504 words,Deccan Herald,"Information and Broadcasting Secretary Apurva Chandra told a press conference that the action was taken by invoking the emergency provisions of the law after receiving inputs from the intelligence agencies on Friday about the channels and social media accounts. The blocked YouTube channels cumulatively had a subscriber base of 1.2 crore and video views running into 130 crore. The Ministry issued orders under Rule 16 of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. Also read: Covid-19 related data of thousands of Indians leaked online[https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-related-data-of-thousands-of-indians-leaked-online-1073265.html]  In December, 20 YouTube channels and two websites were similarly blocked when the emergency powers under the IT Rules, 2021 were first used to act against such networks. Last time, Chandra said, the intermediaries had blocked access to these platforms worldwide and they do expect the same this time too, though the Ministry's order is specific to India. Information and Broadcasting Joint Secretary Vikram Sahai said the 35 accounts blocked by the Ministry were identified to be part of four coordinated disinformation networks, which included Apni Duniya Network operating 14 YouTube channels, and Talha Films Network operating 13 YouTube channels. A set of four channels, and a set of two other channels were also found to be acting in synchronisation with each other. All these networks appeared to be operated with a ""single goal of spreading fake news oriented towards the Indian audience"" and used common hashtags and editing styles, were being operated by common persons, and cross promoted each otherâs content. ""Some of the YouTube channels were being operated by anchors of Pakistani TV news channels,"" he said. Sahay said the topics handled by the blocked channels were on Indian Army, Jammu and Kashmir and Indiaâs foreign relations with other countries. At the press conference, some of the content used by the blocked channels were shown, which included accusations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval for the death of Gen Bipin Rawat in a chopper crash and North Korean army reaching Ladakh to help the Chinese army among others. ""The channels propagated content to encourage separatism, divide India on the lines of religion, and create animosity among the various sections of the Indian society. Such information were feared to have the potential to incite the audience into commission of crimes adversely affecting public order in the country,"" Chandra said. He said it should also be the responsibility of intermediaries like YouTube to take into account these ""totally toxic"" content and should have a system to flag such content.

985,1,"$50b state budget adds services, skips cuts",1240 words,The Boston Globe,"That includes a proposed $110 million to extend a free school meals initiative currently covered by an expiring federal program; tens of millions more dollars to bolster child-care worker salaries; and $20 million to cover a new proposal requiring all jails and prisons make phone calls free for prisoners and their families, something only one other state currently mandates. âWe chose to use the opportunities that we have here to make investments into the middle class that we feel were extremely necessary, to stabilize the economy while the economy is doing relatively well from a revenue standpoint,"" said state Representative Aaron Michlewitz, the House budget chairman and a North End Democrat. State coffers are currently flush with cash. Revenues for the fiscal year ending in June are trending $1.5 billion above projections, and the state still has more than $2 billion in federal stimulus aid at its disposal. Its emergency savings account is also expected to reach a record $5.76 billion by the summer, and under the House's plan, would grow further by hundreds of millions more. But the chamber, for now, is not seeking to ease residents' own tax burden. House Speaker Ronald Mariano said the budget does not include any of the $700 million in tax breaks Baker proposed in an effort to âgive back"" to residents who were shouldering rising costs. Mariano on Wednesday left the door open to considering tax relief proposals later in the Legislature's formal session, which ends on July 31, citing the state's potential budget surplus. But when or in what form that could emerge is unclear. âWe felt they weren't necessary at the time. We have money, we have a surplus,"" Mariano said, arguing that lawmakers face demands to put the money to work elsewhere. He cited a legislative commission's study of the state's early-education system that estimated it would cost $1.5 billion annually to put a raft of recommendations into place. âThere are many things that we can spend our money on, and we chose to do that,"" he said. âThese programs in early childhood and [the state's] daycare support system are the underpinning of our middle and lower class workforce."" Baker's tax break plan, which he filed separate from but simultaneously with his budget proposal, included raising the income threshold for residents to qualify for âno-tax status"" and doubling a pair of refundable tax credits people can claim for dependents or child care. He also is seeking dramatic changes to the Massachusetts estate tax by doubling the tax threshold to $2 million, and taxing only those dollars above it. Mariano said last month that House leaders have also been discussing potential changes to the estate tax. âAs inflation continues to rip around here . . . we should do these,"" Baker told reporters Tuesday before the House released its plan. âThis is exactly when you should do it."" Eileen P. McAnneny, president of the business-backed Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, said Wednesday that the state's financial picture can support both increasing spending and easing the tax burden. âMy hope and expectation is that they'll do [a tax relief bill] separately,"" she said of lawmakers. The House is expected to debate its budget proposal later this month, when more spending is likely to be added. The Senate will then release its own spending plan next month, and lawmakers will have to reconcile the differences before sending it to Baker's desk. Among the governor's options: signing it, suggesting changes, or vetoing some or all of it. The House's initial budget plan includes other large pockets of spending. It dedicates nearly $500 million more to direct local school aid, largely matching what Baker proposed. It pushes total spending there to nearly $6 billion in an effort to keep pace with the sweeping changes to the school funding formula the Legislature passed in 2019. It also carves out $18.4 billion for the state's Medicaid program, which exceeded Baker's proposal but is driven largely by the federal government's extension of the COVID-19 public health emergency. House leaders said they're also seeking to lift criminal justice efforts with new policies and financial support. They embraced a Baker proposal to end the monthly fees Massachusetts charges those on probation and parole. Their budget plan would also make Massachusetts the second state, following Connecticut, to require âno cost calls"" for jail and prison inmates and their families, who currently pay more than $14 million a year, House officials said. To supplement funds jails and prisons would lose from collecting those fees, the House is also seeking to create a separate trust fund, seeded with $20 million. Suffolk County Sheriff Steven Tompkins, who serves as president of the Massachusetts Sheriffs' Association, said he supports efforts to make the calls free; most, if not all, sheriffs currently charge 14 cents a minute, he said. But âat first blush,"" he said, he doesn't believe the $20 million would be enough, including to cover the portion of what departments collect to help fund inmate programs. âI think this is a start."" he said. âMoms and grandmoms are paying for these calls. Who wants to tax moms and grandmoms? I certainly don't. But we also have to make sure the system works."" House leaders said they are mindful of the impact rising inflation is having on the state. Prices in March rose 8.5 percent compared with a year ago, making it the largest annual increase in more than 40 years. Mariano argued that, too, cuts into any increases lawmakers seek for state programs and entities. âIt shrinks the rate of expansion,"" he said. The squeeze it has put on consumers, combined with rising gas prices, prompted GOP lawmakers to seek to suspend the state's gas tax in recent weeks. House and Senate Democrats both rejected those proposals, arguing, in part, that it could have wider financial ramifications for the state's ability to borrow money for road projects. S&P Global Ratings said on Tuesday that the temporary state gas tax suspensions being passed or considered by several states âare unlikely to lead to rating changes on highway user tax-supported debt."" But Mariano said he wasn't convinced, and indicated he would oppose suspending the gas tax should it surface again in the chamber's budget debate. âI thought it was a very bizarre statement for a bond rating agency to make,"" said Mariano, pointing specifically to the use of the word âunlikely.""

333,1,Firms offer 25pc pay rises to secure staff amid shortages,396 words,The Daily Telegraph,"He said there is a shortage of skills worldwide as firms embark on a hiring spree across economies emerging from the pandemic.Technology specialists are among the most in demand due to a push for digital transformations worldwide, according to Hays. Mr Venables said it was ""absolutely the strongest"" market he has seen during his time at the group and likely for decades. ""It's the highest permanent recruitment market in my 16 years with Hays and the highest wage inflation I've seen,"" he said.  Hays hailed a record performance at the start of 2022 due to the hot jobs market, but revealed a hit of around Â£5m after pulling out of Russia. The group posted a 32pc surge in like-for-like fees over its third quarter to the end of March, with record-breaking results across 19 countries and its highest ever monthly fees in March. Fees in the UK and Ireland rose 29pc, it added. Hays said the closure early last month of its offices in Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine will result in about Â£5m in one-off costs. The sites in Moscow and St Petersburg - which employed 245 staff - accounted in half-year results for about Â£5.9m in group fees and about 1pc, or Â£800,000, of company earnings. Full-year guidance remains for operating profits of Â£210m to Â£215m, excluding the Russia hit. Official figures earlier this week confirmed the UK jobs market remains solid, with the rate of unemployment falling to 3.8pc - the lowest since December 2019. But there were signs of easing demand, with the smallest monthly increase in payrolled workers since February 2021 and vacancy growth also slowing. Mr Venables said that in the white collar sector he was ""not seeing any signs of things cooling off "". 3.8pc Unemployment rate in the UK, the lowest level since December 2019, according to official data released earlier this week"
608,0,New Dutch government expected to ease month-long COVID-19 lockdown,320 words,Reuters News,"Rutte, whose cabinet was installed on Monday, is due to make a televised address to the nation at 1800 GMT. His caretaker government ordered the lockdown in mid-December as a wave of the Delta variant forced the health system to cancel all but the most urgent care and it appeared rising Omicron cases would overwhelm it. Infections have continued to rise despite the lockdown, which bans all public gatherings, with a record of more than 200,000 in the week through Jan. 11, according to the Netherlands Institute for Health (RIVM). But hospitalizations declined slightly. A poll by Hart van Nederland published on Friday found that 89% of people supported reopening stores and a majority support reopening restaurants and cultural institutions. More than 86% of Dutch adults are fully vaccinated and nearly 50% received a booster shot during a major campaign during the lockdown. Among other changes to policy expected on Friday, the incoming Health Minister Ernst Kuipers is expected to shorten the period during which people exposed to, but not infected with, the virus are obliged to quarantine. Primary schools have been open since Jan. 10 after a longer-than-planned closure for winter holidays, but classes are frequently dismissed after students or teachers are exposed. Kuipers may also seek to expand the use of face masks. Adherence to rules, such as wearing them in grocery stores, is patchy. (Editing by Janet Lawrence)"
832,1,DGAP-Adhoc: SÃ¼dzucker expects significant earnings increase in the first quarter of the current 2022/23 financial year,752 words,Dow Jones Newswires German,"Positive initial outlook for full fiscal 2022/23 despite Ukraine war After a very positive start to fiscal 2022/23, SÃ¼dzucker AG expects EBITDA and operating result for the first quarter of fiscal 2022/23 (1 March to 31 May 2022) to be significantly higher than last year's levels (Q1 2021/22: EBITDA: EUR 121 million; operating result: EUR 49 million). For fiscal 2022/23 as a whole, SÃ¼dzucker expects group revenues of EUR 8.7 to 9.1 (2021/22 year: 7.6) billion. We see EBITDA in a range of EUR 660 to 760 (2021/22: 692) million and consolidated operating result in a range of EUR 300 to 400 (2021/22: 332) million. The war in Ukraine, which has been ongoing since the beginning of the 2022/23 financial year, has further intensified the already high volatility on the sales markets and price increases on the procurement markets. The resulting economic and financial impact and the duration of this temporary exceptional situation, in addition to the Corona pandemic, are difficult to assess. In addition, the risks associated with the Corona pandemic continue to exist. The forecast for the first quarter and the full year is based on the assumption that the Ukraine war will remain temporary and regionally limited, that the physical supply of energy and raw materials is guaranteed and that the sales and procurement markets will partially normalize during fiscal 2022/23. In this context, SÃ¼dzucker's expected transfer of the significantly higher prices, especially in the raw material and energy sectors, into new customer contracts will be of decisive importance. The annual report for fiscal 2021/22 - including detailed forecast for fiscal 2022/23 - will be published on 19 May 2022, and the quarterly report for the first quarter of fiscal 2022/23 on 7 July 2022.

The faces of the women have been blurred to protect their identify (Apple TV Plus, Jin Ha's Tumblr blog) Jin Ha deleted his Instagram and Twitter accounts after the controversy over his blog (Screenshots from Instagram and Twitter) ""Pachinko"" was released on Apple TV Plus on March 25 and in the drama, Jin Ha plays the role of Solomon Baek, the grandson of Sunja (played by Oscar best supporting actress Youn Yuh-jung). But on the day the drama was released, a Korean netizen accused Jin Ha of illegal photography and sexual harassment through his Tumblr blog ""Korean Flowers in Bloom."" Jin Ha uploaded about 100 photos of elderly Korean women in subways taken without their consent and knowledge. The contents of the blog were published from July 2010 to September 2011. On his personal website, Jin Ha wrote that ""Korean Flowers in Bloom"" is ""a photography blog I created back in 2011 while I was living in South Korea. Please enjoy responsibly.""

""Korean-American actor Jin Ha, who appeared in 'Pachinko,' uploaded illegally filmed photos of Korean grandmothers on his portfolio website.

The netizen cited two posts from Jin Ha's blog as sexual harassment against the elderly Korean women. One is a post dated Aug. 16, 2010 in which Jin Ha uploaded a photo of a sleeping grandmother and wrote, ""Working with such a provocative model, I found it hard to keep myself and my concupiscence under control."" Another is a post dated Aug. 9, 2010 in which Jin Ha uploaded a photo of a woman wearing a blouse with large floral prints and wrote, ""Now we have an excuse to stare directly at her right nipple."" ""Illegal filming is also a problem, and it is very unpleasant to write down what you feel as if you were criticizing grandmothers.

Thank you for this opportunity to address a failing in my past that was long overdue,"" Jin Ha wrote. He said, ""You are absolutely right.

I deeply regret my actions. and apologize for them."" ""I was wrong to take these photos 11 years ago, and was wrong to post them online.

I apologize, as well, to the viewers whom I offended with this Tumblr account. My lack of judgement in 2011 has been pointed out by readers wiser than I have proved to be and for that I am grateful,"" he said. Jin Ha added, ""Thank you again for granting me this chance to rectify this blunder of a blog and for bringing it to my attention when it should have been clear to me from the beginning. I will work diligently to learn from this mistake so that I may never repeat it going forward."" South Korea's law ""Act On Special Cases Concerning The Punishment, Etc. of Sexual Crimes"" states that ""a person who takes photographs or videos of another person's body, which may cause any sexual stimulus or shame against the will of the person who was shot, by using a camera or other mechanism which has functions similar thereto, shall be punished by imprisonment with labor for not more than seven years or by a fine not exceeding 50 million won [$40,800],"" according to a copy of the law posted on the Korean Law Information Center website.
