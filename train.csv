Out of fear, the youngsters did not put up resistance. The duo contacted their family members and called up cops,ï¿½?the SHO added. The miscreants also took away Rs 4,000 and Namanâs mobile phone. Asked about if victims would be taken to task for violating orders regarding the night curfew, the SI said, âActually, there was some confusion over the timing of restaurants in the city on Friday. Some orders were mistakenly issued that the restaurants may open till 11.30pm which also got circulated and also found mention in a section of media. So the victims were in the impression that the restaurants would be open. However, when they found restaurants in Sarabha Nagar closed, they ordered food online.âOn the suspicion of the involvement of the food delivery boy, the official said nothing of that sort has been found in the initial probe.

577,0,Customers line up for Blondie's final burgers,391 words,The Toronto Star,"""It's just insanely crazy,"" Doyle's message continues. ""If you want to come down and take your chances."" Take a chance they did. Five minutes after the 36-seat eatery opened at 4 p.m., 14 people were waiting inside the restaurant well-known for extra-large offerings - like a nine-pound burger or one-litre milkshake - to pick up their meals. The wait, though, was already rated at two hours. Doyle and her friend Kim, who was working the counter, were handing out tickets and took advance orders so would-be customers didn't have to wait on the street in the cold wind. Customers like John Nicolas, 48, who was picking up two one-pound burgers and the fries for six for his family of five. He first went to Blondie's with his baseball team about 25 years ago for the novelty of it. ""We came with the idea (pairs of us) were going to split the three-pound burger - that much meat, I thought, an amazing thing. We split the three-pound burgers, each of us, and one guy shouted out, 'Hey, anybody up for another half?'"" he said. ""That day I had a three-pound burger and just thought, this is incredible, the novelty of that much meat was just amazing."" He came occasionally in the years since, but not regularly. ""I found out (Saturday) that my wife's never been - she grew up in the neighbourhood - I said, 'It's the last day, we'll get Blondie's,'"" Nicolas said. ""It's unfortunate it's not going to be around any longer."" Meanwhile, Doyle was cheerful and cheeky while working the kitchen she's made a living with since 1990 on Saturday, though she said it was a ""real mess"" in there. Besides, she asked a Free Press reporter, with a wry smile: ""Aren't people sick of me yet?"" erik.pindera@freepress.mb.ca"
885,1,Increased tax revenue mop-up keeps India on track to becoming $5 trn economy: FinMin,450 words,Press Trust of India,"""The central government's focus on making India a global economic powerhouse and the host of measures adopted towards this commitment has directly reflected in India's GDP growth in recent years. ""This has translated into increased revenue collection for the exchequer while keeping India well on the track towards achieving a USD 5 trillion economy...,"" the ministry said in a statement. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019 envisioned making India a USD 5 trillion economy and a global economic powerhouse. The Indian GDP is estimated to be around USD 3 trillion in 2021-22. The ministry said apart from a brief setback owing to COVID-19, the government has maintained the nominal GDP growth above 10 per cent in recent years. GST, a simplified way of collecting indirect taxes, has been a revolutionary step propelling Indiaâs GDP. ""With a big push to capex in the Union Budget of 2022-23, the coming years are going to see a surge in domestic manufacturing as well as growth in employment. These in turn will directly boost tax contribution to the exchequer,"" the ministry said. The gross corporate taxes during 2021-22 was Rs 8.6 lakh crore against Rs 6.5 lakh crore in the previous year. This, the ministry said, shows that the new simplified tax regime with low rates and no exemptions has lived up to its promise, enhancing Ease of Doing Business for the corporate sector, stimulating India's economy and increasing tax revenues for the government. In the last fiscal year, direct tax collection rose by a record 49 per cent to Rs 14.10 lakh crore, while indirect taxes recorded a growth of 20 per cent to Rs 12.90 lakh crore-- reflecting buoyancy in economy and the impact of anti-tax evasion measures. For the current fiscal year, capital expenditure (capex) is budgeted to rise by 35.4 per cent to Rs 7.5 lakh crore to continue the public investment-led recovery of the pandemic-battered economy. The capex last year was pegged at Rs 5.5 lakh crore. PTI JD ANU ANU"

Monika grew up in Chelm and first became pregnant at 22, while at university. She never considered an abortion. âI thought then that it would be my sin, and a crime, and murder,ï¿½?she says. Monika graduated two years later with a masterâs degree and two babies. Abortion was not discussed in the city, neither publicly nor in hushed tones among young women, according to Monika, save for high school screenings of the discredited 1980s anti-abortion film The Silent Scream[https://en-wikipedia-org.proxy.library.nyu.edu/wiki/The_Silent_Scream]. âIf anyone ever mentioned it,ï¿½?Monika says, âit was along the lines of, âI would never do it.ï¿½?It was something that people did out there in the big world, in these progressive, leftist countries. Not here.ï¿½?After her third daughter was born three years ago, Monika approached her gynaecologist to fit her with an intrauterine device (IUD). Her children were all born by caesarean section, a procedure that places the woman under increased risk each time it is performed. With her third pregnancy, Monika felt âwe were cutting it too close. A fourth could end badly for me.ï¿½?She was tired of the side-effects from the pill and, because contraception is not publicly funded in Poland, the monthly prescriptions were a financial problem. The doctor misled her, saying she could only get an IUD privately. âThat costs 1,500zl to 2,000 zl (Â£300 ï¿½?Â£400). I didnât have that type of money,ï¿½?Monika says. She tried other doctors but was told the same thing each time. In October 2020, when the wave of protests against the near-total ban on abortion[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/24/thousands-join-poland-protests-against-strict-abortion-laws] ï¿½?the largest demonstrations since the fall of communism ï¿½?reached Chelm, Monika didnât join the women on the streets. She was busy and needed to pick up her toddler from the nursery. ââLet others worry about it, the ones who still want to have children and who might end up in hospital with problems,ï¿½?I thought. I was safe, I didnât have to comment,ï¿½?Monika recalls. But as the protests raged[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/27/poland-to-implement-near-total-ban-on-abortion-imminently] on into 2021, she began thinking about abortion more often. âI think I read Aborcyjny [abortion] Dream Teamâs[https://aborcyjnydreamteam.pl/] entire website and a lot of advice books, and I came to the conclusion that it isnât anything bad. Itâs not hurting or killing anyone,ï¿½?Monika says. Then, in September 2021, Monika was faced with that reality when she became pregnant for a fourth time. She immediately went online and found a safe way to get abortion pills sent to her home. A week later a cardboard package from the Netherlands arrived in her postbox. âI was so happy when I saw it. I started crying with joy,ï¿½?she says. She took the pills on a Saturday after work ï¿½?two between her gum and cheek on either side. Her older daughters were at a birthday party, the youngest was watching cartoons. The whole process lasted five hours, by 11pm Monika was showered and asleep. Legal risks were not on her mind. While aiding someone in an abortion in Poland risks a prison sentence of up to three years, inducing your own miscarriage is not illegal until the 22nd week of pregnancy. Over the last 30 years, few people have faced court cases on abortion-related charges, but many more have been questioned by the police. Monika does not regret her abortion but says the experience has changed her. She has started sharing her story with friends, to mixed response, and recently signed her eldest daughter out of religious classes in school, despite teachersï¿½?protests. âI admit, I used to judge people,ï¿½?she says. âAfterwards, I was reading the testimonies of other people online and I thought, âOh God, how stupid I was.ï¿½?There are so many of us[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/oct/22/more-than-30000-polish-women-sought-or-foreign-abortions-since-law-change-last-year] ï¿½?one in three.

28,0,COVID reveals the weakness of China's authoritarianism,1152 words,The Boston Globe,"This is life in much of China at the moment. Rather than relying on mass vaccinations to get the country through its Omicron outbreak, the government is sticking with its âzero-COVID"" approach. This strategy appears to have resulted in fewer than 5,000 COVID-19 deaths in China, while the United States has seen close to 1 million deaths in a nation one-fourth the size. It is easy to see why some people would find zero COVID admirable. But keeping the policy going at this point requires steps that seem unsustainably invasive and stifling ï¿½?both socially and economically ï¿½?and amount to an admission that China's vaccines do not work as well as Western ones do. Omicron has put China between a rock and a hard place. The variant's high transmissibility ensures that the costs of the zero-COVID approach will grow, because more and more lockdowns will be needed to keep the virus at bay. But despite the economic toll, Chinese President Xi Jinping has shown no indication of backing down from his policy. Having spent two years painting himself as the leader who beat COVID-19, he knows that any relaxation and subsequent spike in cases and deaths would spoil that image. Xi's paralysis should be expected from a ruler who has replaced China's top-level collectivism with personalism, creating a regime in which there are few constraints on his authority. These are the predicaments of a strongman. Beijing is likely, then, to keep going with strict lockdowns not because zero COVID is necessarily the ideal policy but because Xi sees no way out that has risks low enough to be acceptable to him ï¿½?because he would own the policy in failure just as he did in success. China is currently facing what is by far its worst COVID-19 surge since the initial Wuhan outbreak, recording thousands of cases per day, even though about 85 percent of Chinese have been fully vaccinated against the virus. In recent weeks, Shenzhen, a hugely important manufacturing city near Hong Kong, has been in full lockdown. So, too, has Jilin Province. Shanghai has already closed its schools and businesses, while numerous compounds across Beijing and Tianjin have shut down as well. Over the last few weeks, some 51 million people have been locked down across China. Chinese officials are trying more consciously than before to mitigate the negative economic impact of zero COVID. Xi has urged officials to take what Chinese state television called more âeffective"" measures that minimize âthe impact of the epidemic on economic development."" Therefore, authorities are no longer sending all asymptomatic individuals to hospitals but instead to centralized quarantine facilities, which the government is erecting in hard-hit areas. Officials have also modified their approach toward Shenzhen, which is a particularly important link in the global supply chain, producing key items like semiconductors and circuit boards. Manufacturing is allowed to continue there while the city is locked down, essentially implementing the bubble concept that was used for the Beijing Olympics. But even though China has shown a bit of flexibility, Beijing will still lean toward a fundamentally hardline approach. Xi said as much on March 17, when state media reported him as declaring that China will âstick with"" its zero-COVID strategy. The truth is that Xi has not yet found an acceptable alternative. And why does he have no alternative? Because China's vaccines do not work as well as Western ones do ï¿½?as the World Health Organization has reported and as even Chinese officials have admitted. China's vaccines are not made with the mRNA technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna shots that have largely prevented death and severe illness throughout the Omicron wave in the United States and other countries. So if China opens up, the health care system could be flooded with symptomatic patients. And China's health care system is so unprepared for epidemic-type spread that any major shift from zero COVID would risk a public health crisis, with hospitalization and fatality numbers in some locations perhaps resembling those of pre-vaccine New York City or Italy or the recent situation in Hong Kong. The result, as many have pointed out, would be to undermine public confidence in the ruling Communist Party, whose official rhetoric has recently leaned heavily on the country's success in avoiding the chaos COVID-19 has wrought just about everywhere else. For a personalized regime like that of Xi, experiencing such chaos after holding it off for so long would be hard to swallow. This is a key downside of centralized power: When you appear to control everything, anything that goes wrong is inevitably your fault. Finding a believable scapegoat is difficult when you claim to exercise supreme authority. And pivoting to what appears like a reasonable solution ï¿½?procuring and rolling out Western-made vaccines ï¿½?might be too stark an about-face for a leader who has taken such a nationalistic and anti-Western line and whose state media has declared these vaccines worse than those made in China. Xi is not at risk of losing power. Beijing's leadership has banked credibility from decades of economic success and maintains considerable control over society and public discourse. But Xi has backed himself into a corner. He is facing an unrelenting strain of COVID-19, economic headwinds, and now, of course, Russia's war in Ukraine, which has the West threatening to impose severe sanctions on China at an inopportune moment. His regime may not be flexible enough to find a good way out. China's struggle to change direction at this critical moment is a painful reminder of autocracy's flaws. Indeed, it is hard for the Chinese system to reverse policies once they are well established precisely because decisions are made in a top-down and unified manner, without feedback loops and the local policy freedoms that can facilitate more incremental change. Those who believe autocracy produces better governance ï¿½?as more than a few observers argued when China and other one-party states initially controlled COVID-19 ï¿½?would do well to remember that China is struggling to develop a long-term plan for handling the pandemic not despite being an autocracy but because of it.

When the tree was initially cut down, sections of it were distributed across the city. The hotel building had been vacant for 30 years or so, according to Dave Wedge, a spokesman for the city of Brockton. The Liberty Tree was cut down in 2004 after the city brought in arborists to assess its condition, Wedge said. The arborists determined that the tree, which had grown to be 4 feet in diameter and was at risk of falling, was diseased and needed to be cut down. Before its removal from what is now Frederick Douglass Avenue, the Liberty Tree stood outside what were once the High Street stables of hotel keeper Edward E. Bennett, an outspoken abolitionist who hid people escaping enslavement in his barn, the Globe reported in 2013. Over time, the tree ï¿½?which some date to 1655 and others to 1800 ï¿½?was a gathering place for orators, from William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass in the pre-Civil War quest for freedom, to Lucy Stone and Lucretia Mott, who championed a woman's right to vote, the Globe reported. âMassachusetts as a whole played a huge role in the emancipation process and this [tree] is living proof of that,"" Wedge said. The tree had been moved to the hotel basement for storage prior to its discovery by Sullivan, Wedge said. Now, the remaining pieces of the tree are stored at the city's highway department, in the bed of a truck. Sullivan has also given blocks of wood to several high schools in the area in honor of Black History Month, Wedge said. The city has dubbed it the âLiberty Tree Tour"" on Twitter. Wedge said the âtour"" was prompted by Sullivan's desire to recognize the contributions of the city's Black community. âThe Mayor was surprised when he found it, and he immediately knew he had to do something to make sure it doesn't get destroyed,"" Wedge said. âHe wanted to make sure it wasn't lost to the annals of history.""

551,0,Star Casino Covid claims rejected,411 words,The Australian - Online,"The Star had sought to claim for hundreds of thousands of dollars of open drinks that were ruined by the long months of shutdown, and food which was left to rot as punters were kept away. The decision on Wednesday by Chief Justice Allsop comes after the Federal Court had earlier knocked back much of the Starâs claim against its insurer for losses suffered by the shutdown. In August, Chief Justice Allsop found The Star was not able to make a claim against its insurers as it lacked cover for losses arising from the pandemic. However, The Star has appealed that loss, with its case taken up as part of a bundle of business interruption test cases that were heard before the full bench of the Federal Court in November last year. But delays in the full bench of the Federal Court handing down its judgment in the widely anticipated insurance case saw Chief Justice Allsop issue his order. âI anticipated a decision of the Full Court by the end of 2021 within the context of which to finalise these reasons,ï¿½?he said in his judgment. âI considered that such decision might conceivably affect the reasoning for the spoilage claim. In the light of the Full Courtâs decision not being handed down in December 2021, I think it is appropriate that I finalise the claims in this proceeding by dealing with this last part of the proceeding.ï¿½?The loss by The Star is another win for the insurance industry, which was handed the victory in the first round of the bundle test cases heard before justice Jayne Jagot last year. Berrill and Watson principal John Berrill said the outcome of The Starâs claims around spoilage was âa side issueï¿½? but the decision of the full court on the larger business interruption insurance case was of significance. âItâs going to affect the rights of thousands of businesses small and large following huge losses from Covid dating back to March 2020,ï¿½?he said."
513,1,Eight fertilizers with which to germinate your crops in bags,864 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"Following the analogy, a good investment opportunity would be to buy the shares of fertilizer and pesticide manufacturers rather than the shares of food producers and distributors. If you had thought of this at the beginning of the year and put a firm like US-based Mosaic in your portfolio, you would have gained 91% on the stock market since then. For those of the New York-listed Sociedad QuÃ­mica y Minera de Chile, you would have made a 68% return this year; 54% for CF Industries or 45% for Canada's Nutrien. Overall, the S&P 500 Fertilizers & Agricultural Chemicals index, which groups together the four major US producers: Mosaic, CF Industries, FMC and Corteva, has gained almost 45% since January. Although commodity prices have been rising for months now, the war in Ukraine has also contributed. ""As big as Russia is in oil, it is more decisive for world fertilizer markets. Farmers around the world depend on fertilizers derived from three different natural resources: potash, phosphate and natural gas. Russia and its satellite Belarus produce more than a third of the world's potash and, of course, dominate natural gas. Belarus' potash exports were strangled by Western sanctions even before the war. Russia cut theirs by executive order on March 4,"" Barron's published in late March. This whole situation has sent potash prices soaring by around 75% this year; while urea prices have risen by 60% between February and March. If you want to invest in this sector, which has experienced a strong concentration in a few hands in the last decade, you have a choice among the nine companies proposed by elEconomista: OCI, ScottsMiracle-Gro, Corteva, Incitec Pivot, Nutrien, Nissan Chemical Corporation, Sociedad QuÃ­mica y Minera de Chile, FMC and Mosaic. They are all worth more than 5 billion euros on the stock market, are followed by more than 5 analysts and receive a buy recommendation from the analysts' consensus collected by FactSet. At the beginning of March, the Nasdaq website highlighted Mosaic as one of the stocks to watch in the agrochemical sector - ""a world leader in the integrated production of concentrated phosphate and potash"". In particular, they highlighted its record revenues of 10.45 billion euros in 2021, 37% higher than the previous year, as well as earnings per share of 4.27 dollars. On the other hand, the investment advisory firm Cabot Wealth recently focused on Sociedad QuÃ­mica y Minera de Chile, better known for its lithium production than for fertilizers -despite the fact that these represent around a third of gross profit- ""SQM is better positioned than most fertilizer companies, as it is diversified"", Cabot Wealth points out. They believe that with rising chemical prices and difficulties in obtaining supplies of major fertilizers in the coming months, the Chilean company ""could step in to fill the gap left by Russian potash exports, as management projects a 10% increase in potash sales volumes by 2022."" ""Russian fertilizer supply is elastic to some extent."" In addition to their buy recommendation, some of these companies stand out because of how cheaply they are trading. For this year's earnings of Dutch OCI, Australian Incitec Pivot and U.S.-based Nutrien and Mosaic, multiples of less than 10 times are being paid. Moreover, in terms of earnings growth for the 2021-2024 period, Incitec Pivot (297%), Sociedad QuÃ­mica y Minera de Chile (212%), FMC (56%) and Corteva (42%) stand out. ""Non-Russian fertilizer supply is elastic to some extent. Nutrien may have five or six tons of spare potash capacity, more than a third of what is offline from Russia and Belarus,"" reckons Brian Madden, chief investment officer at First Avenue Investment Counsel in Toronto. ""Nutrien could be the Saudi Arabia of potash,"" he says in remarks picked up by Barron's. He adds, ""The Saudi kingdom itself and its Gulf neighbors are using their abundant gas reserves to increase nitrogen fertilizer production by 7% to 9% a year."" But Madden is cautious. ""You are entering the seventh or eighth inning of the current investment cycle,"" he says. ""Current prices are sowing the seeds of demand destruction later this year."" In this context, the analyst recalls the last fertilizer supercycle, which peaked in 2009. ""Potash prices nearly tripled in 15 months, then plummeted by half over the next year. Shares of PotashCorp, one of Nutrien's predecessor companies, lost 80% of their value,"" he warns.  Jim Cramer, fund manager and host of the Mad Money show on US CNBC, said in March: ""If you want to bet on fertilizer, recognize that it's a short-term trade, not an investment, so be prepared to ring the cash register quickly on the way up and be prepared to cut your losses."

788,0,UPDATE 6-China suspected in hack of journalists at News Corp,545 words,Reuters News,"Feb 4 (Reuters) - Digital intruders broke into News Corp email accounts and compromised the data of an unspecified number of journalists, the company disclosed Friday. The media firm's internet security adviser said the hack was likely aimed at gathering intelligence for Beijing's benefit.  News Corp, which publishes the Wall Street Journal, said the breach was discovered in late January and affected emails and documents of what it described as a limited number of employees, including journalists. It said that cybersecurity firm Mandiant had contained the breach.  David Wong, vice president of consulting at Mandiant, said the hackers were believed to have ""a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests."" A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said he was unaware of the details of the reports but that he hoped ""there can be a professional, responsible and evidence-based approach to identifying cyber-related incidents, rather than making allegations based on speculations."" In a letter seen by Reuters, company executives told their employees that âwe believe the activity affected a limited number of business email accounts and documents from News Corp headquarters, News Technology Services, Dow Jones, News UK, and New York Post.ï¿½?""Our preliminary analysis indicates that foreign government involvement may be associated with this activity, and that some data was taken,"" executives said. The company added that its other business units, including HarperCollins Publishers, Move, News Corp Australia, Foxtel, REA, and Storyful, were not targeted in the attack. News Corp shares were down 1.3% in morning trading. The Wall Street Journal, which reported the news first, competes with Reuters, the news division of Thomson Reuters Corp (TRI.TO), in supplying news to media outlets. Chinese hackers have repeatedly been blamed for hacks of journalists both in the United States and elsewhere. In 2013, for example, the New York Times reported a breach which it said had affected 53 personal computers belonging to its employees. The paper said the timing of those intrusions corresponded with its investigation into the wealth accumulated by relatives of Wen Jiabao, Chinaâs then-prime minister. The report was the first in a series of contemporaneous disclosures about similar intrusions or attempted intrusions at other U.S. media organizations, including Bloomberg, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal. Beijing's hackers have been targeting Western journalists for years, said Mike McLellan, the director of intelligence at cybersecurity firm Secureworks, which has tracked China-linked spying on media organizations on-and-off over the past decade. He said journalists might have access to valuable sources of intelligence about China's adversaries or its domestic opponents. Even considered against China's reputation for aggressive cyber espionage against a range of targets - from military secrets to intellectual property - McLellan said media remained a favorite. âJournalists ï¿½?and the things they're working on ï¿½?are fairly high on their list of priorities,"" he said.

837,1,Business activity growth in south west hits ten-month high in March,784 words,Daily Echo,"The headline NatWest South West Business Activity Index ï¿½?a seasonally adjusted index that measures the month-on-month change in the combined output of the regionâs manufacturing and service sectors ï¿½?rose from 59.6 in February to 64.3 in March, to signal the sharpest increase in output since May 2021. The upturn was the joint-strongest seen of all 12 monitored UK regions (on a par with Yorkshire & Humber). The seasonally adjusted New Business Index pointed to a further improvement in overall new orders received by south west private sector firms in March. Furthermore, the rate of growth quickened for the third month in a row to reach the strongest since May 2021. Greater intakes of new business were often linked by panellists to stronger customer demand as the impact of the pandemic continued to fade. There were also mentions of new client wins. In contrast, new order intakes rose at a softer pace across the UK as a whole, and one that was slower than that seen in the south west. South west private sector businesses generally expect output to expand over the next year, but overall optimism softened in March. Notably, the level of positive sentiment slipped to a near two-year low and was weaker than the UK-wide trend. While many firms anticipate that activity will continue to recover due to the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions, there were concerns over rising costs, supply chain disruption and labour shortages. Latest survey data pointed to a sharp and accelerated rise in staffing levels at south west private sector firms at the end of the first quarter. Furthermore, the rate of job creation was the steepest seen since August 2021. Anecdotal evidence indicated that firms expanded their workforce numbers to meet rising customer demand and due to efforts to fill vacancies. On a regional basis, only London registered a faster increase in employment than that seen in the south west. Although the level of work-in-hand (but not yet completed) continued to rise across south west private sector companies in March, the rate of increase slowed for the second successive month. Moreover, the pace of accumulation was the slowest seen since the current period of expansion began a year ago and only marginal. Higher backlogs were often linked to rising sales, but some firms mentioned that higher staff numbers had helped to alleviate some pressure on capacity. Outstanding business meanwhile increased modestly across the UK as a whole in March, with the rate of growth also easing since February. Average input costs faced by private sector firms in the south west increased for the twenty-second month in a row in March. Notably, the rate of inflation was the joint-second strongest in the series history (beaten only by November 2021). The upturn was not quite as sharp as that seen at the national level, however. Panel members indicated a widespread increase in expenses, with energy, fuel, labour, transport and raw materials mentioned in particular. Adjusted for seasonal factors, the Prices Charged Index pointed to a sustained rise in output charges set by south west private sector companies in March. Furthermore, the rate of inflation was the sharpest seen since the series began in November 1999. Where higher selling prices were reported, companies often linked this to the pass-through of additional costs to customers. A record rise in output prices was also seen at the national level, and one that was quicker than that seen in the south west. Paul Edwards, chair ofNatWest South West Regional Board, said:âBusiness activity across the south west surged at the quickest rate for 10 months in March as the impact of the pandemic continued to fade and customer demand strengthened further. ""Notably, the south west, along with Yorkshire & Humber, posted the sharpest rise in output of all 12 UK regions at the end of the first quarter. ""The recovery was accompanied by further steep increases in costs, however, which led to a record upturn in selling prices. Rising expenses, supply chain disruption and labour shortages weighed on business confidence, which fell to a 23-month low."""

The sector has suffered huge losses with 25% permanent restaurant closures after the second lockdown. As an industry, the safety of our patrons and colleagues is the top priority and we shall fully abide by the 50% occupancy rule, however, if cases remain low, we really hope that even these restrictions are reconsidered as this will play a key role in ensuring the industryâs survival. It is our humble submission that if flights are allowed to run at full occupancy then definitely restaurants, which have a far greater distance between tables, should be allowed the same.âRestaurateur and Delhi chapter head of NRAI, Priyank Sukhija, says that the recent shutdown, which was within a few months of reopening, hugely impacted the restaurant and nightlife business in the Capital. âWhile the reopening of restaurants and bars for dining is a welcome move, there are cities like Mumbai which didnât shut restaurants even for a single day. I think itâs high time that restaurants be allowed to operate without restrictions like other businesses,ï¿½?says Priyank.While restaurateurs welcome the move of reopening restaurants in the National Capital, many are still worried about the night curfew'Longer operating hours will help generate better revenueâOn Thursday, it was also decided that although the weekend lockdown will end in Delhi, the night curfew (from 10pm to 5am) will continue, which is another challenge for restaurateurs. âThe night curfews are a big hurdle for us as people work during the day and prefer stepping out late for dinner. Longer operating hours can help with better rotation of tables and will generate some revenue,ï¿½?says restaurateur Dinesh Arora. Restaurateur Akshay Anand adds, âOur dinner clientele starts visiting around 9.30pm-10pm and by that time, we need to shut down. Dinner hours give us 80 per cent of our revenue and I donât think we can get that revenue even as we reopen. So, we hope we are allowed to open till our licensed timings.ï¿½?Satyajit Dhingra, chief regional officer ï¿½?North of a restaurant chain, says, âConstant closures and rules which curtail us from functioning to our full potential wonât help much. We urge the government to help us with sustainable solutions to allow this industry regain its foothold. While 50 per cent capacity is something that we have been working with, we would also urge the government to re-examine the time restrictions. Allowing us to remain open as per license closing timings will actually reduce overcrowding and will allow us to serve our patrons in a systematic manner.ï¿½?âTo recover from the kind of losses that we have suffered in the last two years, we should be allowed to operate without any restrictions,ï¿½?adds restaurateur Vikrant Batra.'We request the government to support the hospitality sectorâMany restaurant have had to shut shop permanently, while others are on the verge of closure, resulting in loss of employment for many. Restaurateurs say that the industry needs urgent support from the government to survive. âAfter two years of severe losses, we humbly request some form of help from the government, starting with restoration of ITC (input tax credit) as it will help us to keep our heads above water and there can be some hope of recovering the losses,ï¿½?says restaurateur Zorawar Kalra. Restaurateur Amit Bagga adds, âWe hope the government starts recognising the food and beverage industry and gives us some relief, like allowing GST input tax, which will help in encouraging fresh investment and in turn create more jobs.ï¿½?For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

1,0,"When Quitting Normalizes, Benefit to Low-Wage Workers May Subside; Prepandemic evidence shows lengthening tenure alone not enough to improve job quality for some workers, economists say",828 words,The Wall Street Journal Online,"The resulting imbalance between available jobs and workers to fill them favored the workers, said Nick Bunker, an economist at the jobs site Indeed. In December, job openings exceeded job seekers by five million, up from just over one million in January 2020. Three percent of workers quit their job that month, up from 2.3% in January 2020. December's quit rate was twice as high in leisure and hospitality, a proxy for the low-wage workforce, compared with the overall workforce. To attract and retain such workers, restaurant and retail chains announced major wage increases throughout 2021 and early 2022. McDonald's Corp.'s U.S. restaurants raised wages by an average of 15%[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/mcdonalds-sales-rise-as-u-s-menu-prices-climb-11635332402] last year, while Target Corp. in February said starting hourly wages for store and supply-chain workers will range from $15 to $24. But quitting may have peaked. Quit rates in leisure and hospitality have dropped to 5.6% in February 2022 from 5.9% in November 2021, which suggests demand for workers has eased. In concert with that, wage growth is moderating. Rank-and-file leisure and hospitality workers are making 14.9% more than a year ago, but wage gains in that sector have dropped or held steady for three straight months. ""While quitting is still elevated and wage gains are still elevated, a lot of the particularly advantageous situation those workers were in summer 2021 has faded a bit,"" Mr. Bunker said. Quit rates returning to normal would be consistent with prepandemic trends. In the decades before the pandemic, young and low-wage workers, whose job tenures are typically shorter than older and higher-paid workers, generally saw their tenure lengthen. A study[https://www-minneapolisfed-org.proxy.library.nyu.edu/research/institute-working-papers/changing-stability-in-us-employment-relationships-a-tale-of-two-tails] by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis found that a set of workers that started their careers in 1979 held an average of 3.9 jobs between the ages of 22-30. A comparable 1997 cohort held an average of 3.5 jobs between those ages. This leads some economists to question whether workers in low-wage jobs have gained much that will help them in the long term other than wage gains that are partially diluted by high inflation. ""There's a lot of movement because the thought is that the grass is greener on the other side,"" said Kathryn A. Edwards, an economist at Rand Corp. ""There's movement but not progress."" The Minneapolis study did find that such workers reported increasing job security. But that may not have been unambiguously positive. The study found that those same workers reported low confidence in finding another job: In other words, they were staying in their current job longer because the opportunities for a better one weren't presenting themselves. That lack of movement probably held back their incomes: during periods of wage growth, gains by job-switchers nearly always outpace those of workers who stay in their jobs, according to Atlanta Fed data. A return to longer, prepandemic tenure wouldn't, on its own, benefit workers, if stability at jobs wasn't tied to job satisfaction and some disadvantages of such work, such as unpredictable schedules[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/a-little-noticed-reason-workers-quit-too-little-work-11646061707] and lackluster benefits, persist. Indeed, during the pandemic some workers[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/tech-jobs-no-college-degree-necessary-11649371535] reaped greater benefits from switching jobs by moving to long-term, white-collar roles, mainly with technology companies or in jobs that require some tech skills inside other types of firms. As a result, some economists say improving the lot of low-wage workers in a lasting way means easing the pathway to industries and occupations where not only is tenure longer, but that also allow for career development and advancement. ""One promising step in this direction would be for employers to relax some of the college credential requirements that have proliferated even for traditionally noncollege jobs in office work, manufacturing, and even construction,"" wrote Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist David Autor in a recent paper[https://econofact.org/the-shrinking-share-of-middle-income-jobs?utm_source=EconoFact Subscribers&utm_campaign=b7298224b4-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_05_21_01_21_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_ec9f988e33-b7298224b4-&utm_source=EconoFact Subscribers&utm_campaign=ca0f0a8f2c-Shrinking Middle-Income Jobs - Autor (memo)&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_ec9f988e33-ca0f0a8f2c-104633765] about how to reverse the declining availability of middle-income jobs, the sort that workers tend to stay at for much longer than ones in the low-wage service sector.

750,1,ECB prepares to end net asset purchases in third quarter,603 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"Today's meeting comes with the extraordinary anti-pandemic purchase plan already completed. The traditional program (APP), whose reduction the ECB decided to accelerate at the last meeting in March, is still in place. Thus, in April, net asset purchases will be 40 billion euros, 30 billion in May and 20 billion in June. The third quarter will therefore be the time when the ECB is likely to stop increasing the size of its balance sheet, in order to prepare the ground for a rate hike. The recent message from Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, suggests that the rate hike will not necessarily follow the end of net asset purchases, but some time later, leaving room for a rate hike at a later date. An idea in which today's statement reaffirms. ""Any adjustment of key ECB interest rates will take place some time after the end of the Governing Council's net purchases under the APP and will be gradual,"" the ECB explains. It also reiterates that, going forward, ""the ECB's monetary policy will depend on new data and on the evolution of the Governing Council's assessment of the outlook. And in the current conditions of high uncertainty, it leaves room for maneuver and ""open options, gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy"". In short, the possibility of postponing a rate hike if growth is damaged more than expected despite rising prices. However, the market expects the ECB to raise rates twice, by 25 basis points, before the end of the year. And there are members of the ECB's own Governing Council who are openly in favor of ending net asset purchases in the third quarter and paving the way for a rate hike. Investors are in fact expecting Lagarde to deliver a more hawkish monetary policy message at the press conference starting at 14:30. Inflation continues to give no respite in the euro zone, in the face of rising energy and food prices. Prices rose by 7.5% in March, an absolute record since the creation of the European currency, and five-year inflation expectations, a very relevant indicator for the ECB, have soared to the highest levels in the last decade and stand at 2.4%, above the 2% target of the central bank's mandate. The weakness of the euro, which has depreciated by more than 5% against the dollar since February, is also accentuating inflationary pressures, pushing up the cost of importing raw materials. But the ECB is also facing the rapid rise in the cost of funding in recent weeks, with debt yields rising sharply. The institution is once again torn between its price stability mandate and its goal of ensuring stable financing conditions in an environment of heightened economic uncertainty."

273,1,Auto insurers brought in $1.3 billion more than they paid out in 2020: Superintendent report,914 words,Postmedia Breaking News,"NDP energy critic Kathleen Ganley said Friday that insurance companies are making hundreds of millions more off the backs of Alberta drivers with the help of UCP policies. Premier Jason Kenney scrapped a rate increase cap on auto insurers in 2019 after it was imposed by the previous NDP government. ""They were able to do this because the UCP removed the cap we put in place to limit increases to premiums,"" said Ganley. ""That's $385 million more out of the pockets of Alberta drivers in a single year. No wonder the UCP tried to hide the report before we called them out on it. No wonder they tried to bury it ahead of a long weekend."" The NDP has accused the government of attempting to suppress the superintendent's report for 2020 and 2021, which have been produced for more than 100 years. Ganley said the increases came during a year when many people parked their vehicles due to the pandemic and hardly drove. Despite that, they still saw rate increases, she said. ""Alberta drivers, when you look at your car insurance bill, remember that you are getting worked over by an extremely profitable corporation with the help of the UCP,"" said Ganley. Kassandra Kitz, press secretary to Finance Minister Travis Toews, said that since much of the information in the report is publicly available elsewhere, the office of the superintendent had paused the release of the annual document while assessing if the report was still necessary. ""They have since taken action to continue the annual report publication,"" said Kitz in an email. Kitz said Albertans deserve an automobile insurance system that is fair, accessible and affordable and that is why the government is committed to examining ways to improve that system. She noted the government introduced Bill 41, the Insurance Amendment Act, which changed regulations around how premiums are calculated. ""We introduced Bill 41 last session that made legislative and regulatory changes to stabilize auto insurance rates, enhance medical care benefits and ensure more options and flexibility for drivers,"" said Kitz. She said seven insurers have filed for rate reductions in 2021 and that across the board, premium rates for private vehicles are down by just under one per cent over the past 12 months. An analysis using industry and regulator data before the report was released Thursday suggested insurance companies had raked in nearly $2.1 billion in profits during the COVID-19 pandemic. An analysis done by actuary Craig Allen that he says is based on figures provided by the Alberta Automobile Insurance Rate Board shows auto insurers in 2020 pocketed $928 million in pre-tax profits and another $1.153 billion the following year. The 2021 figure, said Allen, is based on available numbers for the first half of that year and projections for the remainder. ""My estimate of what the profit's going to be is fairly conservative, cautious,"" he said. ""The COVID-19 pandemic and reduction in traffic certainly through the first half of 2021 that reduced the volume of accidents and claims is the real main driver."" The analysis was conducted for the group Fair Alberta, which includes lawyers, medical professionals and injured Albertans. An insurance industry spokesman echoed the nearly one per cent rate decrease cited by Kitz, adding Allen's numbers are incomplete and skewed. He said it doesn't include more than $100 million in vehicle damage claims from the June 2020 hail storm that ravaged northeast Calgary and more vehicular traffic and probably more eventual payouts in the second half of last year. ""It's inappropriate to take a point in time and extrapolate it for an entire year ... it's not necessarily accurate,"" said Aaron Sutherland, vice-president of the Insurance Bureau of Canada. He said it's illegal for insurance company profits to exceed seven per cent so ""the notion we're making any kind of windfall is fanciful."" With inflation running at nearly six per cent and price increases of car parts and used vehicles far exceeding that, ""we're seeing a lot of pressure on pocketbooks but auto insurance isn't one of them."" He agreed many insurers' financial picture has improved recently but that some companies are doing considerably better than others. dshort@postmedia.com( mailto:dshort@postmedia.com ) BKaufmann@postmedia.com( mailto:BKaufmann@postmedia.com ) More news, fewer ads, faster load time: Get unlimited, ad-lite access to the Calgary Herald, Calgary Sun, National Post and 13 other Canadian news sites for just $14/month or $140/year.

271,1,How Porsche's Jewish co-founder was driven out of the company by the Nazis,2807 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"Adolf Rosenberger could not have been more different from Germany's new chancellor, despite the shared name. The handsome, tech-savvy German Jew had been a Mercedes racing driver. Some of his racing cars were designed by Ferdinand Porsche. Rosenberger's racing career ended abruptly in 1926, after a serious accident at the Berlin Grand Prix that left three dead; he was seriously injured. Instead, he began investing in real estate in his hometown of Pforzheim, then partnered with Porsche to help finance his racing car designs and turn them into drivable prototypes. When Ferdinand Porsche opened his eponymous firm in Stuttgart at the height of the Great Depression, it was the first time the fifty-five-year-old mustachioed autodidact had struck out on his own as an entrepreneur. Those in the automotive industry saw Porsche as an ""unemployed perfectionist"" due to his lack of financial discipline and volatile temperament. So Porsche started his own company. He hired veteran engineers and partnered with co-founders who could provide balance where he lacked. But Porsche couldn't overcome his worst impulses. He still threw tantrums, once grabbing the wide-brimmed hat he always wore, throwing it on the ground and stomping on it like a petulant child. Besides, his designs were still too expensive. They would never be approved for production during a depression. He found himself facing bankruptcy. When Hitler took power, Porsche had just turned down a job to head up vehicle production for Joseph Stalin's Soviet regime in Moscow. After careful consideration, Porsche turned down this lifeline. He considered himself too old and, besides, he didn't speak Russian. Politics didn't matter to Porsche; he cared only about his car designs. When the dictator at home threw Porsche another life preserver, he grabbed it with both hands. In late June 1934, Ferdinand Porsche signed a contract with the skeptical and reluctant Reich Association of the German Automobile Industry to develop the Volkswagen, a ""people's car"" that would cost only 1,000 reichsmarks [or about $8,200 in today's dollars], in ten months. . It was a Herculean task. Ultimately, Porsche would need 1.75 million reichsmarks [about $14 million], two years, three versions of the design, and a lot of political coddling of Hitler to complete a proper prototype of the Volkswagen. Meanwhile, Porsche and his son-in-law, Anton PiÃ«ch, tightened the family's grip on the Stuttgart car design office. On September 5, 1935, ten days before the Nuremberg race laws were enacted, the Gestapo arrested Rosenberger in his hometown near Stuttgart, charged him with ""racial dishonor"" and placed him in custody in Karlsruhe. His ""crime"" was dating a gentile girl. Given his prominence as a Jewish businessman and former race car driver, Rosenberger had been warned that he was a target of the Gestapo. He ignored the writing on the wall. Five weeks earlier, on July 30, 1935, Rosenberger had transferred his 10 percent stake in the car design company to Porsche's twenty-five-year-old son, Ferry. The young man had been working for his father's firm for nearly five years, under the tutelage of Porsche and veteran engineers. The once struggling company eventually became profitable through Volkswagen's contract with Porsche and a race car design he and Rosenberger had developed. The company's profits that year approached 170,000 reichsmarks [or $1.5 million today]. Porsche and PiÃ«ch then began buying the shares of the two shareholders who were not part of the family - Rosenberger and Hans von Veyder-Malberg. An asset was considered Aryanized in the Third Reich when the Jewish ""element"" of ownership was removed. Aryanizations could involve paying less than actual value for Jewish-owned businesses, houses, land, jewelry, gold, art, or stocks, as had been the case with Rosenberger; it could extend to outright theft of possessions. Because of Nazi Germany's penchant for formal legal procedure, Aryanizations often had the appearance of a normal business transaction. But eventually that subtlety was discarded. In fact, the duo bought Rosenberger for exactly the same nominal amount they had paid for their founding stake in Porsche in 1930: just 3,000 Reichsmarks [$25,500]. Despite all that Rosenberger had done for the company, the price severely undervalued his Porsche shares. It was held against me that no pennant [certification] or similar would be granted as a Jew-free company as long as I was a shareholder.... I do not accuse Mr. Porsche and Mr. PiÃ«ch in any way. of personal anti-Semitism,"" Rosenberger later stated. But ... they used my membership as a Jew to get rid of me on the cheap,"" he said. Porsche and PiÃ«ch denied the accusation. Still, regardless of motive, the duo's acquisition of Rosenberger's stake in Porsche was an ?Aryanization? as clear as day. On September 23, 1935, after nearly three weeks in Gestapo prison, Rosenberger was transferred to Kislau, a concentration camp south of Heidelberg. After four days of beatings, he was suddenly released. Baron von Veyder-Malberg, Rosenberger's successor at Porsche, had intervened with the Gestapo in Karlsruhe, successfully lobbying for his release. But Rosenberger still had to pay the Gestapo 53.40 reichsmarks [$455] for his time in ""protective custody,"" as the euphemism went. Despite later claims to the contrary, Ferdinand Porsche and Anton PiÃ«ch did nothing to secure their co-founder's freedom. Through his lawyer, Rosenberger begged Porsche to help him save his life, but Porsche was too busy hobnobbing at the Spanish Grand Prix outside Bilbao. Rosenberger left Germany a month later and moved to Paris in November 1935. After his departure as Porsche's commercial director in early 1933, he had been working on contract for the design firm. Even after his imprisonment, the thirty-five-year-old remained the company's foreign representative, licensing Porsche patents in France, England, and the United States. Rosenberger could keep 30 percent of the sales provisions with a contract running until 1940, or so he thought. In early June 1938, Rosenberger received a letter at his Paris apartment on Avenue Marceau, just around the corner from the Arc de Triomphe. The message from Stuttgart contained bad news. Baron Hans von Vey-der-Malberg informed his predecessor that Porsche could no longer maintain its patent license contract with him ""on higher authority."" The man who had freed Rosenberger from a concentration camp was now cutting off all professional and personal contact due to ""certain aggravations in the internal situation. The letter was dated June 2, a week after Hitler laid the foundation stone for the Volkswagen factory. Ferdinand Porsche and Anton PiÃ«ch were severing their last ties with the firm's Jewish co-founder. On July 23, 1938, Rosenberger wrote to PiÃ«ch, who was also the company's tough legal advisor, suggesting two ways to part amicably: $12,000 [or about $240,000] to start over in the United States or a transfer of the U.S. patent license from Porsche to Rosenberger . To add insult to Aryanization, Anton PiÃ«ch coldly rejected the proposal [on August 24, 1938]. My company does not recognize his claims under any circumstances and rejects them for lack of legal basis,"" he said. That same month, the Gestapo began the process of revoking Rosenberger's German citizenship. It was time for him to leave Europe. Rosenberger never returned to Porsche. He emigrated to America in 1940 and lived under the name Alan Robert in Los Angeles. In 1948, the Jewish Ã©migrÃ© wanted restitution: to be reinstated as a shareholder of the company he had co-founded, with the same stake that Ferdinand Porsche and Anton PiÃ«ch had acquired from him in their 1935 Aryanization. When the case went to court in late September 1950, a lawyer for Porsche and PiÃ«ch proposed a settlement to Rosenberger's lawyer: 50,000 German marks [or $144,000] plus a car. Rosenberger was offered a choice: a luxury version of the Volkswagen Beetle or a Porsche 356, the first sports car with the family name, designed by Porsche's son Ferry. Rosenberger was still in Los Angeles caring for his wife, who was ill, so his lawyer agreed to the deal without consulting him. Instead, he informed Rosenberger by letter after the matter was concluded. Rosenberger ended up choosing the Volkswagen Beetle. In December 1967, Adolf Rosenberger died as Alan Robert in Los Angeles of a heart attack. The persecuted Porsche co-founder was already only sixty-seven years old. After his agreement with the company and the death of Ferdinand Porsche and Anton PiÃ«ch in the early 1950s, Rosenberger traveled back to Stuttgart and met with Ferry, now CEO of the Porsche company. Rosenberger offered him patents and hoped to represent Porsche in California. After all that had happened, Rosenberger still wanted to be part of the company he had helped establish. Ferry responded evasively and nothing came of it. Nearly a decade after Rosenberger's death, Ferry published his first autobiography, We at Porsche . In it, the sports car designer not only misrepresented the truth about Rosenberger's Aryanization and escape from Nazi Germany, but also did the same with the stories of other German Jews who were forced to sell their businesses and flee Hitler's regime. Ferry even accused Rosenberger of extortion after the war. Moreover, the former SS officer used blatant anti-Semitic stereotypes and prejudices in his distorted account: ""After the war, it seemed that those who had been persecuted by the Nazis considered that they were entitled to additional profit, even in cases where they had already been compensated. Rosenberger was by no means an isolated example.... Ferry provided an example of a Jewish family who had voluntarily sold their factory after leaving Nazi Germany for Mussolini's Italy, only to return after the war and claim ""payment a second time,"" at least according to his interpretation of the facts. Ferry continued: ""It would be hard to blame Rosenberger for thinking along the same lines. No doubt he felt that since he was a Jew and the Nazis had expelled him from Germany, which had done so much damage, he was entitled to additional gain.... Ferry later falsely claimed that his family had saved Rosenberger from Nazi imprisonment. But it was not Ferry, nor his father, nor his brother-in-law, Anton PiÃ«ch, who succeeded in getting Rosenberger released from a concentration camp in late September 1935, just weeks after the automotive magnates had aryanized their stake in Porsche. In fact, Rosenberger's successor at Porsche, Baron Hans von Veyder-Malberg, negotiated with the Gestapo for Rosenberger's release and then helped Rosenberger's parents escape from Germany. But Ferry stole credit for these morally sound actions from the dead baron on behalf of the Porsche family: ""We had such good connections that we were able to help him and he was released. Unfortunately, all this was forgotten when Mr. Rosenberger saw what he thought was an opportunity to make more money. However, it wasn't just the Jews, In 1998, Ferry died in his sleep at the age of eighty-eight in Austria's Zell am See. The world-renowned sports car icon had published his second autobiography a decade earlier. But in this version, Ferry had changed his tone. The anti-Semitic statements disappeared and he reduced the Adolf Rosenberger affair to just two paragraphs. He continued to deny the Aryanization of Rosenberger's involvement in Porsche undertaken by his father, Ferdinand, and his brother-in-law, Anton PiÃ«ch. Instead, Ferry played the pity card: ""As bad as these events were for Rosenberger at the time, given the circumstances, we always behaved fairly and correctly towards him. For us too, the situation was anything but easy back then..."". In March 2019, the Ferry Porsche Foundation announced that it would endow Germany's first professorship in business history at the University of Stuttgart. The Porsche firm had established the foundation a year earlier, seventy years after Ferry designed the first Porsche sports car, hoping to ?reinforce its commitment to social responsibility? In a statement, the then chairman of the charity said: ""Dealing with one's own history is a full-time commitment. It is precisely this critical reflection that the Ferry Porsche Foundation wants to encourage, because: to know where you are going, you have to know where you came from? The president added that ""the endowed chair is ... an invitation to family businesses in particular to engage with their history even more intensively and sincerely, and the results and possible consequences of this. A statementparticularly audacious, given Ferry's lies about his application for the SS, his blatant use of anti-Semitic stereotypes and prejudices about Rosenberger in his first autobiography, and the Porsche family's enduring silence in the face of it all. The reason the Ferry Porsche Foundation awarded the professorship at the University of Stuttgart was because members of the university's history department published a company-funded study in 2017 on the Nazi-era origins of the Porsche company. However, the German public soon raised a question: was the study really based on an independent and objective analysis of the historical record? In June 2019, a documentary about Adolf Rosenberger was broadcast on German public television. The broadcast detailed the crucial role Rosenberger had played in the founding of Porsche, how his co-founders, Ferdinand Porsche and Anton PiÃ«ch, had Aryanized their involvement in 1935, how Rosenberger fought for recognition, and how he was eventually erased from Porsche's company history . . The documentary also confronted Wolfram Pyta, professor of modern history at the University of Stuttgart and lead author of the study that Porsche had commissioned; somehow, none of Rosenberger's personal papers had been included in the research. Pyta said that a relative of Rosenberger's in Los Angeles had denied her access to the papers she had inherited. But in the documentary, Rosenberger's cousin disputes this. She said that one of Pyta's investigators contacted her, but that Pyta never followed up to go see the documents in her possession. Equally dubious was another finding, or lack thereof, in the study. Rosenberger was bought out of Porsche in 1935 for exactly the same amount he had paid for his founding 10 percent stake in the company in 1930, even though Porsche's profits had increased enormously in the intervening period. Plain and simple, Rosenberger had been swindled and did not receive the full value of his shares. Although Pyta wrote that ?there was no hesitation in taking a financial advantage of Rosenberger's precarious situation? and ?one cannot shake the impression that Rosenberger . . . was swindled? out of his Porsche shares, the professor refused to call the transaction what it simply was: an Aryanization. In the documentary, Pyta said that Ferdinand Porsche and Anton PiÃ«ch made the transaction to strengthen the family character of the company, not because Rosenberger was Jewish. But paying a Jewish shareholder in a German company well below the real market value of his stake in Hitler's Germany in 1935 could mean only one thing: the transaction was an Aryanization. Eighty-two years later, a Porsche-funded historian intentionally chose not to acknowledge that fact in an academic study. Although Pyta later admitted to me in a Zoom interview that the transaction constituted an ""Aryanization gain."" In written responses to my questions, Sebastian Rudolph, head of Porsche company communications and chairman of the Ferry Porsche Foundation, characterized Ferry's anti-Semitic and discriminatory statements in his 1976 autobiography, We at Porsche , as testimony to ""a lack of empathy on Ferry Porsche's part for the fate of Adolf Rosenberger and other Jewish families who had to leave Germany. . . Ferry Porsche believed that Adolf Rosenberger had at least been properly treated and compensated by the company. This is the only way to interpret his annoyance at the renewed disputes after World War II...."
87,1,Good year forecast for Vietnamese tra fish exports,458 words,Vietnam News Summary,"The tra industry had been badly affected by the pandemic, which caused stagnation in farming and processing and disruptions in export. Tra exports fell from $2.26 billion in 2018 to $2 billion in 2019, $1.49 billion in 2020 and $1.6 billion in 2021. Exports to key markets posted three-digit growth rates, including the US ï¿½?the largest tra fish importer of Vietnam, by 120 per cent to $94.6 million, and Hong Kong by 240 per cent to $86 million. The Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers (VASEP) predicted that tra fish exports would expand by more than 50 per cent in the second quarter. VASEP pointed out that tra fish prices increased sharply from the beginning of this year to around VNÄ30,000 ($1.3), about VNÄ10,000 higher than the end of 2021. TÃ´ Thï¿½?TÆ°á»ng Lan, deputy general secretary of VASEP, forecast that tra exports this year would increase by around 20-25 per cent against 2021. According to Agriseo Research, tra fish prices would continue to increase as the demand in the import market remained high while the supply was limited. Tra prices dropped sharply from the peak in 2018 due to an excess of supply over demand, pushing down prices from VNÄ30,000 to VNÄ19,000, which together with a disruption in the supply chain caused by the impact of the COVID-19 forced farmers to close their ponds. This led to a shortage of tra in the first months of this year. VASEP predicted that the shortage of tra might last to the end of the second quarter. However, VASEP noted that farmers should have appropriate plans for tra farming to ensure supply and demand balance and prevent oversupply as happened in 2018. A number of tra companies are set for high profits this year. The International Development and Investment Corporation targets earning VNÄ900 billion after-tax profit in 2022, 6.6 times higher than in 2021. Cá»­u Long Fish Joint Stok Company is set for pre-tax profit at VNÄ200 billion, four times higher than 2021.  VÄ©nh HoÃ n Corporation set revenue targets of VNÄ13 trillion, 44 per cent higher than 2021 and an after-tax profit of VNÄ1.5 trillion, 36 per cent higher. (Viet Nam News ï¿½?April 15)"

984,1,Financial Services Roundup: Market Talk,1455 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"0314 GMT - Singapore banks may see lower wealth management and treasury income in their 1Q earnings, due to risk-off sentiment amid heightened market volatility, CGS-CIMB analyst Andrea Choong says in a note. Loan demand appeared mixed across the banks, the analyst says, noting that corporate demand appeared resilient while housing loans were muted. The analyst expects DBS to report a 15% on-year decline in 1Q net profit; OCBC's 1Q net profit to fall 20% on year and for UOB to post a 1Q net profit of S$961 million. CGS-CIMB maintains its overweight rating on the stocks. DBS declines 0.2%, OCBC inches 0.1% higher and UOB is flat. (justina.lee@wsj.com) 0254 GMT - Bursa Malaysia's near-term earnings outlook seems less exciting as trading activities dwindle, but the stock exchange's shares may still attract buying interest if the government calls for an early election this year, says Hong Leong Investment Bank analyst Jeremy Goh. He notes that there is increasing probability of an early national poll and two out of the past three general elections have had a positive effect on trading activities. The analyst keeps his buy rating with a higher target price of MYR7.95 from MYR7.27. Shares are 0.1% lower at MYR6.97. (chester.tay@wsj.com) 0134 GMT - The growth potential for the buy-now-pay-later sector may be diminishing, Macquarie says in a research note, adding that March BNPL web traffic declined on year for the first time since the investment bank started tracking data. Macquarie says this could signal a ""red flag for the BNPL industry,"" and could be the first sign of a downturn in outlook for BNPL activity, as lower web traffic may suggest that customers are beginning to drop off the platforms. ""We consider BNPL more of a customer acquisition tool, and in the case of declining customer numbers the value of BNPL diminishes,"" Macquarie says. (alice.uribe@wsj.com) 0055 GMT - NAB is likely to increase its FY 2022 cost guidance to ""up"" from ""broadly flat"" at its 1H result, Morgan Stanley analysts says. But the investment bank says that won't surprise investors or be responsible for a negative reaction, if NAB meets revenue growth expectations. Morgan Stanley also thinks that NAB's medium-term annual cost target could be revised to less than A$8 billion after taking into account the proposed acquisition of Citigroup's Australian consumer business. The acquisition is expected to increase NAB's loan portfolio by around A$12 billion. (alice.uribe@wsj.com) 2237 GMT [Dow Jones]--Australia's March employment report at 0030 GMT holds the potential to sharply ramp up calls for the RBA to raise its official cash rate as early as May. Economists expect another solid rise in job creation for the month and a fall in unemployment below 4%, its lowest levels since the early 1970s. Coupled with forecasts that 1Q core inflation will print on April 27 well above the RBA's 2-3% target band, there will be a strong case for the RBA to act in early May. Still, true to its focus on wages growth, the central bank will still likely wait for wage price index data in May and national accounts data at the start of June before raising rates at its June 7 policy meeting. (james.glynn@wsj.com) 2020 GMT - PayPal Holdings' lack of a reaffirmation or change to its 1Q guide following the departure of CFO John Rainey ""is peculiar,"" says Mizuho in a note, because it creates ""more uncertainty into 1Q than the stock needs at this juncture."" Rainey's departure is not surprising following a period of overpromising and under-delivering the analysts say, but the change in management contrasts with payments companies WEX and Marqeta, who both underwent CFO changes in recent months but included either a pre-release of results or a guidance update. Shares fell 2.8% to $105.17. (denny.jacob@wsj.com; @pennedbyden) 1638 GMT - European markets mostly tread water ahead of Thursday's European Central Bank interest-rate decision, though US stocks head higher. The Stoxx Europe 600 and FTSE 100 close broadly flat, the CAC 40 edges 0.1% higher and the DAX drops 0.3%. Brent crude rises 2.5% to $107.23 a barrel and gold and silver prices rise. The Dow gains 0.6%. ""Another cautious day sees US markets edge higher despite JPMorgan's gloomy earnings, while European markets struggle as they await tomorrow's ECB meeting,"" IG analyst Chris Beauchamp says in a note. ""JPMorgan's numbers revealed that dealmaking was down and credit losses had increased."" (philip.waller@wsj.com) 1628 GMT - Ashmore's longer-term prospects look bright, but the asset manager could face a rocky ride in the short term, Numis Securities says ahead of a 3Q trading update due tomorrow. The shares look undervalued on a longer-term view due to the firm's sole focus on emerging-market assets and the structural growth potential that provides, Numis says. However, weak investment performance, Russia fueling general investor worries about emerging markets, a possible Chinese economic slowdown and potentially higher US interest rates are unlikely to help short-term investment flows, Numis says. ""We think investors buying today have to be willing and able to ignore possible further share-price volatility,"" Numis analyst David McCann says in a note. (philip.waller@wsj.com) 1535 GMT - Ted Baker shares gain 3% after the fashion brand said U.S.-based private-equity firm Sycamore Partners Management will participate in its formal sale process. On April 4, Baker said it had received another takeover proposal from Sycamore, as well as other unsolicited third-party bid interest, and was putting itself up for sale. ""Baker's shareholders have been suffering with a drop of more than 60% in the shares between the peak last April and the trough in February,"" Interactive Investor analyst Victoria Scholar says in a note. ""However, takeover speculation has prompted a turnaround and should keep the stock well supported."" Still, any signs that the two sides can't agree on a deal are likely to hit the shares, Scholar says. (philip.waller@wsj.com) 1235 GMT - JPMorgan, as the first bank to report earnings, hinted at the extent of financial pain stirred up by Russia's war in Ukraine. The bank set aside $900M for potential future loan losses, which it said was a precaution in the face of rising inflation and the war. CFO Jeremy Barnum told reporters that about one-third of that was related to Russia. The bank also took $524M of losses in the corporate and investment bank for charges related to its exposures to commodities and Russian counterparties. The bank faced significant exposure to a giant trade by nickel producer Tsingshan Holding Group that was under pressure and Mr. Barnum said that nickel exposure was about $120M of the losses. (david.benoit@wsj.com; @DaveCBenoit) 1141 GMT - While the company can likely manage through the departure of PayPal CFO John Rainey with its interim appointment of Gabrielle Rabinovitch, the company will likely struggle to meet its fiscal 2022 guidance, Susquehanna analyst James Friedman says in a research note. Friedman says he is concerned about declining take rates, or the amount PayPal keeps as a fee for processing transactions on marketplace platforms. A potentially weakening e-commerce market and tough year-ago comparisons could also pressure earnings this year, he says. He drops his price target on the stock to $125 from $220. Shares are off 4% in pre-market trading after closing at $108.25 on Tuesday. (Will.feuer@wsj.com) (END) Dow Jones Newswires April 14, 2022 04:20 ET (08:20 GMT)"

The company said: ""We took down a network run by people in Ukraine and Russia targeting Ukraine for violating our policy against coordinated inauthentic behaviour. They ran websites posing as independent news entities and created fake personas across many social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Telegram, Odnoklassniki and VK."" Meta owns and operates Facebook and Instagram. The press statement went on to say: ""We've also seen increased targeting of Ukrainian military and public figures by Ghostwriter, a threat actor that has been tracked for some time by the security community"". According to the Washington Post, the network ""involved 40 accounts and pages on Facebook and its photo-sharing service Instagram that pretended to be associated with news outlets in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv"". These accounts were linked to media groups in Russian-occupied Crimea, the Washington Post said. ""This was a complex but unsuccessful operation,"" tweeted Ben Nimmo, threat intelligence lead for Meta. He added that the network had ""relatively detailed personas, lengthy articles, spread across multiple platforms, trying to fly under the radar"", but failed to gain traction. Meta said it was also taking further steps. Nick Clegg, the former UK deputy prime minister who is now vice-president of global affairs at Meta, tweeted on 27 February: ""We have been in contact with the Government of Ukraine, and at their request we have also restricted access to several accounts in Ukraine, including those belonging to some Russian state media organisations"". ""We will continue to label and fact check these outlets as well as prohibit ads and demonetise their accounts globally."" he continued. Mr Clegg went on to say that there are currently no plans to block Facebook and Instagram in Russia, as they are being used to organise Russian opposition to the invasion. Moscow is already restricting access to Facebook and Twitter, alleging that both platforms are ""censoring"" Russian content. Russia's media watchdog Roskomnadzor accused Facebook of violating ""the rights and freedoms of Russian citizens"".  Twitter has also suspended over a dozen accounts that originated in Russia and attempted to disrupt the conversation about the conflict in Ukraine. Other social media measures Meta's press statement said that the company is to ramp up its third-party fact-checking of Russian and Ukrainian media, and has launched a ""special operations centre"" to ""monitor the platform round the clock and to respond to issues in real time"". It has also extended safety features to Ukrainian users, allowing them to lock their accounts. ""We've temporarily removed the ability to view and search the friends lists of Facebook accounts in Ukraine to help protect people from being targeted,"" Meta said.  Twitter also said it was taking further measures to prevent disinformation. ""We're proactively reviewing Tweets to detect platform manipulation (or other inauthentic behaviour) and taking enforcement action against synthetic and manipulated media that presents a false or misleading depiction of what's happening,"" it said on 25 February.

520,0,China orders hotel to shut guest room that displayed a live TIGER behind reinforced glass,405 words,Mail Online,"* But the Chinese government fears the glass is not soundproof enough to prevent guests from alarming the animal A hotel with a room looking out on to an enclosed tiger in eastern China has been ordered by government officials to close off the view over fears for the animal's welfare. The white tiger, which can be seen from the hotel room roaming the grassy enclosure, is separated by glass from a room at the Sendi Tribe Treehouse Hotel in Nantong. The hotel is connected to the Nantong Forest safari park, one of the large-scale zoos in the region with nearly 20,000 wild animals. State media said tigers and other animals can be easily alarmed when so close to the glass, according to the Times. While guests are protected from the tiger by blast-proof glass, The Beijing News said the design lacked consideration for the tiger. The Chinese-government owned newspaper said there needed to be further evaluation on whether the design was soundproof enough to ensure the animal's welfare. One-way glass may reduce disturbances to the animals, added the news outlet. The hotel already offers rooms with views looking out on to giraffes, lions and zebras. Resident are set to celebrate Chinese New Year on February 1, ushering in 2022 as the year of the Tiger. China National Radio suggested the hotel was using the Chinese Year of the Tiger as a marketing gimmick, promoting the tiger room ahead of the celebrations. Sendi Tribe Treehouse is not the first hotel to advertise a room with an exotic view. Last year saw Harbin in northeastern China unveil the world's first polar bear hotel. Guests can view polar bears 24 hours a day through windows facing on to the bearsï¿½?enclosure. 'These bears appear to have no fresh air, no space to roam, no privacy, no peace, no view and just artificial stimulation,' said Simon Marsh, the acting director of UK-based animal welfare group Wild Welfare. Zoos and other captive facilities should prioritize the individual needs of their animals, not the public, added Marsh in 2021 when the zoo opened."
491,0,"The fall of cruise company Genting Hong Kong, once poised to greatly benefit from China's forecast luxury cruising boom",887 words,scmp.com,"January 19 was a black day for Hong Kongâs tourism and leisure sector: Genting Hong Kong, which owns Dream Cruises, Crystal Cruises and Star Cruises, announced it was filing for bankruptcy[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3163907/genting-names-liquidators-us278-billion-debt-triggered-bankrupt] and appointing liquidators. The chairman and founder, Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay, stood down two days later[https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3164485/malaysian-billionaire-lim-kok-thay-resigns-genting-hong] as the company, headquartered in Hong Kong and once hailed as a pioneer of Asian cruising, found itself floundering. The entire global cruise industry has been devastated by Covid-19 but, ultimately, Genting was sunk by draconian pandemic restrictions[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3162385/coronavirus-what-are-hong-kongs-latest-rules] in its home port of Hong Kong, where it should have been marking the six-month anniversary of its inaugural âcruises to nowhereï¿½?on January 30.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge[https://www.scmp.com/knowledge], our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. The wider economic impact on the city could be destructive, but some in the industry are trying to hold their nerve. âIt is still early to comment, as we await news of the restructuring ï¿½?it seems from their announcement that Dream Cruises will continue to operate, and indeed they are currently sailing in Singapore,ï¿½?says Jeff Bent, managing director of Worldwide Cruise Terminals, which operates Hong Kongâs Kai Tak Cruise Terminal. Genting confirms it intends to keep parts of the business operating, including some cruises, but it is still not possible to do so from the companyâs home port, with the Hong Kong government having halted all cruises on January 7 due to rising Covid-19 case numbers. Now Gentingâs 150,000-tonne flagship, the Genting Dream, with its 36 food outlets, two spas, 999-seat theatre and two swimming pools, languishes forlornly at anchor in Hong Kongâs outer harbour. Only five years ago, while dining aboard the Genting Dream with the shipâs Swedish captain, Magnus Gottberg, the topic of conversation was the nascent Asian cruising boom. It had been a tradition that Genting employed Scandinavian deck officers ever since the company bought two old Swedish ferries and launched Star Cruises in 1993. Star Cruises tapped into a lucrative market niche that the big players had missed. Cheap and cheerful offshore casino gambling proved popular with Chinese cruisers. By 2015, when China was forecast to be the biggest market for cruise holidays by 2030, Genting was well poised to profit from the regional luxury cruising boom. Dream Cruises was founded and two new vessels ï¿½?Genting Dream (launched in 2016) and World Dream (launched in 2017 and the ship currently operating in Singapore) ï¿½?were designed to deliver the highest level of guest service and opulence in the region. To capitalise on the growing demand for cruise ships, in 2016 Genting also established MV Werften, comprising three existing German shipyards. The move loaded the business with a colossal overhead and a major financial commitment. Big ships take many years to construct and it is rarely possible to change your mind if there is an unexpected downturn in business. And then Covid-19 struck. Global news was dominated by the drama aboard the Diamond Princess[https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3077058/cabin-fever-life-aboard-quarantined-diamond] cruise ship moored in Hong Kong and footage of passengers being stretchered ashore from other luxury liners to waiting ambulances. International cruising collapsed almost overnight. By September 2020, around six months after the shutdown of cruises worldwide, it was estimated the industry would have suffered a loss of US$50 billion. Genting runs a tight corporate ship and went to extraordinary measures to rebuild consumer confidence when cruises resumed. On Genting Dream, all crew members had to be fully vaccinated 14 days before boarding; passengers also needed to be fully vaccinated 14 days before their departure date and pass a Covid-19 PCR test 48 hours before sailing. The shipâs design enables external air to be filtered in, and there is no recirculation of air between cabins. Touchless handwashing stations and a PCR test machine with medical-laboratory-level capabilities were installed along with negative-pressure isolation wards in its medical centre. No cases of Covid-19 have been reported on Genting cruises operating from Hong Kong. It was possible Genting might have weathered the storm. On June 3, 2021, it announced MV Werften had received a loan commitment from Germanyâs Economic Stabilisation Fund to keep the shipyards afloat. And in Hong Kong, even with limited passenger capacity, two- and three-night themed cruises to nowhere within Hong Kong waters generated much-needed cash. But then the loan fell through and as Genting scrambled desperately for time, the company was sunk in its home port. Twelve days after cruises were banned, Genting filed for bankruptcy. âThe more relevant issue now is when and under what circumstances the government will allow cruising to resume, given that it continues in most of the rest of the world,ï¿½?Bent says."
930,0,Cheers! $700m of Sydney pubs change hands,513 words,The Australian,"While 17 Sydney pubs sold in 2020, 12 months later there were more than 32 deals. However, prices were not as strong, with the average Sydney pub selling for $21.5m in 2021, down on the $23.5m fetched during 2020. HTL Property managing director Andrew Jolliffe said that at a time when a large volume of capital was looking to be invested, pubs were a safe asset class. He said the industry was highly regulated, which served as a barrier to entry. âBuyers are looking for a blended mix of revenues including food and beverage as well as pokies and accommodation,ï¿½?he said. Mr Jolliffe expects even more transactions this year. âItâs the second week of January and we have sold four hotels so far, which is ahead of last year which was a record year,ï¿½?he said. The sale of the Hotel Brunswick, just north of Byron, which was owned by Mr Gyngell, a former CEO of the Nine Entertainment Group, and his business partner Delvene Delaney, was the biggest regional deal. The purchaser was associated with the Moelis Group, which also owns the Beach Hotel in Byron Bay, which it purchased for $104m. In Sydney, the sale of the Vineyard Hotel, also by HTL Property, to publican Andrew Lazarus capped off a strong year of deals, particularly in the cityâs northwest growth corridor. Mr Jolliffe said the new year had started well with the $15m sale of the Budgewoi Coast Hotel on the NSW Central Coast as well as the sale of the Fitzroy Hotel in Windsor in outer Sydney, which was bought by acquisitive hotelier Fraser Short in partnership with Todd Jacques for less than $10m. Mr Jolliffe said the Fitzroy Hotel, one of the oldest continuously licensed hotels in NSW, needed some renovation work. Meanwhile, Sydneyâs hotel industry yesterday reported that its highest room occupancies for the pandemic era occurred in December, 2021 when average hotel occupancies hit 45 per cent. Data agency STR said the big increase in hotel occupancies was due to the beginning of summer and the impact of the holiday season, with average rates climbing to $236.64 per night, the highest for any month in the past two years. December revenue per available room, the standard industry measure, rose to $106.38 per night the highest since mid 2021. On New Yearâs Eve Sydneyâs room rates rose to $533.81 per night, which was the highest achieved since December 31, 2019, when rooms averaged $651.85 per night."
683,0,"Ex-spymaster Gen Akhtar, sons named in new 'Suisse Secrets' leak",595 words,The Express Tribune,"A self-described whistle-blower leaked data on more than 18,000 bank accounts, collectively holding more than $100 billion, to the German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung. The newspaper shared the data with a nonprofit journalism group, the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), and 46 other news organisations around the world, including The New York Times. The data covers accounts that were open from the 1940s until well into the 2010s but not the bank's current operations. The account holders included sons of a Pakistani intelligence chief who helped funnel billions of dollars from the United States and other countries to the mujahedeen in Afghanistan in the 1980s. As the head of the Pakistani intelligence agency, General Akhtar helped funnel billions of dollars in cash and other aid from the US and other countries to the mujahedeen in Afghanistan to support their fight against the Soviet Union, said the NYT report. In 1985, the same year US President Ronald Reagan called for more oversight of the aid going into Afghanistan, an account was opened in the name of three of General Akhtar's sons. However, the general never faced charges of stealing aid money, the report added. Years later, the account would grow to hold $3.7 million, the leaked records show. Two of the general's sons, Akbar and Haroon Khan, did not respond to requests for comment from the reporting project. In a text message, a third son, Ghazi Khan, called information about the accounts 'not correct,' adding, 'The content is conjectural'. However, a report published by OCCRP said in the late 1970s, the US backed seven different factions of fighters called the mujahideen who were battling Russia's presence in Afghanistan. US funding to the jihadists often transferred to the CIA's Swiss bank account. 'The end recipient in the process was Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), led by Akhtar,' it added. By the mid-1980s, Akhtar was adept at getting CIA cash into the hands of Afghan jihadists. It was around this time that Credit Suisse accounts were opened in the names of his three sons, the report claimed. The OCCRP report said one of the two Akhtar family accounts at Credit Suisse - held jointly by Akhtar's sons Akbar, Ghazi, and Haroon - was opened on July 1, 1985, when the sons were in their late 20s and early 30s. That same year, US President Ronald Reagan would raise concerns about where the money intended for the mujahideen was going. By 2003, this account was worth at least five million Swiss francs ($3.7 million at the time). A second account, opened in January 1986 in Akbar's name alone, was worth more than 9 million Swiss francs by November 2010 ($9.2 million at the time). In a message to OCCRP, Ghazi Khan called information presented by reporters about the family's Swiss accounts 'not correct', and said it was 'denied' but did not elaborate."
478,0,"For Skiers, a Winter of Discontent",2331 words,NYTimes.com Feed,"But this time, the usually morale-boosting âweâre all in this togetherï¿½?gesture was a necessity, as the companyâs mountains, like those throughout ski country, faced hiring shortfalls and a surge of Omicron-driven Covid cases. Having executives chip in âwas not only a good-will gesture, but it definitely helped with staffing levels,ï¿½?said Jim Laing, the Aspen Skiing Companyâs chief human resources officer. The companyâs hiring has been down about 7 percent this winter and at one point it had 275 employees out sick on one day. âWe didnât shut down a restaurant, a shop or a lift,ï¿½?he said. Across the United States, ski areas both big and small have been scrambling to keep lifts spinning, terrain open and crowds of pandemic-weary skiers happy and fed. âEvery resort in the country is experiencing some level of staffing shortages,ï¿½?said Doug Fish, president and founder of the Indy Pass[https://www.indyskipass.com/], which gives access to 81 independently owned ski areas. At Killington[https://www.killington.com/], in Vermont, where winter staff is down 20 to 30 percent, according to a resort spokeswoman, Kristel Killary, only one out of three base-area rental locations is open and some on-mountain restaurants offer limited service on weekdays. Nearby, Magic Mountain[https://magicmtn.com/], lacking enough ski patrollers to operate safely, didnât open at all one day in early January. Likewise, New Hampshireâs Black Mountain[https://www.blackmt.com/] was shuttered for five days because of a Covid outbreak among staff. Other New Hampshire resorts, like Attitash, Wildcat and Crotched Mountain, struggled to open much of their terrain. At Crested Butte Mountain Resort,[https://www.skicb.com/] in Colorado, the T-bar that offers access to many of the resortâs signature steeps hasnât operated yet this season, requiring guests to hike ï¿½?skis or snowboard in hand ï¿½?anywhere from 15 minutes to half an hour or more to reach those slopes. (âLift ops are hiring!ï¿½?reminds a sign at the start of the hike.) Staffing shortages forced Utahâs Alta[https://www.alta.com/] to cancel its traditional New Yearâs Eve torchlight parade and fireworks display. And Timberline at Mount Hood[https://www.timberlinelodge.com/mountain/ski-area] in Oregon didnât open its Summit Pass area for two days in mid-January. The weather affected ski operations, too, as later-than-usual snowfall in the Rocky Mountains challenged resort preparation, while warm temperatures and below-average snowfall at Eastern resorts taxed snow-making resources. The Pacific Northwest experienced heavy snowfall and frigid temps that wreaked havoc on roads and utilities; a record-breaking 200-plus inches of snow fell in Lake Tahoe during December. As guests have encountered these disruptions, some have taken to social media to air frustrations, and many have directed their comments toward Vail Resorts, which operates 37 ski areas and offers the multi-resort Epic Pass. Epic Pass holders accuse Vail of using a flawed business model that exacerbates this yearâs challenges. The Instagram account Epic Lift Lines [https://www.instagram.com/epicliftlines/?hl=en](started in spring 2021) has nearly 36,000 followers, and an online petition to âhold Vail Resorts accountable,ï¿½?launched in late December by Jeremy Rubingh, a Seattle skier frustrated with logistics at Vail-owned Stevens Pass, [https://www.stevenspass.com/]has been signed by almost 44,000 people. Complaints run the gamut from no parking spots and lengthy lift lines to a lack of open terrain and limited operating hours and services at Vail Resortsï¿½?ski areas across the country. Mr. Rubingh, 41, a documentary filmmaker and commercial fisherman, typed the petition on his phone after driving the hour and 45 minutes from his home to Stevens Pass to find plenty of snow, but more than half of the mountain closed. âI think we should all have a little grace around the pandemic and the impact it has, but when I looked around at what every other ski area in the state was doing, they had the majority of their lifts and 90 percent or more of their terrain open,ï¿½?said Mr. Rubingh, an Epic Pass holder. âI felt disenfranchised as a customer.ï¿½?Jamie Alvarez, a spokeswoman for Vail Resorts, said in an email that âthe impacts of Omicron on our work force was significant over the holidays. At some resorts, we had more than 10 percent of our employees excluded at once.ï¿½?Ms. Alvarez said that meant resorts could not open some terrain and restaurants, and everything from parking to transportation and ski and ride school was affected. She said the numbers have since subsided and the company is still trying to hire. Ms. Alvarez also cited a recent announcement that Vail Resorts will add or upgrade 21 lifts across its ski areas for next season, part of a $320 million capital investment. Mr. Rubingh and other commenters point to a recent surge in Epic Pass sales as one of the primary culprits behind the disruptions. According to a December shareholder report, Vail Resorts sold 47 percent more passes this winter than the previous season, in part because it lowered the price by 20 percent; that equates to 700,000 more passes. But according to the companyâs data, not all those passholders have been skiing: In a mid-January report to investors, Vail Resorts said total skier visits, as of Jan. 2, were down 1.7 percent from the comparable time period in 2020-21, and down 18.3 percent from the same period in 2019-2020. The company also limited day ticket sales between Christmas and New Yearâs and over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend, and will do so again from mid- to late February. Many ski areas have seen robust business, though. According to Destimetrics, which tracks lodging at mountain resorts, December occupancy at 18 Western ski destinations was up 37 percent over December 2020 (and almost 12 percent over the same period in 2019). Small ski areas are busy, too, like Mount Ashland,[https://www.mtashland.com/] in Oregon, which is on track to break its visitation record this season, said Michael Stringer, director of marketing and development for the nonprofit resort near the California border. Soaring real estate prices, lack of housing Labor issues in the ski industry go beyond temporary Covid absences. Vail Resorts has been involved in negotiations with the ski patrollers at its Park City [https://www.parkcitymountain.com/]resort, in Utah, for a year and a half, and just reached an agreement to raise their wages. The National Ski Areas Association[https://www.nsaa.org/], a trade group, reported in June 2021 that 60 percent of resorts surveyed were not fully staffed the previous winter. But the pandemic exacerbated existing issues. The well-documented spike in mountain real estate prices, accompanied by the conversion of many long-term rentals into more lucrative short-term ones, have put housing out of reach for scores of workers who earn notoriously low wages. The number one reason for staffing shortages at its resorts, said the Aspen Skiing Companyâs Mr. Laing, is the lack of available housing. âEverything dried up,ï¿½?he said. âOvernight, we went from challenge to crisis mode.ï¿½?Moreover, in a tight labor market, the traditional perks of a free seasonâs pass and time to ski that have offset lower wages no longer hold the same appeal. Even the return of international students with J-1 nonimmigrant visas, a labor pool that larger resorts typically relied on prepandemic, is not enough to fill the gap. And reflecting a similar trend in the larger hospitality industry, resorts have found food and beverage jobs the most challenging positions to fill. To address some of these issues, at least a dozen individual resorts ï¿½?plus multi-area operators like Boyne Resorts[https://www.boyneresorts.com/], which owns and operates 10 ski areas, and Vail Resorts ï¿½?increased their minimum wages in the past year, with many now offering $15 per hour, and sometimes more. Vail also announced in early January that all hourly employees will receive a $2-an-hour, end-of-season bonus for hours worked since Jan. 1. Ski areas aim to offer more employee housing options, too, though demand far outstrips supply. âMany communities got caught flat-footed, but weâve been investing in dorms and housing for decades,ï¿½?said Stephen Kircher, president and chief executive of Boyne Resorts, whose mountains include Big Sky, in Montana; Sunday River, in Maine; and Boyne Mountain, in Michigan. Most recently, Boyne converted a hotel at Sunday River into a dorm. Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, [https://www.jacksonhole.com/]in Wyoming, added some 120 beds to its housing pool this winter for a total of just under 300 (the resort employs about 1,700 workers, said Ty Hoath, the chief administrative officer). The Aspen Skiing Company offers more than 1,000 employee beds, but itâs not enough. This fall the company took an unusual approach with its Tenants for Turns program, asking local homeowners to rent a room for at least four months to ski area employees, and offering them a seasonâs ski pass as a bonus. The program received mixed reviews on social media, but Mr. Laing said the overall response was âgreat,ï¿½?with 30 residents signing up to offer housing. What to expect Resort operators believe the problems will ease as the season progresses. âIt is getting better ï¿½?thatâs the good news,ï¿½?said Geoff Hatheway, Magic Mountainâs president, who helped park cars and flip burgers at the ski area over the holidays to help offset a 10 percent staffing shortage. âWeâre continuing to recruit, and weâre finding more staff.ï¿½?Vail-owned Crested Butte has been able to hire more lift attendants and aims to open its closed T-bar by the end of January, said the general manager, Tara Schoedinger (she doesnât know if the sign at the beginning of the hike brought in any applicants). âI feel like it will be a really normal experience if someone comes today or this weekend,ï¿½?said Ms. Schoedinger, while noting that because of abundant snowfall in late December, more terrain is actually open than usual at this time of the season. As for Stevens Pass, thereâs now a new interim general manager who grew up skiing the resort and posts daily to a blog with operating updates. The ski area aims to have its coveted backside runs open within a couple of weeks, said Doug Pierini, the chief operating officer and senior vice president of Vail Resortâs Western region, in mid-January. âStaffing is our biggest hurdle, but we changed quite a bit up there in just the past couple of weeks.ï¿½?Measures catalyzed by the pandemic that bypass the need for in-person interactions ï¿½?online ticket and rental purchases, on-mountain ticket pickup boxes, more grab-and-go food ï¿½?also help. And at some mountains, required reservations for parking and for holders of the other two big multi-resort passes, Ikon[https://www.ikonpass.com/] and Mountain Collective[https://mountaincollective.com/], as well as limits on daily ticket sales, help manage skier numbers. The latter two steps have allowed Jackson Hole to get by with fewer staffers with almost no disruptions, said Mr. Hoath. In addition to maintaining employee numbers, ski areas must contend with burnout and the potential for sagging morale, especially this season. Thatâs why in mid-January, the Indy Pass launched a Love Your Lifty campaign, which encourages guests to show appreciation for any resort worker by posting a photo or story to social media. Weekly drawings award Indy Passes for next winter to posters and the employees they highlight. âWe did it to create awareness,ï¿½?said Mr. Fish. âThe average consumer just shows up and thinks, âWhatâs going on? Why isnât that run groomed? Why isnât that lift running?ï¿½?Theyâre not used to that.ï¿½?âAnything people can do to show some appreciation of how hard people are working would be so appreciated,ï¿½?said Aspenâs Mr. Laing. âIt would absolutely make their day.ï¿½?Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram[https://www.instagram.com/nytimestravel/], Twitter[https://twitter.com/nytimestravel] and Facebook[https://www.facebook.com/nytimestravel/].

Consolidated Fourth Quarter and Full Year Summary Thirteen Week Period Fifty-two Week Period (dollars in thousands) Ended Ended ---------------------- ------------------------ February February February February 26, 2022 27, 2021 26, 2022 27, 2021 --------- --------- ---------- ---------- Revenues from continuing operations $6,065,390 $5,916,856 $24,568,255 $24,043,240 Net loss from continuing operations (389,062) (18,495) (538,478) (100,070) Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations 106,075 41,265 505,905 437,665 For the fourth quarter, the company reported net loss from continuing operations of $389.1 million, or $7.18 loss per share, Adjusted Net Loss from continuing operations of $88.6 million, or $1.63 loss per share, and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $106.1 million, or 1.8 percent of revenues. Revenues from continuing operations increased 2.5 percent and 2.2 percent for the thirteen and fifty-two week periods ended February 26, 2022, respectively, compared to the prior year driven by growth at the Retail Pharmacy Segment, partially offset by a decline at the Pharmacy Services Segment. Fourth quarter net loss from continuing operations was $389.1 million, or $7.18 per share, compared to last year's fourth quarter net loss from continuing operations of $18.5 million, or $0.34 per share. The increase in net loss is due primarily to a current year charge of $229.0 million for the impairment of goodwill related to the Pharmacy Services Segment. Other variance drivers include higher facility exit and impairment charges driven by the Company's store closure decisions, a gain on sale of assets in the prior year fourth quarter resulting from the sale leasebacks of stores and distribution centers, a gain on the acquisition of Bartell Drugs in the prior year fourth quarter, and a LIFO charge in the current quarter compared to a LIFO credit in the prior year fourth quarter. These items were partially offset by an increase in Adjusted EBITDA. Net loss from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended February 26, 2022, was $538.5 million, or $9.96 loss per share, compared to last year's net loss of $100.1 million, or $1.87 loss per share. The increase in net loss is due primarily to goodwill impairment related to the Pharmacy Services Segment, higher facility exit and impairment charges, a LIFO charge in the current year compared to a LIFO credit in the prior year, higher litigation settlements, and a gain on the acquisition of Bartell Drugs in the prior year. These items were partially offset by an increase in Adjusted EBITDA and lower restructuring-related costs. Retail Pharmacy Segment Thirteen Week Period Fifty-two Week Period (dollars in thousands) Ended Ended ---------------------- ------------------------ February February February February 26, 2022 27, 2021 26, 2022 27, 2021 --------- --------- ---------- ---------- Revenues from continuing operations $4,433,408 $4,114,485 $17,494,816 $16,365,260 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations 102,419 6,017 392,633 279,896 Retail Pharmacy Segment revenues from continuing operations increased 7.8 percent over the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in same store sales. Same store sales from continuing operations for the fourth quarter increased 8.3 percent over the prior year period, consisting of a 10.7 percent increase in pharmacy sales and a 2.7 percent increase in front-end sales. Front-end same store sales, excluding cigarettes and tobacco products, increased 3.2 percent. The number of prescriptions filled in same stores, adjusted to 30-day equivalents, increased 8.7 percent over the prior year period. In addition to the benefit from 3.3 million COVID-19 vaccinations, maintenance prescriptions increased 1.0 percent while other acute prescriptions increased 9.0 percent on a same store basis when excluding COVID-19 vaccinations. Prescription sales from continuing operations accounted for 70.1 percent of total drugstore sales. Total store count at the end of the fourth quarter was 2,450. For the fiscal year ended February 26, 2022, Retail Pharmacy Segment revenues from continuing operations increased 6.9 percent over the prior year, driven by an increase in same store sales and the inclusion of Bartell's results. Same store sales from continuing operations for the year increased 4.5 percent over the prior year, consisting of a 7.9 percent increase in pharmacy sales, partially offset by a 3.3 percent decrease in front-end sales. Front-end same store sales, excluding cigarettes and tobacco products, decreased 2.8 percent. The number of prescriptions filled in same stores, adjusted to 30-day equivalents, increased 8.7 percent over the prior year period. In addition to the benefit from over 14 million COVID-19 vaccinations, maintenance prescriptions increased 1.8 percent while other acute prescriptions increased 2.3 percent on a same store basis when excluding COVID-19 vaccinations. Prescription sales from continuing operations accounted for 70.0 percent of total drugstore sales. Retail Pharmacy Segment Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $102.4 million, or 2.3 percent of revenues, for the fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $6.0 million, or 0.2 percent of revenues. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was due to increased gross profit, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. Gross profit benefited from higher pharmacy same store sales, including immunizations, partially offset by pharmacy reimbursement rate pressures and an increase in front-end gross profit resulting from higher front-end same store sales and a reduction in markdowns. SG&A expenses were negatively impacted by incremental payroll costs to support COVID immunizations, increases in bonus expense for store and field, increases in workers compensation costs and cycling the benefit from the prior year change to modernize our associate PTO plans. For the fiscal year ended February 26, 2022, Retail Pharmacy Segment Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $392.6 million, or 2.2 percent of revenues, compared to $279.9 million, or 1.7 percent of revenues, for the prior year. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was due to increased gross profit, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. Gross profit benefited from higher pharmacy same store sales, including immunizations, and incremental gross profit from our Bartell acquisition. These increases were partially offset by pharmacy reimbursement rate pressures. SG&A expenses were negatively impacted by cycling the benefit from the prior year change to modernize our associate PTO plans, incremental costs from our Bartell stores, and costs incurred to support our COVID-19 vaccination program, partially offset by labor savings due to the cycling of the prior year's Hero Pay and Hero Bonus programs and the COVID-19 buying surge. Pharmacy Services Segment Thirteen Week Period Fifty-two Week Period (dollars in thousands) Ended Ended ---------------------- ---------------------- February February February February 26, 2022 27, 2021 26, 2022 27, 2021 --------- --------- --------- --------- Revenues from continuing operations $1,693,800 $1,870,111 $7,323,125 $7,970,137 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations 3,656 35,248 113,272 157,769 Pharmacy Services Segment revenues were $1.7 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 9.4 percent compared to the prior year quarter. For the fiscal year ended February 26, 2022, Pharmacy Services Segment revenues were $7.3 billion, a decrease of 8.1 percent compared to the prior year. The decrease in revenues was primarily the result of a planned decrease in Elixir Insurance membership and a previously announced client loss due to industry consolidation. (MORE TO FOLLOW)  Rite Aid Corporation Reports Strong Fiscal 2022 -2- Pharmacy Services Segment Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $3.7 million, or 0.2 percent of revenues, for the fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $35.2 million, or 1.9 percent of revenues. The reduction in Adjusted EBITDA resulted, in part, from the decline in revenues associated with lost PBM business discussed above, partially offset by higher retained rebates in the last two months of the quarter. Also contributing to the reduction to Adjusted EBITDA in the current quarter was an increase in the medical loss ratio at Elixir insurance, as the costs for calendar 2021 were in excess of what we had estimated. In addition, we recorded a reduction in accounts receivable related to a decision to exit our rebate aggregation business. As reflected in our Fiscal 2023 outlook for Elixir, these items will not be part of Elixir's run rate Adjusted EBITDA going forward. For the fiscal year ended February 26, 2022, Pharmacy Services Segment Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $113.3 million, or 1.6 percent of revenues, compared to prior year Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $157.8 million, or 2.0 percent of revenues. Gross profit dollars were negatively impacted from the decline in revenues, a reduction in rebates, an increase in the medical loss ratio at Elixir Insurance and the decision to exit the rebate aggregation business. Outlook for Fiscal 2023 The Company's outlook for Fiscal 2023 takes into account an expected reduction in benefit from COVID vaccinations and a reduction in revenues at Elixir, offset by anticipated benefit from initiatives to increase retail sales and non-COVID related prescriptions. The outlook also assumes improvements in front end margin driven by changes in our loyalty program, greater owned brand penetration and expected expansion in gross margin at Elixir due to our new rebate arrangement, offset by continuing reimbursement rate pressure. We will significantly reduce costs through our closure of a total of 145 unprofitable stores (which includes the 63 announced last quarter), a reduction in corporate administrative expenses and improved efficiencies in worked payroll and other store labor costs. We have also reduced expenses at Elixir associated with our reduction in membership. We expect these cost initiatives to drive savings of $170 million in Fiscal 2023. In addition, the following Fiscal 2023 outlook is forward-looking subject to a range of assumptions and uncertainties described below and in documents that we file or furnish with the Securities and Exchange Commission the (""SEC""). Total revenues are expected to be between $23.1 billion and $23.5 billion in fiscal 2023. Retail Pharmacy Segment revenue is expected to be between $17.7 billion and $18.0 billion and Pharmacy Services Segment revenue is expected to be between $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion (net of any intercompany revenues to the Retail Pharmacy Segment). Net loss is expected to be between $167 million and $210 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $460 million and $500 million. Retail Pharmacy Segment Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $320 million and $350 million and Pharmacy Services Segment Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $140 million and $150 million. Adjusted net loss per share is expected to be between $(0.53) and $(1.06). Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million, with a focus on investments in digital capabilities, technology, prescription file purchases, distribution center automation and store remodels. We expect to generate positive free cash flow in Fiscal 2023. Conference Call Broadcast  Rite Aid will hold an analyst call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today with remarks by Rite Aid's management team.

These and other risks, assumptions and uncertainties are more fully described in Item 1A (Risk Factors) of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents that we file or furnish with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), which you are encouraged to read. To the extent that COVID-19 adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of such risk factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. The degree to which COVID-19 may adversely affect Rite Aid's results and operations, including its ability to achieve its outlook for fiscal 2023 guidance, will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, which are highly uncertain, including, but not limited to, federal, state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and emerging new variants and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. As a result, the impact on Rite Aid's financial and operating results cannot be reasonably estimated with specificity at this time, but the impact could be material. Rite Aid expressly disclaims any current intention, and assumes no duty, to update publicly any forward-looking statement after the distribution of this release, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (MORE TO FOLLOW)  Rite Aid Corporation Reports Strong Fiscal 2022 -3-  Rite Aid separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA SG&A, which are non-GAAP financial measures. See the attached tables for a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), and net income (loss) per diluted share, which are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share exclude amortization expense, merger and acquisition-related costs, non-recurring litigation settlements, gains or losses on debt modifications and retirements, LIFO adjustments, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, restructuring-related costs, the gain or loss on Bartell acquisition, and the change in estimate related to manufacturer rebate receivables. Rite Aid believes Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share serve as appropriate measures to be used in evaluating the performance of its business and help its investors better compare its operating performance over multiple periods. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) excluding the impact of income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, LIFO adjustments, charges or credits for facility exit and impairment, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, inventory write-downs related to store closings, gains or losses on debt modifications and retirements, and other items (including stock-based compensation expense, merger and acquisition-related costs, non-recurring litigation settlements, severance, restructuring-related costs, costs related to facility closures, gain or loss on sale of assets, the gain or loss on Bartell acquisition, and the change in estimate related to manufacturer rebate receivables). The add back of LIFO (credit) charge when calculating Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share removes the entire impact of LIFO (credits) charges, and effectively reflects Rite Aid's results as if the company was on a FIFO inventory basis. Rite Aid believes Adjusted EBITDA serves as an appropriate measure in evaluating the performance of its business and helps its investors better compare its operating performance with its competitors. Adjusted EBITDA Gross Profit includes LIFO adjustments, depreciation and amortization (COGS portion only) and other items. See the attached tables for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA Gross Profit to Revenue, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA SG&A excludes depreciation and amortization (SG&A portion only), stock-based compensation expense, merger and acquisition-related costs, litigation settlements and other items. See the attached tables for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA SG&A to Revenue, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA SG&A serve as appropriate measures in evaluating the performance of its business and helps its investors better compare its operating performance with its competitors.

642,0,Facebook takes down Ukraine disinformation network and bans Russian-backed media,672 words,The Guardian,"Mark Zuckerbergâs Meta said it had uncovered a ârelatively smallï¿½?network of about 40 accounts, pages and groups on the two social media platforms. The network ran websites posing as independent news entities and created fake personas across social media including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Telegram as well as Odnoklassniki and VK in Russia, Meta added. In a blogpost[https://about.fb.com/news/2022/02/security-updates-ukraine/], Nathaniel Gleicher and David Agranovich, Metaâs head of security policy and director of threat disruption respectively, said the networks were run from Russia and Ukraine. âThey were operated from Russia and Ukraine and targeted people in Ukraine across multiple social media platforms and through their own websites. We took down this operation, blocked their domains from being shared on our platform, and shared information with other tech platforms, researchers and governments.ï¿½?The post added that the network had a small presence, with 4,000 Facebook accounts following one or more of its pages and fewer than 500 accounts following one or more of its Instagram accounts. Fake personas created by the network included Kyiv-based professionals purporting to be news editors, a former aviation engineer and a hydrography expert. The network operated a handful of sites purporting to be independent news organisations, which claimed the west was betraying Kyiv and that Ukraine was a failed state. Meta said the network had links to another network it disabled in April 2020 that was connected to individuals in Russia, the Donbas region in Ukraine and two media organisations in Crimea that have since been placed under sanctions by the US government[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/sanctions-against-russia-at-a-glance-people-organisations-uk-us-eu]. The post also detailed the use of a Russia and Belarus-linked hacking campaign known as Ghostwriter, in which social media accounts are hacked and used to spread disinformation. Meta said Ukrainian military and public figures had been targeted and there had been attempts to make their Facebook accounts host YouTube videos claiming to show Ukrainian soldiers surrendering. âWeâve taken steps to secure accounts that we believe were targeted by this threat actor and, when we can, to alert the users that they had been targeted,ï¿½?wrote Gleicher and Agranovich. Later on Monday, Nick Clegg, Metaâs president of global affairs, announced in a tweet[https://twitter.com/nickclegg/status/1498395147536527360?s=20&t=8vmXARbjRWxTJ2wVkoNqcQ] that the company will restrict access to RT and Sputnik in the EU. Clegg said the social media company had received requests from a number of governments and the EU to take further steps in relation to Russian state-controlled media on its platforms. The move followed Cleggâs earlier announcement[https://twitter.com/nickclegg/status/1498014380641951754?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] that Meta had blocked several accounts in Ukraine, including those of some Russian state media organisations. Metaâs move came as Lithuania issued a statement with Poland and other Baltic states asking Twitter, Facebook, Google and YouTube to suspend the accounts of the Russian and Belarus political leadership as well as government institutions and state-owned media in those countries. Netblocks, which tracks internet traffic shutdowns, said access to Twitter and Facebook was being restricted across Russia[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/ukraine-hackers-defend-against-russia]. On Friday, Russiaâs state communications watchdog announced it was imposing âpartialï¿½?restrictions on accessing Facebook as it accused the platform of censoring state media content. âThe Twitter and Facebook restrictions in Russia are significant, impacting major internet providers and effectively slowing down the platforms to the point that content doesnât load and the services are difficult or impossible to use,ï¿½?said Netblocks. Clegg said on Twitter on Sunday that the Russian government was âthrottling our platformï¿½?but the company would not restrict access to Facebook and Instagram in Russia. âWe believe turning off our services would silence important expression at a crucial time,ï¿½?Clegg wrote.

899,1,"Oil deficit to be limited amid weaker demand growth, output increases in MidEast OPEC+",341 words,Trend News Agency,"growth and steady output increases from Middle East OPEC+ members along with the US and other countries outside the OPEC+ alliance (non-OPEC+) should prevent a severe deficit from developing, Trend reports with reference to the International Energy Agency (IEA). âDuring March, global oil supply rose by 450 kb/d to 99.1 mb/d, led by non-OPEC+ producers who more than offset small decreases from OPEC+ members Russia, Kazakhstan and Libya. The producer groupâs long-running struggle with capacity constraints and technical issues pushed the supply gap compared to official output targets during March to 1.5 mb/d ï¿½?the widest since record cuts of nearly 10 mb/d were enforced in May 2020 to counter Covid-induced demand destruction,ï¿½?reads the IEA report. The agency analysts believe that excluding Russia, output from the rest of the world is set to rise by 3.9 mb/d from March through December. OPEC+ is expected gradually to increase output by 1.9 mb/d, assuming it fully unwinds OPEC+ cuts in line with existing policy. Middle East members of the group account for most of the increase. Saudi Arabia is projected to add 780 kb/d while Iraq, Kuwait and the UAE between them could add a similar amount. Non-OPEC+ producers are expected to pump 2 mb/d more. âThe US is set to lead the gains, rising by 1.27 mb/d, while Canada, Brazil and Guyana also post substantial increases. For the year as a whole, production is forecast to rise 5.5 mb/d (excluding Russia) ï¿½?with OPEC+ accounting for 3.5 mb/d and non-OPEC+ 2 mb/d. The US accounts for 62 percent of the non-OPEC+ expansion,ï¿½?the report reads. --- Follow the author on Twitter: @Lyaman_Zeyn"
813,0,Australian mining billionaire files lawsuit against Facebook over scam ads,501 words,Reuters News,"The lawsuit filed by Forrest in the Magistrates Court of Western Australia alleges Facebook ""failed to create controls or a corporate culture to prevent its systems being used to commit crime."" It also alleges Facebook was criminally reckless by not taking sufficient steps to stop criminals from using its social media platform to send scam advertisements to defraud Australian users. The lawsuit comes after Forrest said he made several requests asking Facebook to prevent his image from being used to promote investment plans, including in an open letter to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg in November 2019. Facebook, which changed its name to Meta last year, declined to comment on the lawsuit but said that in general it has always taken a ""multifaceted approach"" to stop such ads appearing and had blocked advertisers. ""We're committed to keeping these people off our platform,"" a spokesperson for Meta said in an emailed statement. Some advertisements, which have used Forrest's image and claimed to promote cryptocurrency investment schemes, have appeared on Facebook since March 2019, the lawsuit said. ""This action is being taken on behalf of those everyday Australians ï¿½?Mums and Dads, Grans and Grandads ï¿½?who work all their lives to gather their savings and to ensure those savings aren't swindled away by scammers,"" Forrest said in a statement. Under Australian law, a private prosecution of a foreign corporation for alleged offences under the Commonwealth Criminal Code requires the consent of the country's attorney general. ""The Attorney-General has given her consent to the private prosecution against Facebook in relation to alleged offences under subsection 400.7(2) of the Criminal Code,"" said Steven Lewis, principal of Mark O'Brien Legal, which will represent Forrest in the case. The office of Attorney General Michaelia Cash did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. If Facebook is found guilty, it will face a maximum penalty of A$126,000 ($90,000) on each of three charges, Lewis said. An initial hearing has been set for March 28, Forrest said. In September last year, Forrest filed a separate civil case against Facebook in the Superior Court of California, County of San Mateo. Facebook has been under pressure in Australia after disagreeing initially with a new law that required it and Google to pay for links to media companies' content.

192,1,Folding Electric Bicycle Market to observe USD 163.71 Mn growth | Driven by increasing traffic congestion | Technavio,1355 words,PR Newswire,"The global folding electric bicycle market is fragmented. The market is fragmented by the presence of several international and regional players. Vendors in the market are undertaking various marketing strategies to increase their market share. Well-established international vendors enjoy a competitive advantage in the market, owing to factors such as the large scale of operations, strong geographical network and brand name, and high investment capabilities. Technavio identifies Addmotor Co. Ltd., Brompton Bicycle Ltd., e-JOE Bike, GFL Group Pty Ltd., Karbon Kinetics Ltd., Open Text Corp., SWAGTRON, VoltBike Electric Inc., Woosh Bikes Ltd., and X-Treme Scooters as the dominant players in the market. The market is driven by increasing traffic congestion. Factors such as rapidly increasing population, urbanization, and an increase in the number of affordable entry-level cars and motorbikes have led to a surge in traffic congestion worldwide. Thus consumers are looking for alternatives such as folding electric bikes as they are eco-friendly and help reduce traffic congestion on roads, especially in urban areas. Besides, many countries such as the US, Germany, and Sweden are encouraging the use of cycles as a mode of transportation. Such factors are encouraging people to adopt folding electric bicycles, which is driving the growth of the market. In addition, government policies and initiatives promoting bicycles and rapid development in cycling infrastructure will offer immense growth opportunities for market players. However, the easy availability of refurbished bicycles, increasing adoption of motorbikes, and the growing popularity of bike share programs will challenge the growth of the market participants. To make the most of the opportunities, market vendors should focus more on the growth prospects in the fast-growing segments, while maintaining their positions in the slow-growing segments. Download a Free Sample Report for highlights on other factors impacting the growth of the market. Folding Electric Bicycle Market 2021-2025: Segmentation The global folding electric bicycle market is segmented as below: -- Distribution Channel -- Offline -- Online -- Geography -- Europe -- North America -- APAC -- South America -- MEA The offline segment accounted for maximum sales in the market in 2021. However, the online distribution channel segment is expected to grow faster than the offline distribution channel segment during the forecast period. The rapid growth of this segment can be attributed to the wide range of brands and products offered on online channels. Europe will emerge as the largest market for folding electric bicycles during the forecast period. Factors such as the presence of high-quality cycling routes, increasing urbanization, and high disposable incomes of consumers are driving the growth of the regional market. The Netherlands and Belgium are the key markets for folding electric bicycles in Europe. However, the market growth rate in this region will be slower than the growth of the market in the North American, APAC, and South American regions.

804,0,Cyber Daily: Biden Administration Forms Cybersecurity Review Board to Probe Failures,711 words,WSJ Pro Cybersecurity,"Corporate security chiefs are wary of reporting cyberattacks to the federal government, concerned that they will get dinged for security failings. It's interesting that the board is kicking things off with Log4jâa major problem that can't be pinned on weak security at a big company and apparently hasn't caused any significant disruption to daily life. Also interesting: Unlike the transportation board, the cyber board doesn't have subpoena power. And Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in an interview with WSJ that the board was intended to find remedies for future problems rather than cast blame for shortcomings. Continued below. Digital Event: How to Detect and Respond to Cyber Attacks 100% security is impossible, so businesses must prepare for the inevitable cyber attack. This event will discuss cyber vulnerabilities organizations are ignoring and strategies to reduce cyber risk. Register Now The cyber board isn't an independent agency like the transportation board and will instead reside within the Department of Homeland Security. It will have 15 membersâthree times as many as the full complement of the transportation boardâfrom government and the public sector who don't need to be confirmed by the Senate. Rob Silvers, the undersecretary for policy at DHS and a lawyer with experience in cybersecurity issues, will chair the board. Heather Adkins, (pictured), senior director of security engineering at Google, will serve as deputy chair. Jen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, is responsible for appointing members, in consultation with Mr. Silvers. Other members include cybersecurity and legal specialists from the federal government, as well as technology companies and organizations. CISA is expected to provide some expertise and funding. DHS said the board expects to finish by the summer its probe of the vulnerabilities related to the open-source software logging tool called Log4j. Officials have warned that it is likely one of the gravest cybersecurity vulnerabilities on record. Read the full story.

Loading systems were disrupted at a handful of oil terminals in the Amsterdam area after a Jan. 29 cyberattack at Mabanaft and Oiltankingâtwo units of fuel logistics provider Marquard & Bahls in Germany, Bloomberg reported. These outages add to the footprint of the incident, which also caused an estimated 233 gas stations in northern Germany to experience service interruptions, according to Germany's top cybersecurity agency. Royal Dutch Shell PLC earlier said it diverted some oil supplies to alternate storage facilities following the incidents at Mabanaft and Oiltanking, Reuters reported.

(Associated Press) Privacy Newsï¿½? Facebook feels $10 billion sting from Apple's privacy push. Facebook parent Meta Platforms closed down more than 26% in Thursday tradingâa $230 billion-plus loss in market capitalizationâafter CFO David Wehner on Wednesday said the company expects the Apple policy to cost it more than $10 billion in sales for 2022, equivalent to about 8% of its total revenue last year. Apple introduced the changes last April, altering its iPhone software to require apps to ask users whether they want to be tracked. The move limited the ability to gather data through apps for targeting digital ads and drove advertisers to alter spending patterns.

No.ï¿½?He said the complicated franchise deal in Russia meant the company was unable to unilaterally change the contract or allow any of the partners to walk away or overturn the arrangement. The deal includes Mr Kolobov, as well as Russian state-owned bank division VTB Capital and Investment Capital Ukraine. RBI owns a 15pc stake in the joint venture, which it is attempting to sell. Mr Shear said: âNo serious investor in any industry in the world would agree to a long-term business relationship with flimsy termination clauses. This is exactly why we say itâs a complicated legal process.ï¿½?He added that changes to the agreement ""would ultimately require the support of Russian authorities on the ground and we know that practically will not happen any time soon"".  Burger King said it had already suspended all corporate support for the Russian market, including operations, marketing and supply chain support, as well as refusing approvals for new investment and expansion. It comes amid a wave of corporate exits from Russia, with Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Heineken among those to have severed ties. Others have found it more difficult to do so.

644,1,"A safe bet: If you want a casino job, odds are on your side",1002 words,Associated Press Newswires,"While working at one Atlantic City casino last year, she went to a job fair held by a different one, and was surprised at how instantly in-demand she was when the recruiter wanted to hire her as a craps dealer. âShe said, âIâll pay you to move to Florida in two weeks,'"" Townsend said. âI didn't know craps, so I had to be honest and tell her, but I went out and I learned it.ï¿½?On Monday, Townsend made her move, getting hired on the spot at a job fair held by the Ocean Casino Resort in Atlantic City. Townsend is part of a great hiring wave taking place at casinos across the nation as the gambling halls compete to add staff while recovering from the coronavirus pandemic that drove customers away and led to staff reductions. But casinos are just one of many industries struggling to add new workers, and they find themselves competing with each other not only for casino workers, but for people with experience in the hotel, restaurant and tourism industries, to name just a few. âGaming is facing the same labor issues that we see across the broader economy,ï¿½?said Casey Clark, senior vice president of the American Gaming Association, the casino industry's national trade group. ""In our recent CEO survey, the labor shortage is a top concern across the country. âCompetition for talent is a huge impediment for growth, and we're also experiencing an expansion of gaming with customer demand increasing,ï¿½?he said. âThose things are problematic when they happen together.ï¿½?That has led to some innovative tactics, including the use of virtual reality goggles at some MGM Resorts International job fairs to let applicants experience what the job will be like before signing on the dotted line. Atlantic City's casinos are also talking with state government agencies about funding new transit options to get people to jobs at casinos from farther-out places. One possibility: something like the contract the Borgata had with a state transit agency in 2008 for a daily shuttle bus between its Atlantic City casino and Camden ï¿½?an hour-long trip reaching clear across the state. In Clark County, Nevada, home to Las Vegas, an economic development official said last month more than 40,000 jobs have gone unfilled since the stateâs casinos reopened after a temporary closure in 2020. During one job fair in February, Caesars Entertainment was looking to hire 500 people. On Friday in Las Vegas, about 6,000 people are expected to attend a jobs fair in which 105 casino and other employers will offer 13,000 jobs. âWork is available whether you are a first-time job seeker, changing fields, newly relocated to the area or retired and wish to return to work,"" said Wanda Gispert, a vice president with MGM Resorts. Nationwide, there were about 1.65 million workers employed in the gambling, amusement and recreation sectors of the U.S. economy in March, representing about 91% of the pre-pandemic workforce, Clark said. The AGA said it does not have a figure for casino employment alone. Joe Lupo, president of Atlantic City's Hard Rock casino, is also president of the Casino Association of New Jersey. He estimates there are 2,000 full and part-time casino jobs open in Atlantic City right now, where the overall workforce of 22,000 is down from 49,000 in 2003. âComing out of COVID, especially last year, after the restrictions were lifted, the workforce supply just has not been available,ï¿½?he said. âIt's been difficult for all of us to find enough people. I certainly know after meeting with everyone last week that every property is hiring.ï¿½?That has very practical effects in casino resorts, which might not be able to open all their hotel rooms, or open all the craps or roulette tables they have. Restaurants that used to serve 700 tables a night may only be able to do 300, executives said. As they are in other industries, workers are reaping the benefits of switching jobs, or taking a new one after being unemployed for a time. Casinos are increasing wages and benefits, and are offering to train workers without the type of experience that was once required just to get a foot in the door for an interview. âEverybody's looking to hire the same person,ï¿½?said Bill Callahan, general manager of the Ocean casino in Atlantic City. âWe always need people.ï¿½?In some departments, âpeople that made $14 an hour a year ago might now be making $16 or $17,ï¿½?Callahan said. Ocean is starting an in-house training program to teach people how to become dealers, something most applicants had to learn on their own before, Callahan added. The Morongo casino in Cabazon, California, has been regularly holding job fairs since December, and has at least four more scheduled for this month. In North Carolina, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians said last month it needed nearly 900 additional workers for its two casinos in the state. Tribal leaders are considering recruiting workers from other countries and housing them in dormitories. And in West Virginia, racetrack casinos told state regulators last month that a shortage of workers is preventing them from operating at full strength for a third year in a row. Townsend, the newly hired dealer in Atlantic City, says circumstances are coming together nicely for her. âI wanted to move up and improve my situation,"" she said. ""These places have to compete with everybody else for workers now, and there's money to be had.ï¿½?___ Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC[http://www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC]"

106,1,Mid-sized oil companies make record profits and invest in business expansion,969 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"This mission has become easier in the last few years. After the price of oil reached negative levels in 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic of covid-19, the barrel of the commodity has been traded for more than a year at values above the pre-pandemic level. And the war between Russia and Ukraine has come to consolidate the commodity's upward movement. The current price level - the highest in seven years - has made these smaller oil companies' shares in the stock market appreciate well above the Ibovespa index and those registered by Petrobras itself. ""We are in an encouraging scenario and with great perspectives with the growing demand for the companies. The market is attributing a lower risk to these companies in relation to Petrobras' papers,"" says Ilan Arbetman, analyst at Ativa Investimentos. The largest of these companies is PetroRio, which has been pointed out by analysts as the most efficient company in the sector in Latin America. Last year, the company had revenues of R$4.4 billion, up 131% compared to 2020. But what caught the analysts' attention was the 152% growth of its profit, to R$1.3 billion. According to Milton Rangel, the oil company's financial director, one of the most important points for this result was the 20% reduction in its extraction cost, to US$11.80 per barrel. With this, the company is eyeing new investments and acquisitions. ""PetroRio extended the useful life of all its assets by more than ten years, producing more oil with less carbon emissions, moving the economy and generating jobs. We should continue like this,"" says Rangel. And the company's account will also include the exploration of the Wahoo Field, in the Campos Basin, which has a potential of 125 million barrels. Since its debut on the stock exchange in 2015, the company's shares have appreciated by more than 5,000%, making it the investors' darling during this period. However, PetroRio is not alone in this market, which is becoming more competitive. 3R Petroleum, which is the result of the union of 3R and Ouro Preto, debuted on B3 in 2020 and since then has become an acquisition machine. With three wells in operation, the company has another six that will begin operations in the next few years. ""We will have 400 to 500 million barrels of 2P reserves (classification of proved and probable reserves),"" says Ricardo Savini, president of 3R Petroleum. From 2020 to 2021, the company more than tripled its revenue, which closed at R$727.8 million. Now, after so many acquisitions, 3R wants to monetize the business - part of the purchases are assets that Petrobras no longer wanted. ""Now is the time for organic growth and to revitalize the business,"" says Savini. Proving to be able to get the most out of its assets is the company's challenge in the short to medium term, according to analysts. For XP, since 3R has only been in the market for a short time, the lack of production history plays against the company, whose paper is trading at a relatively low value on the stock exchange, despite having doubled in price since its market debut. ""Many investors question whether 3R will be able to extract value from the Papa Terra field, where Petrobras has failed. With heavy oil and low recovery factor, the NPV (net present value) of the field is highly dependent on the future productivity of the wells,"" wrote analysts AndrÃ© Vidal, Victor Burke and Marcella Ungaretti. The risks, however, are not only concentrated in the fact that the fields may have less oil than imagined - as happened with OGX, owned by Eike Batista - and in the devaluation of the oil price with the adjustment in demand expected for the coming years. In the world, there is a movement towards cleaner energy sources. Several countries in Europe, for example, have already made the commitment to electrify their entire car fleet between 2030 and 2050. For MÃ¡rcio Couto, senior consultant at FGV Energia, this transition will not occur at this speed, especially in countries with emerging economies - and the high oil prices during the pandemic only corroborated the argument. Therefore, DÃ©cio Oddone, Enauta's president, wants to take advantage of the moment to continue the company's expansion process. ""We will at least double our operation and focus on bringing maximum value to shareholders,"" says Oddone. Last year, the oil company reached its highest profit in history, of R$1.4 billion, a number that helped Enauta to have the highest increase among the companies of the sector listed on B3. The executive points out that he does not see that the transition from oil to renewable energies will take place before 2100, so the company's plans remain on a medium to long term horizon. ""Oil may decrease its participation in the energy matrix, but I see production increasing. But Enauta is also looking to invest in new clean energy fronts in the future,"" says Oddone."
778,0,"Cyberattack on News Corp, Believed Linked to China, Targeted Emails of Journalists, Others; The attack, discovered on Jan. 20, affected units including The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and the U.K. news operation",1037 words,The Wall Street Journal Online,"News Corp said it notified law enforcement and hired cybersecurity firm Mandiant Inc. to support an investigation. A representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation said late Friday that it was aware of the incident. ""Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests,"" said David Wong, vice president of incident response at Mandiant. News Corp disclosed the hack in a securities filing Friday, saying its preliminary analysis indicates that data was taken. A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said that China is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and ""firmly opposes and combats cyberattacks and cyber theft in all forms."" The spokesman, Liu Pengyu, said that identifying the source of cyberattacks is technically complex. ""We hope that there can be a professional, responsible and evidence-based approach to identifying cyber-related incidents, rather than making allegations based on speculations,"" Mr. Liu said. In the staff memo News Corp said it believes the threat activity is contained. The company has been offering guidance to affected employees. ""We are committed to protecting our journalists and sources. We will not be deterred from our purposeâto provide uniquely trusted journalism and analysis. We will continue to publish the important stories of our time,"" said Almar Latour, chief executive of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal. The company's investigation indicates that systems housing financial and customer data, including subscriber information, weren't affected, according to the securities filing and a person familiar with the matter. The investigation detected that the intrusion appeared to date to at least February 2020, according to people briefed on the matter, and scores of employees were impacted. The hackers were able to access reporters' emails and Google Docs, including drafts of articles, the people said. News Corp was still trying to determine the full extent of emails and documents that were accessed, the people said. While the hackers accessed the Google system used by News Corp employees, there was no indication that they breached the system through a compromise at Google, said people briefed on the matter. Google's own systems weren't affected by the incident, a Google spokeswoman said. Reporters who were affected by the hack and were briefed on it expressed concerns to company officials about protecting their sources' identities. By Friday afternoon, many Journal reporters affected had been notified by company officials of specific documents that were believed to have been accessed. The attackers appeared to be interested in a range of topics, including issues of importance to Beijing such as Taiwan and China's Uyghur ethnic group, according to other people briefed on the matter and a review of some of the document target lists. Other areas of interest included draft Journal articles and notes about U.S. military troop activity, U.S. technology regulation related to China, and articles about President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and senior White House officials. The hackers also searched using keywords for emails related to traditional intelligence areas, including defense, one person familiar with the ongoing investigation said. Those searches in some cases appeared to be prompted by contemporary news developments. ""They would come back periodically,"" this person said.

FBI Director Christopher Wray said this week that Beijing is running a ""massive, sophisticated hacking program that is bigger than those of every other major nation combined."" The FBI has more than 2,000 active investigations related to allegations of Chinese-government-directed theft of U.S. information or technology, Mr. Wray said. China has repeatedly denied allegations that it has carried out cyberattacks. In 2013, Chinese hackers trying to monitor news coverage of China hacked into the Journal's network[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/SB10001424127887323926104578276202952260718], apparently aiming to spy on reporters covering China and other issues, the Journal reported. The New York Times had experienced a similar attack. At the time, a Chinese embassy spokesman condemned allegations of Chinese cyberspying and said Beijing prohibits cyberattacks. In February 2020, China revoked the press credentials of three Journal reporters based in Beijing. China's Foreign Ministry said the move was punishment for an opinion piece published by the Journal. The three journalists work for the Journal's news operation, which operates with a strict separation from the opinion staff.

609,0,"Near Kenmore, he's back on menu",1022 words,The Boston Globe,"Now he's planning a triumphant return. Harker has reached a deal to open four restaurants in the Bower apartment building in the Fenway Center development, a luxury mixed-use project on Beacon Street, just a five-minute stroll from his old stomping grounds at the Hotel Commonwealth. The restaurants will open early next year. Harker plans to carve up 20,000 square feet in the Bower's street-level retail space and make full use of the center's plaza, where he'll have a sea of outdoor seating. The two-building apartment complex, which opened in 2020, is the first phase of the long-planned Fenway Center project; phase two ï¿½?which includes a 22-story office tower to be built on a deck atop the Massachusetts Turnpike ï¿½?launched last year. Now the project will have a big-name restaurant anchoring its ground floor just outside Kenmore Square. âWhile there have been dark clouds in our industry for the past two years, I'm as excited as ever to roll up my sleeves and dig in,"" Harker said in a statement. âI'm grateful to the team at Bower for giving me the opportunity to once again be a part of creating an entirely new neighborhood just a short five-minute walk from my home of 15 years."" Harker has long played an outsized role in Boston's hospitality industry. After opening the award-winning No. 9 Park with chef Barbara Lynch, he went on to build B&G Oysters and The Butcher Shop in the South End. He struck out on his own with Eastern Standard in the Hotel Commonwealth in 2005, creating a brasserie whose long marble bar became a base of a different sort for the entire Fenway neighborhood. Known for welcoming a cross-section of the city, it was once called âa perfect restaurant"" by Globe food critic Devra First. In 2010, Harker partnered with Jeremy Sewall, Shore Gregory, and Skip Bennett of Duxbury's Island Creek Oysters to open Island Creek Oyster Bar, and followed that with The Hawthorne cocktail bar in 2011. Over his 15-year tenure, Harker was often credited with kickstarting the transformation of Kenmore Square, establishing the corner of the city as a dining destination that was so closely associated with him that many dubbed it âHarkertown."" The group went on to open several more celebrated restaurants: Row 34 in both Fort Point and Portsmouth, N.H., and a second Island Creek Oyster Bar in Burlington. (Their Harvard Square foray into French food, Les Sablons, closed in 2018 after just a year in business.) Harker also continued with his own projects, opening Branch Line rotisserie in Watertown and launching Eastern Standard Provisions, an artisanal pretzel and snack company, in 2019. Like many restaurants, the trio in the Hotel Commonwealth shut down service at the outset of the pandemic. But they never reopened, in part because of a protracted legal battle between Harker and the restaurants' landlord, Urban Meritage, which ultimately led Harker and his partners to shut down entirely early last year. While the city's restaurant industry has seen an unprecedented number of closures as a result of the pandemic, the fall of some of the biggest hospitality darlings hit hard. Heartbroken diners lamented the fact that they were never able to sample the french fries or roasted bone marrow one last time. And shortly after the news broke about the closure, the partners announced they were parting ways too, with Bennett focusing on Island Creek Oysters and Sewall and Gregory taking over ownership of the Row 34 restaurants and the remaining Island Creek Oyster Bar in Burlington, which they've since reopened as a Row 34. It was all dark, depressing stuff. But now, finally, there are some bright spots. In November, Bennett opened The Windsor House, a new restaurant in Duxbury across the street from the Island Creek Oyster Farm. And last week, Sewall and Gregory announced that a new Row 34 will open this fall in Kendall Square. And as for Harker, the big looming question was not just if he could stage a return, but when and where. Harker had a noncompete agreement with Urban Meritage that said he could not open a new restaurant within 2 miles of the hotel for two years after the restaurants closed. But given the booming new development underway in and around Kenmore Square, there was no shortage of suitors willing to work with him. And ultimately, developer John Rosenthal, whose Meredith Management built the Bower in partnership with the Green Cities Company and Nuveen Real Estate, wooed Harker to the Bower. âWe can't wait to bring Garrett back home to the Kenmore Square/Fenway neighborhood and Greater Boston,"" Rosenthal said. âGarrett has been sorely missed by our neighbors, and frankly, Boston's entire restaurant scene. He is the perfect hospitality partner for this remarkable new destination."" Harker is being mum on what the makeup of the four restaurants will be, but there are clues: Mixologist Jackson Cannon, his longtime business partner who helmed The Hawthorne bar, will be overseeing the beverages. And chef Nemo Bolin, who served as executive chef at Eastern Standard until it closed, will be mapping out the menus at all four spots. New York-based design firm Parts & Labor, which has bagged hospitality design awards for projects like the The Grey in Savannah, will be sketching out the space. More details will emerge later this year. Until then, the neighborhood can take some comfort in knowing that Harker will soon be coming home. Janelle Nanos can be reached at janelle.nanos@globe.com.

488,0,"National Restaurant Association of India writes to Delhi CM, LG to allow restaur",473 words,Mint,"While, the association said, it is understood that the government's top priority is people's health and preventing the spread of the disease, the restaurant industry appears to have been singled out with more stringent restrictions compared to all other sectors/activities. ""There is a need therefore to have a relook at the existing restrictions/curfews, and the same should not be based on the criteria or procedures set up to tackle the previous strains of the virus,"" said Prakul Kumar, the association's secretary general. Experience over the last two waves shows that the pandemic graph in fact continued to decline after restaurants were opened up for operations. As an example, even in the current situation, Mumbai has seen a decline in numbers, without shutting down restaurants. In Delhi, the restaurant industry had been operating at 50% capacity with restricted timings since the beginning of the pandemic - despite other activities like public transportation, metros, airlines etc. being permitted to operate at full capacity at various times during the last two years. Earlier this month, Delhi implemented the Graded Response Action Plan under which restaurants, which were functioning on 50% capacity, were asked to shut down, with only takeaways and deliveries allowed. Despite restrictions, the association added that restaurants have continued to pay full license fees, rents and other overheads during this period. The association said it wanted to be allowed to work beyond curfew hours to avoid overcrowding. There are about 96,000 eateries in Delhi which include both organised and unorganised players. Of this, close to 33,000 are organised with FSSAI numbers and GST registration. The association said revenue generated per year from organised restaurants in Delhi is about Rs.31,132 crore and that Delhi eats out about six times a month in organised restaurants compared to the national average of 4.5 times a month. Overall, the size of the restaurant industry shrank by more than 50% from Rs.4,23,624 crore in FY20 to about Rs.2,00,762 crore in FY21, the National Restaurant Association of India said.

353,0,Williamsburg Hotel Pushes for Interest-Rate Cut on Top Lender; The bankrupt Brooklyn property is attempting to exit from chapter 11 despite its mortgage lender's opposition,650 words,WSJ Pro Bankruptcy,"That proposed coupon is 2.25 to 2.75 percentage points lower than the original loan, according to Benefit Street, which has said it isn't fairly compensated[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/williamsburg-hotels-top-lender-challenges-chapter-11-exit-plan-11642552221] under the bankruptcy plan for the risk of investing in the 147-room hotel. Benefit Street has said the loan balance stands at $95 million including interest and fees, and it is entitled to either full payment from a sale of the hotel or a new loan with higher rates, which the hotel disputes. Exiting from bankruptcy is more difficult, but still possible, when secured lenders aren't paid off in full. The hotel, backed by developers Toby Moskovits and Michael Lichtenstein of Heritage Equity Partners, argued in court papers Tuesday that the payment terms offered to Benefit Street are fair and consistent with its ""minimal"" degree of investment risk. ""The lender is being paid in full over time, with interest, with terms that are consistent with applicable bankruptcy law and typical market practices,"" the hotel's filing said Tuesday. ""Meanwhile, the lender is not being subjected to meaningful risk of nonpayment given that it gets to retain its lien on the hotel and the hotel's value is only expected to increase."" Judge Robert Drain of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y., is scheduled to consider the hotel's proposed plan at a trial next month. The hotel also said Benefit Street's objections are designed to derail a restructuring and force a distressed sale. The bankruptcy plan would keep Ms. Moskovitz and Mr. Lichtenstein in control of the hotel, in return for a $10 million capital contribution, according to Tuesday's filing. Benefit Street has questioned the fitness of the owners to run the business and said a bankruptcy sale or a liquidation would pay off the mortgage in full. ""That is a far better recovery than a long-term, non-amortizing note at a below-market interest rate, with no protections against the depredations of the insiders,"" Benefit Street said last month. Under the bankruptcy plan, none of the principal will be paid off until a balloon maturity due in six years. The hotel said Tuesday that once the real-estate lending markets have stabilized, it would be in a position to refinance and pay off Benefit Street in full. The interest rate demanded by the lender is ""arbitrary and excessive,"" especially considering the hotel is now fully operational and outperforming its peers. Before the bankruptcy plan is considered, a court-appointed examiner is scheduled later this month to submit a report on fund transfers between the hotel and other entities tied to its owners. Benefit Street has accused the owners of diverting hotel revenue, occupancy taxes and Paycheck Protection Program funds from the hotel to affiliate entities, which the owners deny. The bankrupt company behind the hotel, 96 Wythe Acquisition LLC, filed for chapter 11 protection a year ago amid disputes with Benefit Street and as the New York hospitality industry struggled during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine on Thursday also raised concerns about the spread of disinformation about the conflict on social media. With one click, users in Ukraine can lock their profile to prevent users who are not their friends from downloading or sharing their profile picture, or seeing posts on their timeline, Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of security policy, said on Twitter. On Wednesday, Twitter also shared information on how users can deactivate their account. As the conflict in Ukraine escalated on Thursday, social media users took to platforms like TikTok, Snapchat and Twitter to post videos of evacuation lines, helicopters in the sky and anti-war protests in Russia. On short-form video app TikTok, the hashtags ""Russia"" and ""Ukraine"" had 37.2 billion and 8.5 billion views, respectively.

""The first-quarter earnings per share also surpassed an earlier market estimate of NT$7.3 to NT$7.4,"" Mega International Investment Services Corp. analyst Alex Huang noted. ""For TSMC, there were no slow season effects at all in the first quarter."" Globally, the semiconductor industry usually reports a quarterly drop in first-quarter earnings and sales, as it is a slow period in that sector. For TSMC, however, its consolidated sales rose by a quarterly 11.6 percent in the first quarter to US$17.57 billion, beating its previous guidance of US$16.6 billion to US$17.2 billion. The first quarter revenue also rose 36 percent from a year earlier. ""Strong global demand for emerging technologies led to full capacity utilization at TSMC,"" Huang said. ""In addition, the chipmaker benefited from a weaker Taiwan dollar in the first quarter, as it converted its sales into the local currency."" The company's sales forecast in mid-January was based on an exchange rate of NT$27.6 against the U.S. dollar, but the rate fell to NT$28.622 at the end of March. According to TSMC, its sales of chips for high performance computing devices and automotive electronics rose by a quarterly 26 percent in the first three months of the year, while sales of chips for consumer electronics grew 8 percent, and those for Internet of Things gadgets increased 5 percent. Sales of smartphone chips, however, rose only 1 percent from the previous quarter, amid a slowdown in demand for smartphones, the company reported. Chips on TMSC's advanced 7 nanometer and 5nm processes accounted for 30 percent and 20 percent of its first-quarter sales, respectively, compared with 27 percent and 23 percent in the previous quarter, the company said. The 5nm process is TSMC's latest technology in commercial production, and its 3nm process is scheduled to go into mass production in the second half of this year, while the company is developing the 2nm process. In the first quarter, TSMC's operating margin -- the difference between sales, the cost of goods sold and operating expenses -- stood at 45.6 percent, topping its forecast of 42.0 percent to 44.0 percent, according to the report.

560,1,"RÃ©gimen assures that the economy created 15,000 formal jobs in two months. These are the sectors that are hiring",718 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"In detail, data from the Central Bank of Nicaragua (BCN) indicate that the INSS registered a total of 785,515 affiliates up to February of this year, and if compared to the base of contributors registered in December 2021 (769,954), a growth equivalent to 2 percent is reflected. Furthermore, when compared to what was recorded in February 2021, there was an increase of 5.3 percent over the last 12 months. However, the efforts to increase the payroll still seem to be insufficient: between February 2022 and 2017, prior to the outbreak of the socio-political crisis and the covid-19 pandemic, the INSS accumulated a loss of 128,681 employees. Specialists consulted have explained to LA PRENSA that recovering the jobs lost with the socio-political crisis will take the institution many years, if the current economic and political context does not change. Which sectors generated more formal jobs? The nine sectors recorded by the INSS are: agriculture, forestry, hunting and fishing; mining and quarrying; manufacturing industry; electricity, gas and water; construction; commerce; transportation, storage and communications; financial; and community, social and personal services. The BCN statistics indicate that the manufacturing industry reported the highest increase in its figures, since in December 2021 it had 173,074 affiliates and in February of this year the figure rose to 181,270, i.e. it captured 8,196 new contributors. The increase is equivalent to 4.7 percent. In second place is the agricultural sector, with 77,550 contributors in February of this year, after the 72,820 reported in December 2021, which translates as an increase of 6.4 percent. The number of new affiliates was 4,730. In third position was commerce, which includes hotels and restaurants. Specifically, up to December it registered 112,203 insured members, compared to 114,021 in February of this year. The difference is equivalent to 1.6 percent. In contrast, in the reference period, the sectors that were in negative territory were transportation; mining and quarrying; and electricity, gas and water, reporting the loss of 145, 50 and 11 workers, respectively. The slow recovery of employment seriously affects the finances of the INSS, an institution that has accumulated more than nine years of deficits and is not even able to cover its operating expenses. INSS financial situation Statistics from the Ministry of Finance reveal that, as of January of this year, the institute's deficit stood at 236.4 million cÃ³rdobas, which is equivalent to a 48.5 percent decrease when compared to what was reported in the same period of 2021 (459.5 million). Currently, the institute does not have the capacity to cover with its total revenues the most basic obligations such as the provision of medical services for its contributors and pensioners and the payment of retirees. Specifically, up to January of this year, the total amount of income received by the INSS amounted to 2,528.4 million cÃ³rdobas, 360.2 million cÃ³rdobas more than the amount obtained during the same period last year (2,168.2 million cÃ³rdobas). The difference is equivalent to 16.6 percent. Of this year's total income, 2,497.1 million corresponded to contributions made by workers and companies. The remainder (31.3 million) refers to ""other income"", which reflects investment earnings. On the other hand, in the reference period, expenses totaled 2,704.6 million cordobas, 3.5 percent more than in the same period of 2021, when 2,612.7 million were accounted for. In the ""purchase of goods and services"", which encompasses the care provided through clinics, the purchase of supplies, medicines, among other things, the INSS spent 595 million cordobas. Meanwhile, in ""social benefits"", which includes the pensions granted by the Social Security, the expenditure was 1,935.5 million cordobas."

Around 5 lakh people are associated with the tourism industry in Agra. âWith orders of operating at 50% capacity, hotel and restaurant owners will have no option but to curtail 50% of the workforce,ï¿½?said Wadhwa. He appealed to the government to consider the difficulties and financial distress the industry is facing for the past two years and help by offering concessions and compensation. A gym owner, Manjeet Singh said, âWe are following all the required Covid-19 precautions. We are willing to operate with some restrictions but it is unfair to shut down the gymnasiums. Most gym owners have run up debts.

651,1,Why Coeptis acquired a radiation treatment,639 words,Pittsburgh Business Times,"While Coeptis doesn't have anything in its portfolio or in development that treats radiation sickness, it very much has been involved in treatment for rare cancers. Coeptis' cell therapy technology targets tumors precisely so that other healthy cells nearby ï¿½?called CD38+ Natural Killer (NK) cells ï¿½?remain intact. CD38 are cells that are associated with hematological and oncological malignancies and solid tumors. It has agreements with VyGen-Bio and the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, to develop therapeutics and diagnostics. Coeptis' focus is on multiple myeloma, a cancer in the white blood cell that is incurable. In an interview with the Business Times, Mehalick said TLR4 and entolimod will help with its current focus in hematology and oncology and also expand beyond. ""This asset has a pretty wide breadth of opportunities,"" he said. Coeptis' scientific team had been talking to Statera's science team about potential opportunities, when talk eventually turned to entolimod. It wasn't necessarily a direction Statera was going to go, although entolimod has an extensive history including being developed from the Cleveland Clinic and Cleveland BioLabs Inc., which had a strategic partnership with the Cleveland Clinic. Cleveland BioLabs eventually merged with Statera. Entolimod has received federal funding from the Department of Defense, including $9.2 million in 2015 from the Joint Warfighter Medical Research Program, to develop it as a drug to reduce the risk of death from acute radiological exposure, including from a radiological attack. About $100 million has been spent in developing the platform. The platform and entolimod, which has reached the clinical stage, intrigued Coeptis. ""We figured a scenario where we could take it on and push forward development,"" Mehalick said. That was related to using it as a potential to help late-stage sarcoma patients improve quality of life. ""It lends itself in cancer-related treatments, and that's really more of what Coeptis is,"" he said. ""It's an extension of our desire to provide patients with opportunities to fight cancer, and I do feel that some other assets that we're currently negotiating work well in combination with this, to enhance a patient's immune system response."" Yet global events of the past month and the specter of nuclear attacks in Europe with Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also brought to light entolimod's anti-radiation treatment possibilities, too, something that Coeptis will also explore. There are still some things to be worked out, including additional payments to Statera tied to future revenue surrounding the product. There is what Mehalick called active useful product in storage and will be shipped to the United States from Europe. And it's likely that some of Statera's team will join Coeptis, given that the plans are for it to be in a phase-two trial as early as later this year. ""There will definitely be the addition of new staff, especially because it's a clinical-stage product. I would suggest some of the staff working there (at Statera) would come over to help us, because they have deep knowledge with it,"" he said. The deal is likely to close within the next 30 days.

956,0,âGovt. order on closure a slow death for restaurant industryï¿½?303 words,The Hindu Online,"The order issued by the Delhi government on Monday prohibiting dining at restaurants and allowing only deliveries is unsustainable and will lead to a slow death of an erstwhile vibrant industry, said the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI). It urged the government to provide the industry with some âoxygenï¿½?to survive the closure. All restaurants and bars in the city, which had so far been running at 50% capacity and with restricted operating hours, were ordered to be closed in view of the rise in COVID-19 cases. Kabir Suri, president of NRAI, said the guidelines came at a time when restaurants had just about started seeing a respectable surge in consumption, which promp-ted the industry to hire back staff who had lost jobs. âWe are very worried about the fate of 3,01,715 people employed in Delhi restaurants. We donât want them to suffer but unfortunately, we donât have adequate resources to support them for long. Over 25% of restaurants were shut last year and more than 24 lakh people lost their jobs nationally. These new guidelines are going to be even further detrimental to the industry,ï¿½?Mr. Suri said. He said it is disheartening to see that the restaurant industry, which operates in a safe and closed environment, is being asked to shut while some other activities like airlines, transport and markets continue to function. âWe need some urgent oxygen for our survival. I urge the Delhi government to either allow us to operate in normal hours with safeguards and protocols, or compensate us, our employees, suppliers and landlords suitably for the loss of business resulting from the lockdown,ï¿½?Mr. Suri said.",

The service said[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/business/dealbook/spotify-rogan-ek.html] suppressing or editing Mr. Roganâs podcast would amount to censorship ï¿½?but anyone whoâs paid attention to online content moderation knows thatâs a charade. Facebook, in particular, has trotted out that excuse time and again when it ought to have blocked or removed content or users. Donât be fooled. Peer just beneath the surface and it becomes clear that for big social media companies, matters of âcensorshipï¿½?are always matters of business. Facebook, for example, has had special exemptions[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353] from its rules for the very people who are most likely to be believed: politicians and celebrities. More such speech, more advertising revenue. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube remove content posted by regular folks every day with no apparent worries about grand matters of free speech. Removing accounts by Donald Trump and, more recently, Marjorie Taylor Greene[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/02/technology/marjorie-taylor-greene-twitter.html] after repeated and flagrant policy violations was done only when it became a business imperative. If, as Spotify implies, Mr. Roganâs views offend its sensibilities, there ought to be nothing to prevent the service from scaling his podcast back. As the exclusive rights holder for the podcast, it has more control over and responsibility for Mr. Roganâs content than do social media companies over users who post Covid misinformation. But Spotify paid dearly for Mr. Roganâs podcast (a reported $100 million[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/business/joe-rogan-spotify.html]) and the will of two rockers past their primes and a few others, does not ï¿½?from a business perspective ï¿½?outweigh Mr. Roganâs 11 million regular listeners[https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-60192957]. Mr. Rogan has expressed contrition[https://www.instagram.com/tv/CZYQ_nDJi6G] and vowed to more carefully vet his guests. Spotify, for its part, said it will post warning labels[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/30/arts/music/spotify-joe-rogan-ceo.html] on his content and that of others directly discussing Covid. But thatâs all window dressing. Twitter and Facebookâs experiments with warning labels and links to authoritative sources proved unable to stop the spread of misinformation during the 2020 election and havenât been effective in culling similarly dangerous ideas in the pandemic. In a Sunday blog post[https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-01-30/spotifys-platform-rules-and-approach-to-covid-19/] that did not include any mention of Mr. Rogan or his podcast, Spotifyâs chief executive, Daniel Ek, appears to take a strong stance against violations of the serviceâs rules. Still, he resisted calls to take more muscular action. âThere are plenty of individuals and views on Spotify that I disagree with strongly,ï¿½?Mr. Ek wrote. âWe have a critical role to play in supporting creator expression while balancing it with the safety of our users. In that role, it is important to me that we donât take on the position of being content censor.ï¿½?Whatever Spotify executivesï¿½?true feelings about Mr. Rogan or the pandemic, Mr. Ek is really playing defense for his cash cow ï¿½?and if he gives in on this issue heâll have to give in on the next one and the next one after that.

If its âlongstanding platform rules[https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-01-30/spotify-platform-rules/]ï¿½?truly mattered or were being applied consistently, youâd expect Mr. Rogan to have already been dealt with.

Earlier in the week, Chinese health authorities barred Jilin's 24 million residents from leaving the province, the first time such restrictions have been imposed on an entire province since Hubei province, home to the city of Wuhan, was locked down at the start of the pandemic. Chinaâthe world's most populous countryâhas reported fewer than 5,000 deaths from the coronavirus since the pandemic began in 2020.

909,1,"San Group expands again, with mill in Delta; says it will bolster Island operations",393 words,Postmedia Breaking News,"With the purchase, San Group's production capacity will exceed 500 million board feet of lumber, making it the Â­second-largest sawmilling company on the coast next to Western Forest Products. ""This is a compelling transaction for all stakeholders. It will deliver significant and immediate value to San Group by connecting Acorn's production capacity with our current facilities, and to provide current and new employees an opportunity to join a company whose philosophy is centred on increasing the longevity of our forests through value-added manufacturing,"" said Suki Sanghera, co- owner of the San Group. Sanghera said the acquisition will integrate well into the existing mix, which includes the company's new 300,000-square-foot value-added plant in Port Alberni. For San Group, the deal means increasing its global customer base. The Acorn specialty sawmill, built in 1963 and acquired by Interfor in 2001 from Primex Forest Products, specializes in producing lumber squares for the Japanese housing market. Most of its production capacity, about 140 million board feet of lumber when fully operating, is sent to Asia. ""Acorn's complementary sawmilling technology, customer base, and geographic footprint make it an excellent fit with our value-added business model,"" said San Group co-owner Kamal Sanghera. ""The acquisition is also consistent with our go-forward strategy to diversify and accelerate investment in high-growth areas."" In the past three years, the San Group has spent more than $200 million on facilities, fibre supply and transportation infrastructure. Last year, the company spent $15 million in partnership with the Port Alberni Port Authority to improve and take control of one of its deep-water berths. That deal gave San Group, which established three lumber manufacturing facilities in the region, the chance to operate shipping activities at the authority's Berth 3, where it will invest in new facilities and equipment like storage silos and dockside cranes. aduffy@timescolonist.com"
442,0,Bingo halls and casinos decline as gyms sieze cheap high street rents,291 words,City AM,"Elsewhere, the number of snooker clubs dropped to 700 last year, down by 20, while casinos and gambling clubs dropped from 140 to 130. These leisure venues have struggled as the market presence of online games and gambling accelerated amid lockdowns. The number of war game venues, such as Laser Quest and paintball, rose last year, with a six per cent jump. The rise was put down to the businesses being quick and cheap to set up in commercial units. The gym sector has boomed as operators take advantage of cheaper rents, with a 10 per cent jump in the number of sites. There were 4,4000 gyms in 2021, up from 4,000 in 2020. Terence Ritchie, principal at EMW, said gyms were ""leading the way"" in planting roots in territory that has historically been used by retail firms. He explained: ""Most high streets cannot sustain being retail-only destinations in the post-pandemic world. To retain the footfall they need, they are becoming mixed retail and leisure, offering a wider range of experiences for consumers."" ""The pandemic has created losers as well as winners in the leisure sector, with the lockdown accelerating the change in consumer tastes. Leisure businesses that haven't been able to attract younger customers have seemingly struggled more."" Other expanding sectors included bowling alleys and cinemas while nightclub numbers dropped."
573,1,Intel debuts employee recruitment programs in Oregon that could shine a light on Ohio plans,527 words,Columbus Business First Online,"The company said it will accept proposals to fund ""curriculum development, faculty training, laboratory equipment upgrades, novel research to advance semiconductor fabrication and student opportunities including internships."" Meanwhile, Intel is launching two new workforce programs to train employees at its Oregon facilities to recruit workers. Itâs unclear if these same programs will be launched in Ohio. An Intel executive told Columbus Business First that it did not have concrete plans to share yet about its Ohio programming. The company added thousands of workers at its Hillsboro, Oregon, campus last year, and Intel expects the hiring spree to continue as it fires up the $3 billion expansion of its manufacturing facility later this quarter. One program is Quick Start, an accelerated two-week program that consists of 10 four-hour classes. Students who successfully complete the program will earn college credit toward an associate degree and an industry-recognized certification. ""As we scale operations here and elsewhere in the United States, this program is a way to fast-track people into the semiconductor operation,"" said Chief People Officer Christy Pambianchi. ""The program prepares students for a career as a semiconductor technician."" Of the 3,500 employees Intel onboarded in Oregon last year, 2,000 were semiconductor technicians who play a central role in manufacturing chips. Pambianchi called the technician jobs a ""gateway into the company."" The starting salary with benefits is roughly $75,000 a year. Quick Start was piloted in Arizona, where Intel operates semiconductor manufacturing facilities. Intel also is teaming up with industry stakeholders to address workforce shortages through a first-of-its kind Registered Youth Apprenticeship Program in Oregon. The program aims to create a modernized apprenticeship program that can be replicated and scaled statewide across Oregon. The pilot will launch in fall 2022 with half the enrollees coming from BIPOC, rural and underrepresented communities and groups in the state. The apprenticeship and Quick Start programs both support Intel's Rise 2030 Strategy, which aims to increase diversity and inclusion across the company's global workforce. ""Our RISE 2030 goals of increasing women in technical roles to 40% and doubling the numbers of women and underrepresented minorities in senior roles ties directly back to how we get people in the door,"" said Genesis Mullins, global government affairs and senior policy associate at Intel, ""and how we engage with employees and follow their success.""

697,0,The Times view on online disinformation: Antisocial Media,590 words,thetimes.co.uk,"This is becoming an all too familiar tale. We keep being told by the tech giants that they are merely platforms and cannot be expected to exercise control over everything that people choose to post on their sites. They insist that they should be treated differently from publishers, who are rightly held responsible for the content that they publish. Yet they are happy to act like publishers when collecting the fees from selling advertising against content on their website. In the case of YouTube, respected companies and organisations including Vodafone, Disney, Trainline and Amnesty have found their adverts placed by a Google algorithm alongside troubling videos.  YouTube insists that it has a policy of taking down videos that breach its guidelines. Yet some of the most troubling content had been on its site for months before YouTube removed it after being alerted by The Times . Besides, tech giants such as YouTube do not just make it easier to spread conspiracy theories but their business models in effect incentivise the creation of such content. Alex Belfield, an ex-BBC Radio 2 DJ who made a video about Sir Keir that went viral, receives an estimated Â£500,000 a year from his YouTube channel. Another channel, Rotten Politics, that promotes antivax content has 44,000 subscribers, netting about Â£9,000 a year in advertising revenues. Meanwhile there are reasons to be sceptical about how much effort tech giants are really willing to make to remove such content. Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee turned whistleblower, testified to the US Congress last year that the social networking site sets algorithms to maximise engagement even at the expense of exposing users to harmful content. The danger is that as tech giants come under commercial pressure from new entrants such as TikTok, they will be even more willing to turn a blind eye to what appears on their sites. Last week the value of Meta, Facebookâs parent, fell by $230 billion in a day, the biggest ever loss by a US company, after a slump in traffic. That prompted a promise of a switch to a greater focus on video. Social media has bought many benefits. But the failure of tech giants to take full responsibility for the content they publish is having real-world consequences. Today a convoy of antivaxers is threatening to descend on London in an attempt to emulate protests by truckers in Canada that have paralysed Ottawa for the past two weeks. It is further evidence of the extent to which conspiracy theories promoted via tech platforms are reaching global audiences. They could shut this content down if they wanted. It is time that they did."
203,0,"McDonald's , Starbucks to Close Russian Locations -- 2nd Update",950 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"The chief executives of McDonald's and Starbucks told employees in separate messages Tuesday that the moves were motivated by the invasion of Ukraine. U.S. companies have been reassessing their operations in Russia after Western governments sanctioned Russia in response to its military action, and financial firms acted to sever Russia from global markets. The restaurant companies' moves halt operations that have generated years of sales, serving millions of customers daily in a food-service market estimated to be worth billions of dollars. The suspensions are also a symbolic gesture by global brands that have in recent decades represented the opening of the Russian economy to Western-style business and products. Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month has built pressure on restaurant operators to follow steps by other major companies, including Apple Inc ., Boeing Co . and BP PLC , to reconsider their Russian ties. Since the invasion began, more than 250 U.S. technology firms, manufacturers and other companies have announced their withdrawal from Russia, according to the Yale School of Management. New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli , who oversees the state's public pension fund investments including McDonald's shares, had called on the company to review its Russian business to serve the best interests of the company and its shareholders, among them the New York State Common Retirement Fund . Online petitions have circulated on social media in recent days, calling for McDonald's and other U.S. restaurant chains to pull out of Russia.  McDonald's owns and operates 84% of its restaurants in Russia, with the rest run by franchisees, the chain said. It said that both company and franchised restaurants will temporarily shut down in the country. McDonald's said it couldn't yet tell when it might reopen the restaurants and would consider whether additional steps might be required. Russia and Ukraine accounted for around 9% of McDonald's revenue last year, the company said, given the high percentage of company-owned restaurants in those markets. The countries accounted for 2% of overall sales, and less than 3% of operating income, the chain said.  McDonald's also owns and operates 108 restaurants in Ukraine, along with corporate offices, employing nearly 10,000 people. Those locations are closed, and the company is working to maintain its payroll system in the country to keep paying employees, McDonald's said in an internal message last week.  Starbucks didn't specify when its Russia operations might restart. Other American restaurant chains are continuing some of their operations in Russia. A Yum! Brands Inc . spokeswoman said Tuesday that the company was suspending all investment and restaurant development in Russia, and that it was temporarily closing its 70 company-owned KFC locations and signing an agreement with its Pizza Hut franchisee to halt business at its 50 locations. The company has around 1,000 KFC restaurants in Russia, nearly all of which are operated by independent owners under license or franchise agreements and will continue to operate, Yum said. A Restaurant Brands International Inc . spokeswoman said the company's more than 800 Burger King restaurants remain open in Russia, as they are stand-alone businesses owned and operated by local franchisees. ""We have longstanding legal agreements that are not easily changeable in the foreseeable future,"" she said. In recent days, calls to boycott McDonald's , Starbucks and other chains still operating in Russia have grown on social media. Oksana Yakushko, a Santa Barbara, Calif.-based psychologist who is Ukrainian, said she started Change.org petitions calling for Starbucks and McDonald's to close their Russian locations because they struck her as more tangible than sanctions. ""Russia and Russians should not stay unaware or afraid to take responsibility for this war,"" said Ms. Yakushko, who said her immediate family had just escaped Ukraine, though other relatives remain. Some past efforts to pull back in response to geopolitical tensions have drawn rebukes from the Russian government. In 2014, amid rising tension over Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region, McDonald's closed a handful of restaurants operating there. In subsequent days, Russia's consumer regulator began shutting down or inspecting McDonald's restaurant locations, including the country's iconic first McDonald's restaurant that opened in Pushkin Square in 1990. The closures were temporary.  McDonald's first began eyeing the Russian market in the late 1970s, and it took repeated discussions with government officials to provide food for the 1980 Moscow Olympics and, later, open restaurants in the country. Running restaurants there involved extensive approvals from the Russian government. Some of McDonald's Russian locations eventually became among the chain's top-performing stores.  Pizza Hut , then owned by PepsiCo. Inc ., entered Russia soon after the first McDonald's opened. An advertisement starring former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev dishing up pizza in one of the chain's Moscow restaurants aired internationally in 1998, and came to symbolize Russia's opening up to capitalism.

817,0,AOC says Facebook and other US firms have 'sabotaged' the global response to Covid by spreading 'disinformation',982 words,Mail Online,"* She also accused Zuckerberg's platform of 'accelerating social violence' * The progressive lawmaker has one of the largest social media platforms of any US politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) has called for Facebook and other US firms to be 'broken up' for 'sabotaging' the global response to the Covid-19 pandemic by being complicit in spreading 'disinformation'. The Democratic Senator for New York also argued that the tech giant, which recently changed its name to Meta, should be subject to anti-trust action for its 'corrosive abuse of democracy' and role in 'contributing to and accelerating social violence'. Facebook and other social media goliaths like Twitter have been criticized over the past 18 months for providing a platform to spread what some perceive as false information about the virus. But there are numerous examples of the same social media networks introducing blanket, seemingly arbitrary bans on reputable scientists as well as politicians challenging the official response to Covid-19. The progressive lawmaker's latest tirade against Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook and other US firms comes a day after she returned to Twitter, having declared less than 24 hours before that she was taking a break from the platform due to 'negative comments that caused anxiety'. AOC has one of the largest social media followings of any US politician with close to 13 million followers on Twitter, 8.5 million followers on Instagram and over a million subscribers on Facebook. Facebook did not immediately respond to a MailOnline request for comment. The interview with Yahoo! Finance[https://finance-yahoo-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/news/aoc-facebook-sabotaged-the-global-covid-response-with-misinformation-180254381.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMiKNl_fgkQIQoRfHNJI8ZP3XdifW3f8t-bIMs1VgZdCgxKeAJ77bgwktY092lEasntWjQYL85XAFmIVA15_Aeyks3eWBxtaoMrYXL3x3K5L9cee4gipWqmSKMjr_JARprZzTFfM6vcUU5r0bNlFu0hYs9oYfxshxQtDemHzAD_U]'s Andy Serwer published last night saw AOC rip into Facebook and other unnamed 'US firms' for their handling of the pandemic. 'There are things we want the United States to stop exporting and one of those things is disinformation ï¿½?disinformation through US-founded companies like Facebook that have absolutely slowed and frankly sabotaged the global effort to fight against the coronavirus,' she declared. 'Facebook should be broken up,' the lawmaker continued. 'They're an advertiser. They are acting as both platform and vendor. They are a communication platform, which has historically been a well established domain of antitrust.' AOC drew ire for her Covid rhetoric just weeks ago when she was pictured maskless at multiple social engagements during a trip to Miami in Florida. Although Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed an executive order banning local government from enforcing face mask rules across the State, AOC has long campaigned for tougher restrictions and has argued that other states should adopt the wildly unpopular Covid measures currently in place in New York. It comes as a total of 72 percent of surveyed Americans say they are wary about how Facebook manages personal data in a poll that also reflects distrust of other social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and WhatsApp - with the latter two also owned by Facebook parent company Meta. Just 20 percent of people said they trust Facebook 'a great deal,' with another 72 percent of the 1,100 surveyed by The Washington Post expressing distrust of the social networking giant; eight percent of people did not offer an opinion. Meanwhile, former Facebook employee Frances Haugen in October 2021 leaked thousands of documents which showed that the social media giant had gathered extensive evidence of coronavirus misinformation on its platform, but chose not to disclose this to the public. Facebook spokesperson Aaron Simpson responded to the news in October, telling the Washington Post: 'There's no silver bullet to fighting misinformation, which is why we take a comprehensive approach which includes removing more than 20 million pieces of content that break our covid misinformation policies. '[Facebook] connects more than 2 billion people to reliable information about covid-19 and vaccines, and partnering with independent fact-checkers.' CEO Mark Zuckerberg also offered a sharp-elbowed response, refusing to apologize publicly and instead changing the company's name to Meta to highlight his focus on building a virtual reality metaverse. 'When our work is being mischaracterized, we're not going to apologize,' a Facebook spokesman told the Wall Street Journal. 'We're going to defend our record.' But Samidh Chakrabarti, who founded Facebook's civic-integrity team and left the company in September, became an outspoken critic on Twitter following the revelations. 'Meta's disingenuous spin of the FB Files as a partisan conspiracy isn't just incorrect, but is another example of short-term thinking,' he wrote. 'Might forestall regulation for now, but makes it harder to get new recruits to sign offers without some level of shame.' In November, Chakrabarti continued to criticize Facebook for its lack of transparency: It's been ~6 weeks since I left FB, and since then I've tried to bring deeper understanding to the complex issues the company faces. Some tweets have been supportive and others skeptical. But I now understand why so many ex-employees avoid saying anything vaguely critical.' Facebook's role in the distribution of Covid information was brought to the fore in July when Joe Biden accused social media platforms of 'killing people' through the spread of vaccine misinformation. At the time, Facebook VP Guy Rosen was quick to refute the accusation, arguing that vaccine acceptance among Facebook users had increased since the previous January and advocating instead for a 'whole of society' approach to ending the pandemic. Rosen bit back sharply, writing that '85 per cent of Facebook users in the US have been or want to be vaccinated against COVID-19. 'President Biden's goal was for 70% of Americans to be vaccinated by July 4. Facebook is not the reason this goal was missed.'"
113,0,Japan's COVID quasi-emergency likely to end in all 18 prefs.,335 words,Kyodo News,"Kishida has indicated that the government will take steps toward an ""exit"" from the anti-virus measures while securing sufficient vaccine doses, test kits and treatment drugs in preparation for possible infections driven new variants in the future. The 18 areas include the Tokyo metropolitan region including Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama, Aichi in central Japan, and Kyoto neighboring Osaka. While many people infected with the highly transmissible Omicron variant show no or mild symptoms, the spread of the BA.2 subvariant, which appears to be more contagious, has raised concern about a resurgence of cases that would stretch the health care system further. Under new government guidelines, a quasi-emergency can be lifted when the strain on the health care system is expected to ease despite infection numbers staying at high levels. Even when the occupancy rate of designated beds is above 50 percent, the government can end emergency steps if the number of newly confirmed cases is on a downtrend. Kishida is expected to hold a press conference later in the day to explain the government's view on the need for the quasi-emergency, government sources said. A formal decision on ending the measures is expected Thursday. ==Kyodo"

336,1,law debenture Market cap Â£1bn Dividend yield 3.6%,394 words,The Times,"Why? A professional services business, whose activities include providing trustee services to pension schemes and acting as an intermediary between corporate bond issuers and holders, which generates enough repeating revenue to give greater flexibility in the companies the trust invests in. Cash generated by the professional services business, which accounted for 21 per cent of net asset value (NAV) last year, has funded roughly 36 per cent of dividends over the past ten years. It is a formula that seems to be doing the trick in delivering both income and capital growth for investors. Last year the trust benefited from a recovery in both, generating a total return of 25 per cent, which beat the 6.8 per cent delivered by the FTSE All-Share Index, the benchmark. Even in 2020 Law Debenture increased its payment by almost 6 per cent. But the longer-term record is encouraging too. The trust has increased its dividend over the past 12 consecutive years and at least maintained that payment over the last 43. The dividend has grown at a compound annual growth rate of almost 12 per cent over the past five years. Even if this year's payment was kept flat on the prior year, it would still translate to a dividend yield of 3.6 per cent at the current share price.

557,1,Bulgaria's Smart Organic sees 10% growth in Q1 sales revenue,257 words,SeeNews - The Corporate Wire,"Sales growth was distributed comparatively evenly among the company's main channels, namely the home market, export markets and proprietary stores. Sales through the e-commerce channel, including Amazon.com, surged 97%, although they account for a modest 3% share of overall revenue. Alongside ongoing investments in expanding its product range and production base, Smart Organic is also exploring potential acquisition targets. The organic food manufacturer said it expects after late April to restart negotiations on the potential acquisition of an unnamed German competitor, which was in its sights in 2021 but negotiations stalled. The two parties have meanwhile struck a partnership, with Smart Organic completing its first delivery of a new health snack product for its German counterpart earlier this month, with plans to put it on the market in May. Shares in Smart Organic closed 2.44% lower at 16.0 levs on the Bulgarian Stock Exchange on Wednesday, for a market capitalisation of 169.1 million levs. (1 euro = 1.95583 levs)"
906,0,'Messi' of TV news enters BBC pressure cooker,1364 words,The Daily Telegraph,"""[Audiences] are relying on big brand newsrooms for information they could trust to protect their families,"" she added. ""There really is no higher purpose than that. It is like being at war. Where did audiences turn to then - they turned to our newsrooms."" Turness was setting out her stall to The Daily Telegraph in July as the new chief executive of ITN, the company behind the news programming for ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5. Fast-forward just six months and she is jumping ship to their biggest rival, taking on the toughest fight of her career. After a chaotic search, the 54-year-old has been confirmed as the BBC's head of news at a time of cultural tumult within its walls. The help cannot come soon enough for Tim Davie. Auntie's director general is trying to protect and reinforce the BBC's reputation amid a barrage of criticism from ministers linked to accusations of Left-wing bias, a failure to confront its shortcomings and concerns its corporate governance is being weakened by ""group-think"". Rancour is also building among BBC staff over Â£408m of cuts hollowing out the newsroom as an incoming financial settlement on the Â£159 licence fee is expected to bring greater budgetary pressure. And, as autocratic regimes including Russia and China dial up investment in state-funded broadcasters, Turness must wage an international battle to secure the BBC's future as an impartial global news provider. In a statement on Thursday, Turness burnished the BBC's international profile, saying it was a ""great privilege"" to lead and grow the broadcaster when ""its content is reaching more global consumers on more platforms than ever before"". It underscored Auntie's value as one of Britain's biggest global soft powers, with the BBC hoping to become a panacea for tech giants as pressure mounts on them to stem disinformation. Yet it is far from the only organisation making a pitch for global dominance of trusted journalism. The New York Times' $550m (Â£450m) acquisition of subscription sports site The Athletic creates a global challenger for the BBC website, which makes money from advertising overseas. Competition for talent is also likely to become more fierce. Supporters are backing Turness to succeed. ITV News business and economics editor Joel Hills tweeted: ""The BBC has just signed Messi. The bad news is it's from us."" Others believe she needs to sharpen her approach. An ITN insider says: ""She had 10 ideas a day, some brilliant, some frankly embarrassing. At ITN the horrible ones mostly never got noticed, but she won't have that leeway at the BBC."" Those knowledgeable of Turness's management approach say she is ""collegiate but decisive"" with a ""gentle but firm"" style. In her notable broadcasting career she became the first, and youngest, female editor of ITV News before moving stateside as president of NBC News International. Before rejoining ITN last year, she spearheaded the launch of NBC Sky  World News - a global brand designed to challenge the BBC and CNN - before the idea was abandoned by parent Comcast when advertising sales plunged during the pandemic. ""She ticks a lot of boxes,"" a BBC source says, referring to her global broadcasting experience. Davie certainly seemed determined to land her as the successor to Fran Unsworth, who oversaw a turbulent four years marred by intense scrutiny of management following Lord Dyson's damning report of Martin Bashir's 1995 interview with Diana, Princess of Wales. Confirmation of Turness in the Â£400,000-a-year position brought a close to a seemingly scatter-gun process after she initially turned it down. Today programme presenter Nick Robinson was linked to the position last month, according to The Mail on Sunday. He joined a string of media heavyweights such as John McAndrew, former head of news programming at GB News, and Kevin Bakhurst, Ofcom's group director of content and media policy. Turness also beat internal favourite Jonathan Munro, deputy director of  BBC News and head of news content, who became drawn into the Bashir scandal after praising the journalist when he was reappointed in 2016. Among Turness's early challenges will be choosing a new political editor to replace Laura Kuenssberg, a decision that will be closely monitored by Downing Street. Nadine Dorries, the Culture Secretary, inflamed the Government's impartiality row with the BBC in November when she criticised Kuenssberg's reporting as ridiculous after the journalist quoted an anonymous Tory MP, who claimed Boris Johnson's authority was ""evaporating"". It won't take long before her mettle is tested. BBC managers are renowned for facing public criticism. In November, for instance, an internal backlash ensued after the BBC decided to pull out of the workplace equality scheme led by LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall. Concerns that the BBC is no longer impartial have caused eight trans staff to leave, according to a report by Vice News. The broadcaster responded that it was ""fully committed to be an industry-leading employer on LGBTQ+ inclusion"". Lord Grade, who is part of a panel reviewing public service broadcasters, believes Turness must tackle the BBC's propensity to defend mistakes. ""When they have got something wrong, they need to own up immediately,"" he says. ""It's a shocking habit and it is a sign of weakness, not strength, and it drives me crazy. They are not very good at admitting to mistakes quickly."" The most immediate test will come at the end of this month when the BBC is expected to finalise a five-year deal with ministers to freeze or increase the licence fee at just below inflation. That could prove costly as the broadcaster's budget comes under pressure from American streaming giants whose appetite for making shows in Britain is pushing production costs higher. Roger Mosey, former head of BBC Television News, says Auntie was pleased to have the chance to negotiate with the Government after previous settlements were ""sprung"" on it. But he fears the outcome could demand more cost-cutting when there is no more fat on the bone to trim. ""The savings they have now made in BBC News are pretty serious and draconian,"" he says. ""If the BBC is squeezed financially still more, then you will really notice the results - it is not crying wolf any more."" For Turness, there has never been a ""greater need for the BBC's powerful brand of impartial and trusted journalism"". But leading the charge as the purse strings tighten will be a battle few leaders want to face. Blow for team ITN Broadcaster left to fill the gap ITN's efforts to shore-up its under pressure finances has hit a bout of turbulence in the departure of its chief executive. The company is attempting to burnish its commercial credentials in events and programme production, while staving off a threat of insurgent broadcaster GB News and Rupert Murdoch's TALKTV. Deborah Turness picked up from her predecessor Anna Mallett, who was diversifying the business to become less reliant on live news before departing for Netflix in April. The potential privatisation of Channel 4, meanwhile, has only sought to sharpen ITN's focus on diversifying its income given the uncertainty a new owner might bring. Revenues and pre-tax profits at ITN fell by a respective 11pc to Â£121m, and 54pc to Â£1.1m for the year to December 2020, amid rising costs and production sector disruption.

293,0,"Vaccine pass already hurting business at struggling Hong Kong restaurants just hours after launch, industry representative says",1340 words,scmp.com,"The launch of the governmentâs vaccine pass scheme has proved to be yet another blow to Hong Kongâs already struggling restaurants, with one industry representative reporting an immediate drop in revenue and patrons being turned away for failing to comply with the new rules. Ray Chui Man-wai, chairman of Kam Kee Holdings, which operates 44 restaurants, said his groupâs business was already down by 40 per cent following the schemeâs introduction on Thursday morning, blaming the vaccine pass and a newly lowered cap on the number of diners per table for dampening peopleâs desire to eat out. âThere are quite a number of diners who still donât know how to use the vaccine pass. They think they only need to scan their âLeave Home Safeï¿½?app, but in fact they need to scan their vaccination record separately,ï¿½?he said. âOur staff need to assist them one by one.ï¿½?Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge [https://www.scmp.com/knowledge], our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Under the scheme, people aged 12 and above must show proof of having received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine [https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/coronavirus-vaccine] to enter government venues and 23 other types of premises, including restaurants, shopping centres, wet markets and supermarkets. Residents must also register their visit on the governmentâs âLeave Home Safeï¿½?risk-exposure app. Chui, who is also the chairman of the industry group Institute of Dining Art, said about 10 per cent of would-be diners on Thursday morning had been barred from entering restaurants as they had forgotten to upload their vaccination record to âLeave Home Safeï¿½? âMost of them were elderly people,ï¿½?he said. âThey had no idea that they needed to save their vaccination records in their app, and felt very frustrated.ï¿½?In Causeway Bay, restaurants, supermarkets and wet markets were unusually subdued on Thursday morning, with patrons few and far between. At Wealthy Garden, a Chinese restaurant in the area, only half the usual number of customers showed up for breakfast on Thursday morning, according to an employee who declined to be named. âThat means that we might lose 50 per cent of the revenue,ï¿½?she said, adding that the restaurant was popular with seniors, many of whom still had not been vaccinated ï¿½?though she allowed the cold weather could have also played a part. Rather than the large, chatty groups commonly seen at dim sum brunches, the restaurantâs 20 or so customers were spread out in quiet ones and twos to comply with social-distancing rules. Many were still wearing protective gear, such as double masks and eye protection. The restaurant worker said she did not have any issues scanning the vaccination codes of the diners who did turn up. Among them was a 72-year-old surnamed Tsang, who said the vaccine pass was a necessary measure in the fight against Covid-19. âOnly when the pandemic has ended can we get back to a normal life,ï¿½?he said, adding that the new arrangement did not cause him any inconvenience. But not everyone was so sanguine about the new rules. Wang, a 82 year-old housewife, was frustrated after being denied entry to a supermarket on Thursday morning. âI canât go anywhere without the vaccine pass now,ï¿½?she said. Though her son previously helped her install âLeave Home Safeï¿½? Wang was not aware it was now needed to get into supermarkets, and had left her phone at home. Wang said she had not yet been vaccinated, and was worried not only about catching the virus, but also being barred from the places where she shopped for food. âI didnât have a clear answer from my doctor about whether I am fit for vaccination due to my chronic conditions,ï¿½?she said. Those with a valid medical excuse for not being jabbed are exempt from using the vaccine pass, but they must provide a doctorâs certificate. All venue employees must also be fully inoculated as part of the scheme, though they can also claim a medical exemption with a doctorâs certificate. Residents can either present their paper vaccine certificate or upload an electronic one to âLeave Home Safeï¿½?or other government apps to create a QR code as proof of inoculation. âLeave Home Safeï¿½?is required for entering restaurants anyway. Data stored by the app is encrypted and will be automatically erased after 31 days. Machines installed at restaurants to scan QR codes will notify staff with various sound alerts as to whether a patronâs inoculation or exemption record is valid. Exceptions to the scheme will include entering a venue to buy takeaway or retrieve belongings, getting tested or vaccinated, attending government, legal or medical appointments, or commuting home or to work. Certain premises, such as restaurants and clubhouses, will also require staff to actively check patronsï¿½?inoculation or exemption records, while customers must scan a QR code before entering. Venues such as malls, supermarkets, department stores and wet markets will only be subject to passive checks ï¿½?consisting of providing vaccination records when asked by law enforcement officers. However, a Cantonese restaurant with more than 60 years of business on Tuesday said it would close its doors for two weeks from Thursday, as it could not complete preparations for the vaccine pass on time. âNo vaccination, no business, no life,ï¿½?said Alan Yan Cheuk-lun, owner of Man Shing Restaurant in Tai Hang. Yan said he, his 64-year-old mother and his two brothers, who all operate the restaurant together, could not get vaccinated for medical reasons. âIt is time for us to take a rest and have our body checks,ï¿½?he said. A government spokesman said restaurant staff with a certified medical exemption should undergo Covid-19 testing every seven days, while those without one would need to get their shots to return to work. The cityâs shopping malls have been gearing up for the scheme by conducting drills, displaying notices at entrances and playing government promotional videos on their premises. Rail giant the MTR Corporation, which operates a number of shopping centres across the city, said it had adopted several measures to ensure the smooth implementation of the vaccine pass, including sending letters to tenants to remind them to abide by the schemeâs requirements. âWe shall implement the arrangements at MTR malls with our best endeavours including ï¿½?displaying clear and sufficient notices at the entrances/exits of the malls to allow the public to comply with the relevant laws and regulations, and showing the governmentâs promotional videos on the vaccine pass in our malls,ï¿½?it said. On Thursday, a photo being widely shared on social media showed a gigantic two-metre âLeave Home Safeï¿½?QR code being displayed at the Maritime Square mall attached to the Tsing Yi MTR station.  Link Reit, Asiaâs largest real estate investment trust, which runs 75 malls in Hong Kong, said it had conducted five drills across its shopping centres in Wong Tai Sin, Sha Tin, Tin Shui Wai and Tung Chung since last Thursday for tenants to get familiarised with the rules. It added that it would deploy extra staff at high-traffic mall entrances on Thursday to assist visitors with scanning the âLeave Home Safeï¿½?QR code. A spokeswoman for Sino Group said the company had posted signs at entrances and prominent locations, and that additional staff would be added to assist patrons at its malls."
404,1,Water output to be amped up close to 1k MGD this year,711 words,Hindustan Times,"""The targeted production from the nine water treatment plants will be pushed up to 861MGD instead of last year's peak summer production of 845 MGD. The extraction of water from sub-surface resources, such as ranney wells and tubewells, will be 137MGD -- an addition of 47 MGD over last year,"" said a senior DJB official. A senior DJB official said that the number of operational tubewells will be raised to 5,263 -- an increase of 471 -- to meet the increased target, adding that the water will be sustainably extracted from areas having high ground water level and located along the Yamuna floodplains or water treatment plants with high natural recharge. The groundwater contribution to Delhi's water supply was 86MGD in 2020 and 90MGD in 2021. According to the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB), water in most parts of Delhi is already in the ""overexploited"" category, meaning there is more extraction than there is recharge. Its latest annual report for 2020-21, released in August 2021, claims that large parts of groundwater in Delhi was also found to have high salinity levels and had the presence of heavy metals such as iron, manganese and even uranium beyond the permissible limits. The economic survey released by the Delhi government on March 25, 2022 states that the water treatment capacity of the DJB, which had remained largely stagnant at 906MGD between 2014 to 2018, has witnessed growth over the last three years with the largest spike over the last one year. ""The water production is also being gradually raised by reducing water leakage losses, increasing the performance levels of water treatment plant by replacing filters, old pumps and also shoring up the sub-surface water resources,"" said the official. DJB operates nine water treatment plants in the city at Wazirabad, Chandrawal, Haiderpur, Nangloi, Okhla, Dwarka, Bawana, Bhagirathi and Sonia Vihar. ""The optimisation has led to increase of production by 5MGD each in Chandrawal and Haiderpur water treatment plants while the other units will increase output by 1-2 MGD,"" said the official. The latest outcome budget of the DJB states that the water utility has been able to save 4MGD of water due to repair of 2,955km of old and defective pipelines till December 2021. While the piped water supply has been extended to 1,642 unauthorised colonies, the water utility has also identified 10,141 daily fixed water supply points where tankers will be deployed. ""Between April and July 2022 period, 1,198 water tanker will remain on duty. DJB has 250 stainless steel water tankers, 407 units have been contracted and another 541 have been hired for summer action plan... The vulnerable points have been identified in consultation with the local MLAs,"" the official explained. Manoj Misra, who heads Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, said that such water extraction points can be developed in the active floodplain areas where natural recharge can occur but the water utility should not extend it to the non-floodplain zones. ""The concern mainly is regarding the quality of water and there should be constant monitoring of the contaminants in the water being extracted. In Sonia Vihar or Palla floodplains, chances of contamination are low but the DJB should still monitor the level of insecticide contamination due to agricultural activities on floodplains,"" he added.

McDonald's Corp, among the first major restaurant chains to report fourth quarter results, is expected to report a 6.9% increase in U.S. comparable sales growth, down slightly from estimates of 7% two weeks ago. It reported 9.6% growth in the third quarter. The chain's U.S. menu prices have increased 2.7% over the last three months, according to Gordon Haskett analysts. Some McDonald's franchisees now say more expensive sandwiches are hurting foot traffic and sales, according to independent analyst Mark Kalinowski's survey of operators, published Monday. ""Is there an inflection point at which customers start deciding it's not worth paying $9.50 for a burrito, it's not worth paying $7 for a hamburger?"" said Morningstar analyst Sean Dunlop. Weekly visits to many fast-food restaurants have been falling in recent weeks, according to Placer.ai, which tracks cell phone location data. McDonald's visits started dropping in mid-December and fell 12.6% in the week ended Jan. 10 versus 2019 levels, the analytics firm said. And fast-food menu prices could increase another 6% to 8% in 2022, according to Wedbush Securities. To be sure, consumers have had pent-up spending power after saving money at the start of the pandemic and later getting cash injections from government rescue aid. Several chains including Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and Popeyes' parent company Restaurant Brands International Inc have so far reported little resistence to higher menu prices. ""We haven't seen much pushback yet on the price taken in 2021,"" Restaurant Brands CEO Jose Cil said during an investor conference on Monday. ""The key is not to get too far ahead of the consumer."" Restaurants face multiple pressures including COVID-related staffing shortages, limited seating and reduced hours on top of bad winter weather and normally slow January sales.  McDonald's is expected to use its new digital rewards program to grab market share from smaller rivals, including Restaurant Brands' Burger King.  McDonald's huge scale lets it ""defray the costs of really heavy investments in technology across an enormous sales base and swallow those costs better than a lot of smaller peers,"" Dunlop said.

174,1,Russia - Institutions and Energy Policy - Gas,424 words,Global Energy Research,"Under the second and third phases of the reform, the transport and production activities within Gazprom will be legally separated and the market fully liberalised. However, due to the ongoing market conditions, the reform was postponed.  Gazprom's monopoly on LNG exports was removed in 2013 and LNG export rights were granted in 2014 to Rosneft and Yamal LNG (Novatek and Total). The Russian Tax Code of 2015 increased the mineral extraction tax rate applied to Gazprom by 20% over 2016 and 2017, and by a further 12% in 2019 to 8.5Â RUB/t (US13c/t). This tax increase is aimed at raising federal revenues in a context of low international oil prices. In January 2021, the tax has been modified to be multiplied by 3 for a list of rare minerals. In 2020, the Ministries of Energy and Finance agreed to a series of measures to boost energy development in the Arctic, such as tax relief for new oil and gas fields, offshore production, and LNG projects. The country is seeking to further explore Arctic oil and gas reserves (10 Gt of currently uneconomically viable reserves equivalent to US$4Â 000bn) before the western Siberia reserves decline. A tax reform would also improve producer margins to better compete with US shale producers, where production costs are higher, but where producers benefit from cheap credit and taxes. In March 2021, the government adopted the Long-Term Program on the Development and Production of LNG. The document highlights the strategic role of the Arctic region in the pursuit of country's main goal -gaining a 20% share in the global LNG industry by 2035. Last Updated: 20220101"

502,1,"Wall Street Trades Up, for Now; Banks delivered excellent trading results, but capital considerations might put damper on party",781 words,The Wall Street Journal Online,"Trading desks at Wall Street banks look set to keep delivering strong results, so long as their bosses give them the opportunity. In the first quarter, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley both grew trading revenue 4% from a year earlier. Trading revenue at Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase was down just 2% and 3%, respectively. Given some of the gloomy forecasts for trading[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/wall-street-might-not-be-such-a-drag-this-earnings-season-11649688848] earlier this year, and the difficult comparison with a very strong quarter in the year-earlier period, it seems that March's market recovery had a big effect. It also suggests that volatility around Russia's invasion of Ukraine[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/russias-black-sea-fleet-flagship-damaged-evacuated-after-ukraine-claims-missile-strike-11649920914], tightening by the Federal Reserve and other factors are driving investors to make market moves, rather than just stepping away entirely. Much of the talk around big banks in recent years has focused on diversification toward steady fee-earning businesses such as wealth management and payments. That is because for years, the variability of Wall Street earnings has weighed on banks' share valuations. Investors are conditioned to question and fear whether trading revenues are sustainable, and whether bouts of volatility can lead to prints of big losses. This uncertainty leads many analysts to assign a lower price-to-earnings multiples to bank earnings, and to build in some discount on their book values. But count this as another quarter that suggests that the evolution of the business after the global financial crisis and the Volcker rule might have changed the game a bit. And the first quarter, in particular, might have shown that commodity volatility could, on balance, be an opportunity for trading desks. Banks still don't often give many details on the commodities component of fixed-income, currency and commodities trading, known as FICC. But Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said on a Thursday call with reporters that its commodities revenues more than doubled in the first quarter from a year ago. Goldman Sachs called out ""significantly higher net revenues in currencies and commodities."" Morgan Stanley described commodities revenues as ""notably higher than the previous first quarter, benefiting from the heightened levels of activity."" Though Russia's invasion of Ukraine[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/ukraine-russia-war-invasion-whats-happening-11646157211] presented some extraordinary events[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/chaotic-commodity-markets-spill-over-into-real-world-11649771900] in commodities markets, banks' role in ""helping clients manage volatility in energy and carbon prices"" could create a lasting revenue opportunity, according to a recently published yearly research report by analysts at Morgan Stanley and consultants at Oliver Wyman. The report notes that banks' commodities trading revenues rose from about $6 billion in 2019 to $12 billion in 2020 and 2021. The report argues that this upswing can run for at least another year or two, representing a meaningful increase from the 2019 baseline. Likewise, the authors expect that changing monetary policies globally could spur industry revenue growth in what is known as ""macro"" trading, like around rates and currencies, at times over the next couple of years. The challenge in the future is whether banks can lean into trading opportunities without committing vastly more of their capital resources[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/as-banks-face-omicron-risk-their-size-could-become-a-handicap-11638360001] or putting significantly more of their balance sheet at risk. With Goldman the exception, the other global Wall Street banks reporting so farâCitigroup, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanleyâall saw their first-quarter ratios of risk-weighted assets to common equity Tier 1 capital, a key regulatory measure, decline from a year earlier. There were several drivers of this trend, but a meaningful factor was a rise in risk-weighted assets related to market volatility. With those capital ratios now in some cases edging closer to minimum requirements set by Washington, banks might have to start making some choices. If bank stocks don't fall too much, the returns on offer in trading might be attractive enough to justify shrinking buybacks to make more resources available for trading desks. Either that or trading desks will have keep finding ways to get more efficient[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/wall-street-banks-do-more-with-less-11618416569] with the capital they already have allocated. If bank stocks keep up the declines seen so far this year, perhaps buying back shares at cheap price-to-book ratios generates a better return.

So I think, at this early stage, we don't anticipate whether that will be this year or early next year.""  Citigroup announced in January that it would seek to divest its retail banking operations in Mexico, where the bank has its largest branch network in the world.

320,1,Mediating Employment Disputes: Between A Clock And A Hard Case,925 words,Mondaq Business Briefing,"Mediations are being used to pull on the thread to unravel disparate realities and underlying causes. Many recent employment cases involve corporate policies regarding vaccinations. Those most affected by these policies are minorities, specifically those living in underserved communities. Statistics show that residents of these communities don't trust COVID vaccines for a variety of reasons, but they need to keep their jobs in order to feed their families. There is also the overlapping issue of these same people having less access to quality health care and mental health resources at a time when, for some, these services are needed more than ever before. Virtual or hybrid working arrangements are reportedly not being considered in a way that accounts for employees who live in marginalized communities (support and administrative staff) across industries. In many cases, these employees travel farther to get to work, sometimes on public transportation, and they have to pay (the same) high child care costs. They need to work and can't afford after-school care, so they rely on family to defray the cost of child care. Additionally, these employees tend to have jobs that are not computer-based, so they cannot perform them remotely. Equality and Access The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) recently released updated guidelines that allow employers to mandate vaccinations in the interest of creating a safer workplace environment. There are exemptions for employees who have certain religious beliefs or qualifying medical conditions outlined by the Americans with Disabilities Act. The exemptions apply unless granting the exemption would cause an undue hardship on the employer under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The EEOC's guidelines prioritize public safety over an individual's choice to be vaccinated. Work environments affect homes; homes affect communities; communities affect the world. While the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic can be seen all over the world, there are disparities in access to resources and health care in underserved communities. For many alternative dispute resolution (ADR) providers, providing equal access to justice means considering and acting upon diverse interests. It also means building resources around courts' ADR programs to foster an environment of trust. Responsibility In my conversations with colleagues and in publications, it is reported that across industries, companies are bringing employees back to the office in waves. Many employers are making accommodations for employees with underlying health conditions. Some companies have dropped their mask mandates as well as their vaccine mandates, but there are risks associated with these decisions. The overarching guidance is focused on how to accommodate the fear of returning to work, as well as the reality that COVID is so unpredictable and contagious. Employers have obligations and responsibilities to their employees and to the public. Having employees who are infected and/or spreading infections can be a source for increased virus transmission in the community. Employers' responses to these challenges are likely to be seen, in some cases, as retaliation, and there is a recent rise in these allegations. Realities There are disparate conditions that exist in marginalized communities that can create a snowball effect when employment (and other) instability is in play. There seems to be job insecurity in some industries, yet many businesses are short-staffed. This is an odd reality. Responses to the needs of employees and customers are ever-evolving. In the hospitality industry, for instance, even in large hotel chains, staff must balance cleaning rooms according to COVID protocols with the expectations of guests. Some guests may prefer only to have their towels changed out, while others may want a full room cleaning each day. The restaurant industry is experiencing its own challenges. Owners, especially those of smaller establishments, are having difficulty getting some of the ingredients they need to prepare their offerings. This has caused menu revisions and, in some cases, changes to hours of operation. This has a domino effect on staffing, as fewer hours open means fewer staff needed. Single-parent households and those who live in poorer communities are more susceptible to the effects of this situation. It seems that the more we learn about the coronavirus, the more we see that there is still much we do not know. With regard to the endemicity of COVID (it is here to stay), experts agree that there is no way to know when we might reach herd immunity or how the virus will evolve.

988,1,"TSMC's Q1 net profit hits new high, gross margin beats forecast",521 words,Central News Agency English News,"The company's first-quarter gross margin -- the difference between revenue and the cost of goods sold -- was 55.6 percent, beating its forecast of between 53.0 percent and 55.0 percent.  ""The first-quarter earnings per share also surpassed an earlier market estimate of NT$7.3 to NT$7.4,"" Mega International Investment Services Corp. analyst Alex Huang noted. ""For TSMC, there were no slow season effects at all in the first quarter.""  Globally, the semiconductor industry usually reports a quarterly drop in first-quarter earnings and sales, as it is a slow period in that sector.  For TSMC, however, its consolidated sales rose by a quarterly 11.6 percent in the first quarter to US$17.57 billion, beating its previous guidance of US$16.6 billion to US$17.2 billion. The first quarter revenue also rose 36 percent from a year earlier.  ""Strong global demand for emerging technologies led to full capacity utilization at TSMC,"" Huang said. ""In addition, the chipmaker benefited from a weaker Taiwan dollar in the first quarter, as it converted its sales into the local currency.""  The company's sales forecast in mid-January was based on an exchange rate of NT$27.6 against the U.S. dollar, but the rate fell to NT$28.622 at the end of March.  According to TSMC, its sales of chips for high performance computing devices and automotive electronics rose by a quarterly 26 percent in the first three months of the year, while sales of chips for consumer electronics grew 8 percent, and those for Internet of Things gadgets increased 5 percent.  Sales of smartphone chips, however, rose only 1 percent from the previous quarter, amid a slowdown in demand for smartphones, the company reported.  Chips on TMSC's advanced 7 nanometer and 5nm processes accounted for 30 percent and 20 percent of its first-quarter sales, respectively, compared with 27 percent and 23 percent in the previous quarter, the company said.  The 5nm process is TSMC's latest technology in commercial production, and its 3nm process is scheduled to go into mass production in the second half of this year, while the company is developing the 2nm process.  In the first quarter, TSMC's operating margin -- the difference between sales, the cost of goods sold and operating expenses -- stood at 45.6 percent, topping its forecast of 42.0 percent to 44.0 percent, according to the report.

877,1,The Unlikely Sales Stars On Your Team,597 words,Inc. Magazine,"Create a culture of selling. The fastest growing companies are ones where everyone takes an active role in growing the business. From the person answering the phones to the CEO, and everyone in between. There is a company culture of selling whenever possible. This begins by helping everyone on your team see that a culture of selling benefits everyone- it helps create opportunity, security and stability for all team members, regardless of their official title. Share stories of team members that upsold to customers, and help celebrate victories company wide. Start small. One of the easiest ways to get your team on board is through the practice of recommendations. Anyone that has shopped at Trader Joe's is probably familiar with this technique. The cashier will often share their recommendations based on the contents of your cart, or are quick to point out the products in your basket that they have personally tried and loved. Such a simple and natural thing for an employee to do can be a very powerful sales tool when used properly. And the pressure to ""close"" the sale is very low, so even the most apprehensive team members can adopt this technique with ease. Practice ""Lead Spotting."" Another way to increase your sales across the board is to get collectively better at lead spotting. This is where you begin to notice signals that a prospect is either ready to buy or is looking for an upgrade or an additional product. Train your team to start asking the right questions in everyday interactions and then give them a process to turn those leads over to another team member to follow up and close the sale. This will not only increase the number of leads your sales team gets, but gives your entire team a chance to participate actively in the sales process regardless of their title. Practice the elevator pitch. Your sales team knows the pitch by heart. But when someone asks your IT person in the elevator who they work for, do you have any idea what they say? Don't leave this one to chance. Instead write up a script and practice it with your entire team often. We use something like this: Formula: ""You know how __[insert #1 biggest pain point of your target market that you solve]___, what we do is ___[insert your biggest solution and benefit to that pain point]___."" It's simple, it's to the point and helps everyone get on the same page. With a little bit of practice, everyone can become a sales person in your company. By focusing on a selling culture, starting small, lead spotting and practicing your elevator pitches you may be surprised at who can become the unlikely sales star on your team.

249,0,Job fears as Sainsburyâs plans to shut 200 cafes in shake-up of in-store dining,358 words,The Herald,"It is the latest in a raft of recent restructuring moves by the retailer as it seeks to keep a lid on rising costs. Sainsburyâs told staff at its cafes yesterday morning that it is proposing to close 200 sites in the spring. It said that workers affected by the closures will be prioritised for vacant roles in stores and will be encouraged to apply for jobs elsewhere in the business. The remaining 67 in-store cafes will stay open while the company reviews changes to its dining operations. Its decision to close the cafes is a part of a wider move to transform its dining, takeaway and home delivery food and drink offer from stores. The retailer said it will also open 30 more restaurant hubs in stores in partnership with Boparan Restaurant Group (BRG), which runs the Caffe Carluccioâs, Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Edâs Diner and Slim Chickens brands. It said the move comes after a successful trial partnership at its Selly Oak supermarket in Birmingham. The supermarket business said it will also open 30 Starbucks sites across its supermarkets, as it seeks to overhaul its offer across 250 stores over the next three years. Yesterday, the group also confirmed the closure of further hot food counters and changes to bakery operations at some sites. It did not specify the number of jobs impacted. In April last year, Sainsburyâs said 1,200 jobs were at risk from plans to stop baking products in some stores, while it cut around 3,500 jobs due to the closure of fresh meat and fish counters in November 2020."

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge[https://www.scmp.com/knowledge], our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. The annual report, filed to the Hong Kong stock exchange, did not provide financial data for East Dawning, which was established by Yum on the mainland in 2005. The chain kicked off with about 100 restaurants nationwide located mainly at airports and train stations. But the number has fallen drastically over the years amid stiff competition. By 2012, the chain had dwindled to 30 restaurants, and by 2020 only eight outlets of the brand remained. ï¿½?Disease outbreak dealt a fatal blow[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3168563/coronavirus-cafe-de-coral-among-hong-kong] to the brand, but it has not been successful over the past decade due to stern challenges from a raft of local restaurant chains,ï¿½?said Chen Xiao, CEO of Shanghai Yacheng Culture, a consultancy dealing with marketing and branding for foreign and local companies. âAfter all, the five outlets and the brand are of little value to Yumâs businesses in China.ï¿½?East Dawning, in Chinese, literally means that the east is lit up by the light of dawn. Su Shi, a poet during the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127) wrote in his poem the Red Cliffs that a group of friends were so obsessed with a dinner party on a boat that they did not notice the east was lit up by the light of dawn. East Dawning was the first Chinese-style fast-food brand created by Yum to tap the market potential on the mainland. It combines KFCâs business model with Chinese cuisine. The menu includes steamed pastries such as buns, and Chinese tea. The fast-food brand has been eclipsed by the rise of Chinese restaurant chains such as Da Niang Dumpling and Yangâs Dumplings which are adept at cooking Chinese food to appeal to local tastes. Chinaâs catering sector has taken a beating from the coronavirus outbreak over the past two years as lockdown measures and social distancing rules have kept customers at bay. In 2020, restaurants across the mainland reported total revenue of 3.95 trillion yuan (US$625 billion), down 15.4 per cent on the year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. In the first half of 2021, the catering industry raked in sales of 2.17 trillion yuan, up 48.6 per cent from a year ago, but virtually unchanged from the same period of 2019.  Yum China, whose other brands include Little Sheep, Huang Ji Huang and Coffii & Joy, operates more than 11,700 outlets on the mainland. It reported net profit of US$525 million in 2021, down 15 per cent from the previous year. Revenue grew 19 per cent to US$9.85 billion. Its shares trading in Hong Kong were changing hands at HK$378 (US$48.37) on Monday afternoon, having slumped 8 per cent from their initial public offering price of HK$412 in September, 2020."

And on Thursday night the French leader discussed with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ways to âidentify elements that could lead to de-escalation,ï¿½?and âconditions for strategic balance in Europe, which should allow for the reduction of risks on the ground and guarantee security on the continent.ï¿½?While France is a major player in NATO and is moving troops to Romania as part of the allianceâs preparation for possible Russian action, Macron has also been actively pushing for dialogue with Putin and has spoken to him several times in recent weeks.

102,1,Big banks flex strength in commercial lending,791 words,American Banker,"âWe are seeing a pronounced pick-up,ï¿½?said Cheryl Pate, a portfolio manager at Angel Oak Capital Advisors, comparing the recent increase in commercial lending to past periods of rapid growth after a recession. At Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, executives said the commercial loan growth reflects strength across many subcategories. They also said they expect further momentum as businesses invest in growth to meet pent-up demand from the pandemic. The commercial loan growth during the first quarter reflected slowing paydowns, increased business activity and higher utilization rates across most sectors and geographies, Chief Financial Officer Terry Dolan said Thursday during a call with analysts. Dolan noted that sentiment among business clients is positive and stable, and he said that borrowers are using loan proceeds to build inventory, make capital expenditures, and enter into mergers and acquisitions. Asked about the impact of inflation on business investment [https://www-americanbanker-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/news/bok-financial-warns-of-50-million-securities-loss-tied-to-inflation-war] ï¿½?following news this week that inflation reached a four-decade high in March ï¿½?Dolan said that higher costs are fueling near-term investments in technology. Businesses that are grappling with labor shortages and higher salary costs are investing in tech to create efficiencies and offset wage inflation, he said. âItâs going to be important to automate as much as we possibly can,ï¿½?Dolan said in an interview, referring to businesses across industries. âAt least in the near term, capital expenditure will continue to be reasonably strong.ï¿½?At the $587 billion-asset parent company of U.S. Bank, commercial loans fueled an advance in total loans of more than 3%. âThis might wind up being some of the best commercial loan growth that we see on a linked-quarter basis,ï¿½?said Mike Mayo, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities.  U.S. Bancorpâs net interest income rose nearly 2% from the previous quarter to $3.2 billion. For the full year, the company projected 8% to 11% growth in interest income, reflecting both loan growth and rising interest rates [https://www-americanbanker-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/news/bank-earnings-to-spotlight-rising-interest-rates-and-costs]. Federal Reserve policymakers raised their benchmark rate in March and forecasted several more hikes this year. At least some bank clients will likely look to borrow in the near term to avoid paying higher rates down the road, potentially providing another boost to loan demand this year, Dolan said. âI expect people will be trying to get ahead of it,ï¿½?he said in the interview. At Wells Fargo, executives said that demand for commercial loans continues to rise more than two years into the pandemic. Quarterly commercial loan volumes were flat or slightly down earlier in 2021, but they started to rebound in the fourth quarter of last year, and that trend accelerated during the first quarter of 2022. Between January and March, average loans in Wells Fargoâs commercial bank grew to $194.4 billion, up from $184.6 billion three months earlier. Larger clients drove a sizable chunk of the increase, as companies built back their inventories, and inflation led to higher costs for transportation and materials, Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo said during a call with analysts. The $1.9 trillion-asset bank is also seeing commercial customers use credit to fund longer-term expansion plans, including some businesses that are âcatching upï¿½?on capital expenditures after keeping them low during the earlier stages of the pandemic, Santomassimo said. In addition, companies are tapping their revolving lines of credit more, though utilization rates remain below prepandemic levels, he said. At JPMorgan, average total commercial loans rose to $210.7 billion in the quarter, up by about 2% compared with both the fourth quarter of 2021 and the year-ago quarter. Citigroup, whose corporate loans in North America rose to $129.2 billion, reported similar percentage increases. PNC's commercial loans rose to $195.6 billion on average last quarter, up 1% from the prior quarter and 19% from a year earlier. The jump was partly due to companies' higher capital expenditures, inventory buildups and usage of revolving credit lines, PNC Chief Executive Bill Demchak said Thursday during a call with analysts. The industrywide uptick in commercial lending is an indication that âdespite increasing uncertainty, the economy is still fairly strong,ï¿½?said John Mackerey, an analyst at the credit ratings agency DBRS Morningstar."

The government, however, is in the process of winding down the TraceTogether system as the country moves to an endemic phase of the Covid pandemic. Other products include smart metering services, which allow remote monitoring of utilities and data on energy and water consumption. Customers for the smart-metering products include Singapore's major energy retailers, such as Pacific Light, large real estate companies with regional offices in Singapore, a Singapore university and a Singapore hospital, the prospectus said. The company also has an alarm alert system (AAS), which is a wireless emergency distress system developed to cater to the elderly, particularly those living alone or who are frail, the prospectus said; users in distress can press an emergency button and alerts will be sent to a hotline service, the prospectus said. In a tie-up with SIIX Singapore, iWOW has been awarded a tender to deploy the AAS system in various public housing (HDB) townships, the prospectus said. Around 16,000 alert buttons have been installed in homes of elderly individuals in HDB flats, the prospectus said. The prospectus cited another product, electronic monitoring systems (EMS), with iWOW receiving government contracts for monitoring ex-offenders and accused persons while they have been released or are on bail. The EMS is via a wireless ankle tag, as well as home-based wireless infrastructure, which provides alerts if bail or remission orders are being violated, the prospectus said.

764,1,"Argan, Inc. Reports Year-End and Fourth Quarter Results and Announces Increase to Share Repurchase Program",1113 words,ENP Newswire,"For the year, we were pleased to see increases in our business at all of our subsidiaries, resulting in an increase of 30% in our consolidated revenues year over year,' Rainer Bosselmann, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Argan, said. 'We are working hard to continue winning new projects to replace certain of our major projects expected to be completed this year. While it was difficult to see a few of our identified EPC project developments become unsuccessful, and for us to record certain impairments and writeoffs, we still believe there are a number of meaningful projects that will start this year for each of our subsidiaries. Since year end, our business in Ireland already has received two limited notices to proceed with early activities related to the construction of new gas-fired power plant facilities near Dublin. Also, we continue to be pleased with the current execution on all of our major projects despite the well-publicized global supply chain disruptions and current inflationary challenges. Delivering value to our customers and stockholders is our top priority. We are committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances returning capital to our stockholders and investing in our business and people. With this in mind, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the Company's existing share repurchase program, from $50 million to $75 million. We look forward to building on our Fiscal 2022 successes with a strong Fiscal 2023.' Fiscal Year 2022 Results Consolidated revenues for the year ended January 31, 2022 ('Fiscal 2022') were $509.4 million, which represented an increase of $117.2 million, or 29.9%, from consolidated revenues of $392.2 million reported for January 31, 2021 ('Fiscal 2021'). Revenues of the power industry services business increased by $78.7 million, or 24.7%, to $398.1 million for Fiscal 2022 compared to revenues of $319.4 million for Fiscal 2021. The revenues of this business represented 78.2% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2022 and 81.4% of consolidated revenues for the prior year. The primary drivers for the strong performance by the power industry services segment were increased revenues associated with the construction of the Guernsey Power Station and the Maple Hill Solar energy facility. The revenues of industrial fabrication and field services increased by $32.6 million, or 50.0%, to $97.9 million for Fiscal 2022. Revenues for this segment for Fiscal 2022 and 2021 represented approximately 19.2% and 16.6% of corresponding consolidated revenues, respectively. The improvement in the current year business of this segment, which occurred primarily in field services, reflected increased project activity for several customers due to, in part, reduced COVID-19 challenges. The amount of consolidated gross profit increased by 60.5% to $99.7 million for Fiscal 2022, or 19.6% of corresponding consolidated revenues, from the consolidated gross profit amount of $62.1 million reported for Fiscal 2021, which was 15.8% of corresponding consolidated revenues. The year-over-year improvement reflected the favorable impacts of the higher consolidated revenues and favorable gross profit contributions from all reportable business segments. Selling, general and administrative expenses for Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021 were $47.3 million, or 9.3% of corresponding consolidated revenues, and $39.0 million, or 10.0% of corresponding consolidated revenues, respectively. Additionally, as previously disclosed, due to the unsuccessful project development efforts by the Company's consolidated VIE, we recorded an impairment loss related to capitalized project development costs in the amount of $7.9 million during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022, of which $2.5 million was attributed to the non-controlling interest. Due primarily to the consolidated pre-tax book income reported for Fiscal 2022 in the amount of $47.1 million, we reported income tax expense in the amount of $11.4 million for the year. For Fiscal 2021, we reported consolidated pre-tax book income of $24.9 million and recorded income tax expense in the amount of $1.1 million, which amount is net of a $4.4 million net operating loss carryback benefit. For Fiscal 2022, our improved overall operating performance resulted in net income attributable to our stockholders in the amount of $38.2 million, or $2.40 per diluted share. For Fiscal 2021, we reported net income attributable to our stockholders in the amount of $23.9 million, or $1.51 per diluted share. As of January 31, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $440 million and net liquidity was $284 million; furthermore, the Company had no debt. The Company's consolidated amount of RUPO was approximately $0.4 billion as of January 31, 2022.

571,0,"3-BEDROOM HOUSE NEAR GRANDVIEW SIGHTS, RESTAURANTS PRICED AT $275,000",1019 words,Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,"""My whole family is in real estate,"" he said with a laugh. Now he's listed the house for $275,000 (MLS No. 1535036) with the same uncle, Steve Foltz of Century 21 Frontier Realty (www.century21.com[http://www.century21.com] or 724-809-6990). Foltz figures the two-story home was built on a half-acre lot somewhere around 1916. It's considered French Provincial, a style very popular in the 1920s. Aluminum siding covers the exterior, and the roofline has a fairly steep pitch. After buying the house, Foltz renovated the interior, adding a powder room on the first floor, updating the electrical system and replacing fixtures throughout the house. Then he did more. ""I had a contractor come in to redo the kitchen and [full] bathroom,"" he said. Tubular pipe shelving was installed, giving the home a more industrial look. Some has been removed, but the hallway unit with two shelves and lots of room for boots, shoes and umbrellas is staying. The living room has a decorative fireplace and newer laminate flooring that was also installed in the kitchen and old dining room. Foltz uses the dining room as a second living room. It has access to the kitchen and its own decorative brick fireplace. The new powder room with a live-edge counter on the vanity was tucked into one side of the room. The two-sided breakfast bar by the kitchen also has a live edge. It leads to an updated kitchen featuring a skylight and lots of storage, with dark cabinets on the bottom and white ones on top. Subway tile was used for the backsplash and brass for the cabinet hardware and faucet. Samsung appliances include a refrigerator, a dishwasher and a gas range. The upstairs full bathroom has new laminate flooring and a large vanity with a marble sink. The walk-in shower echoes the kitchen's subway tile with smaller mosaic tile on the floor. A frameless glass shower door and brushed nickel fixtures and fittings give the traditional bathroom a modern touch. The master bedroom, which was gutted soon after Foltz moved in, now has high ceilings, a bank of windows at one end, laminate flooring and two closets. The two other bedrooms are connected. A captive bedroom is a flaw in some houses, but Foltz turned it into a plus, making one bedroom a home office with a sleek desk. ""That desk is attached to the wall and staying,"" he said. ""That was a captive bedroom, so I turned that into a walk-in closet."" The new closet has shelving, clothes racks and more than enough room for a large wardrobe. With so many changes to the layout and use of rooms, Foltz has a suggestion for how the new owner could repurpose the original living room: ""You could turn that first room into a bedroom,"" he said, noting that it's close to the new powder room. Off the kitchen is the first of two decks that overlook the backyard, a lovely secluded area with grass that never needs to be mowed. ""Actually had natural grass turf put in,"" Foltz explained. ""I planted a peach tree, and there's raspberries, blueberries and blackberries. The kiwis haven't come in yet. They will in a few years."" The yard slopes away from the house and has good drainage, which means no flooding in the basement. There is a common path at the bottom of the fenced-in yard. Both decks are edged with solar-powered lights that Foltz installed. In the unfinished basement, the owner set up a workout room and is leaving behind a pull-up bar. The washer and dryer are also staying. The house has central air-conditioning, forced-air gas heating and a gas-fired water tank. The property's assessment is $102,000. Over the past three years, four houses have sold in the 100 block of Labelle Street for prices ranging from $107,000 in October 2019 to $485,000 in May 2021 (www2.alleghenycounty.us/realestate/GeneralInfo.aspx?). Foltz, who is moving to the North Hills to accommodate his growing family, said he will miss this house that is a few minutes' stroll to Grandview Avenue's view of Downtown and many bars and restaurants. He bought it when he was single, but that has definitely changed in the past seven years, he said as he juggled his 9-month-old daughter during a phone interview. ""I'm a chiropractor in East Liberty, so working from home, not at all,"" he said. ""Commutes to the city - five minutes has turned into 30 real quickly.""

278,0,"As Olympic torch is lit in hope, I see light at end of the tunnel",790 words,Evening Times,"When Ivy League universities in America are closing their doors and sending students home until August, donât rule out the first cancellation of an Olympic Games since World War II.? The IOC and host nation Japan are still confident that the Games will go ahead as planned, but no one has any real idea on how long this might go on for. Just from athletes I have spoken to, there is definitely real concern over the Games. The concern isnât just over whether the games get cancelled or not. For each individual athlete, it is also over their own preparations. As an athlete, getting sick is never great and if you got this virus bad you might face missing weeks of training. It could result on you missing the podium in Tokyo.? Or missing the Games altogether. Another friend of mine told me of his concerns that if they move the Games then he might not even get selected.? With markets crashing and supermarket shelves being cleared, these are definitely interesting times for everybody. But when you are living during this Covid-19 pandemic with a spinal-cord injury I guess it becomes even more daunting ï¿½?as such an injury can remove your cough and sneeze reflex. With very little core function, the thought of not being able to cough is a pretty scary proposition.? This might not sound too bad. But this virus hits elderly people hard ï¿½?and this also includes your biological age due to underlying medical conditions. So this is a scary time, and I completely feel for everyone in the same boat as me how scary this is.?I remember back to catching the flu in November last year ï¿½?I thought I was going to stop breathing. I couldnât cough to clear my lungs as the level of my injury is right at the nerves which go to the lungs.? It knocked me out for weeks, so I would be lying if I said I wasnât slightly scared of Covid-19 and its possible effects on my lungs.? I am a very optimistic person who always looks for solutions over problems. But I must admit this has got me a little bit shaken.? Watching whatâs happening in Italy has been hard to believe ï¿½?particularly as life seemed to be continuing almost as normal here.? I looked at the MRI of a 44-year-old manâs lungs and it was unbelievable, unfortunately he didnât survive.? So I am staying positive but also taking advice from Austrian neurologist Viktor Frankl.?He speaks of acceptance of your current situation. These are his own words ï¿½?which I have had on my wall for the last four years: âThe meaning of life lies in finding a purpose and taking responsibility for ourselves and other human beings.ï¿½? In other words, by having a clear âwhyï¿½?we can face all the âhowï¿½?questions of life. This has got me through all those hours in hospital and continues to serve me daily.? Thereâs a reason that in-flight safety presentations always instruct us to secure our own oxygen masks before assisting fellow passengers. We canât help others effectively unless we first protect ourselves. So I spoke with a medical oncologist friend and they advised me to self-isolate.? I am now on day four and thinking this could be a long road ahead; thankfully the weather is getting warmer and I got out on my bike for a few laps of Richmond Park. Along with indoor turbo sessions I am well prepared mentally for the process. I guess all my time in hospital equipped my mind to deal with self-isolating. It also probably helps being an introvert.? I canât help but think of the poor people undergoing their cancer treatment right now though, as I prepare for my own hospital appointment in a few weeks, but I am grateful that side of things is under control. My main goal is keeping my immune system strong because another issue I have from my spinal-cord injury is a compromised immune system, thus moving me into a vulnerable group.? Itâs hard to go from a strong athlete to now feeling so vulnerable, but thankfully I have a strong mind."
337,1,National Grid's coffers swell on the back of bill-payers' 'distress',475 words,The Times,"However, the utility company is facing scrutiny for taking increased profits when households are struggling to pay higher energy bills. Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP and member of the Treasury select committee, said: ""People can't pay their bills now, let alone what's going to happen later this year. These companies shouldn't be benefiting from the distress and anxiety of British consumers."" She said the announcement should put additional pressure on the government to consider a windfall tax on energy companies to help consumers after the energy price cap was increased this month by 54 per cent.  National Grid said that customers pay an average of Â£20 a year, about 3.3 per cent of their total bill, to the company as part of an electricity transmission charge. They pay a further Â£100 towards electricity distribution costs. A source close to the company said that the price controls set by Ofgem meant customers would be protected from significant price rises, while also enabling National Grid to invest billions of pounds a year in Britain's energy transition and supply security.  National Grid was privatised in 1990. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange five years later and has a market capitalisation of Â£43 billion. The company makes its money via charges on energy bills, regulated through price controls set by Ofgem, which also monitors its proposed investment plans.  National Grid owns almost 6,000 miles of electricity lines and cables and 5,000 miles of high-pressure gas pipes in the UK. Last month it struck a Â£4.2 billion deal to sell a controlling interest in its UK gas transmission and metering business to a consortium led by Macquarie, the Australian infrastructure investor. It also owns large networks in America. The company said that while it expects profits from its UK electricity businesses to be higher than anticipated, returns from its other divisions will be in line with forecasts. Overall earnings per share will be ""modestly higher"" than the guidance given on November 18, it said. The shares fell 1Â½p, or 0.1 per cent, to close at Â£11.84 yesterday."
770,0,Hackers Targeted News Corpâs Tech Suppliers,871 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"The company in a securities filing on Friday said it ârelies on third-party providers for certain technology and âcloud-basedï¿½?systems and services that support a variety of business operations,ï¿½?and that one of these systems âwas the target of persistent cyberattack activity.ï¿½?The attack came as U.S. officials over the past year have been increasingly warning of criminal and nation-state hackers breaking into the computer systems of organizations through sometimes opaque supply chains for software and other technologies. A News Corp spokesman on Friday declined to comment on its vendors or which data was stolen, citing a continuing investigation. In its email to staff, News Corp said that computer systems housing consumer and financial data werenât affected. âIn addition, we have not experienced related interruptions to our business operations,ï¿½?Chief Technology Officer David Kline and Chief Information Security Officer Billy OâBrien wrote in the email. âBased on our investigation to date, we believe the threat activity is contained.ï¿½?Messrs. Kline and OâBrien said their inquiry is in its early stages. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that hackers had access to News Corpâs systems since at least February 2020, gaining access to emails and Google Docs, including drafts of articles. Beijing that year expelled U.S. journalists employed by news outlets including the Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post. Gaining access to emails and documents could give hackers snapshots of reportersï¿½?sources and plans for articles, said Runa Sandvik, a former senior director for information security at the New York Times. âLetâs say attackers get access to emails. Then, potentially, there could be communications about who is going to cover the Olympics in China,ï¿½?said Ms. Sandvik, who now consults for media organizations. âHow are they collaborating?ï¿½?News Corp said Friday it disclosed the hack to law-enforcement officials and is providing technical details of the attack to the Media and Entertainment Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a nonprofit that shares security information among the media industry. Chris Taylor, director of the ME-ISAC, declined to comment on any data News Corp shared, as companies report such information under the promise of anonymity. In most incidents analyzed by the nonprofit, hackers blast out phishing emails to countless potential targets in the hope of landing a victim, Mr. Taylor said. Attacks tailored for specific organizations âare scarier but they are way less frequent,ï¿½?he said. âAttackers will do more research.ï¿½?Mandiant Inc., a cybersecurity company that specializes in investigating hacks, is helping News Corp respond to the incident. âMandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit Chinaâs interests,ï¿½?said David Wong, Mandiantâs vice president of consulting. âChina firmly opposes and combats cyber attacks and cyber theft in all forms,ï¿½?a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said in an email. âWe hope that there can be a professional, responsible and evidence-based approach to identifying cyber-related incidents, rather than making allegations based on speculations.ï¿½?The report of the breach comes days after Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray warned of Chinese-linked attempts to steal sensitive or valuable data. Speaking Tuesday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Mr. Wray highlighted last yearâs hack of thousands of U.S. companies through certain versions of Microsoft Corp.âs Exchange email client, which is used by many businesses. âThe Chinese government steals staggering volumes of information and causes deep, job-destroying damage across a range of industriesâso much so that, as you heard, weâre constantly opening new cases to counter their intelligence operations, about every 12 hours or so,ï¿½?he said. The Biden administration has ordered federal agencies to more aggressively vet their vendors and has urged companies to do the same as they shore up their internal defenses. Suppliers are appealing targets because they often have poorly understood connections to other businesses, cybersecurity experts say, raising the possibility that a single hack can wreak widespread havoc. In December 2020, several federal agencies discovered that a suspected Russian espionage operation broke into their computer systems through a compromised software update from network-management firm SolarWinds Corp. Criminal hackers breached software provider Kaseya Ltd. last summer, exposing hundreds of its clients to potential ransomware attacks. SolarWinds and Kaseya said they worked with U.S. officials and customers to respond to the respective breaches. Write to David Uberti at david.uberti@wsj.com Corrections & Amplifications News Corp said in a securities filing that third-party technology systems used by the company were targeted in a cyber attack. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said hackers entered the companyâs computer systems through third-party technology providers.

494,0,Delhi: 3 dry days a year as part of new liquor plan,276 words,Hindustan Times,"""In pursuance of the provisions of Rule 52 of Delhi Excise Rules, 2010, it is hereby ordered that -- Republic Day (January 26), Independence Day (August 15) and Gandhi Jayanti (October 2) - shall be observed as ""dry day"" in the national capital by all the licensees of the excise department and vends located in Delhi for the year 2022,"" the order said. At 21, the number of dry days in the Capital was among the highest across states and Union territories. A reduction in the number was a long-standing demand of liquor store owners, and bars and restaurants, and was expected to be part of the new excise policy that came into effect on October 1. Apart from the three, the Delhi government may declare any other dry day, from time-to-time, said the order. To be sure, the order added that restrictions on the sale of liquor on dry days will not apply for residents in hotels with a valid license.

591,0,"Crown, Blackstone confident state regulators will approve $8.9b deal",1094 words,The Age - Online,"""There are a few things that need to be done in terms of finalising our probity, but it's mostly done, and I'd have to say we haven't found anything that is going to be a bar to them proceeding,"" he said. Sources close to both Crown and Blackstone are also confident that regulators in Victoria, NSW and WA will also support the transaction and give Blackstone approval to take up Crown's casino licences. Blackstone is hoping to secure the approval to have the deal completed mid-year. The James Packer-controlled Crown has come under significant scrutiny in the past three years amid revelations of serious governance breaches including that some of its customers were engaged in criminal activity such as money laundering. Crown has faced inquiries in all three states where it operates. NSW stripped Crown of its prized licence for Barangaroo in late 2020 following the Bergin Inquiry. A Victorian royal commission into Crown's Melbourne casino led by retired judge Ray Finkelstein, QC, found Crown was unfit to run its flagship property but decided not to recommend cancelling its licence, and instead gave it two years to reform itself. Blackstone has also faced questions about its appropriateness amid concerns about the governance and oversight of its casino businesses in Latin America and Las Vegas. Blackstone - spearheaded by local dealmaker Chris Tynan - lobbed its fourth takeover offer for Crown Resorts this week, hiking the offer to $13.10 a share. Blackstone's newest offer has already gained the approval of the casino's board and the attention of billionaire majority shareholder Mr Packer, who said he was ""encouraged"" by the announcement. The offer is non-binding and subject to further due diligence and approvals from regulators. A binding offer from Blackstone is needed before regulators can make a final call. Former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett, who spearheaded Crown casino's opening in the 1990s after inheriting the project from the Kirner government, said he would ""like nothing more"" than for Crown to be in the hands of new owners with the experience and reputation for governance needed to run it. ""For more than 20 years it has been an icon of quality and our largest single-site employer,"" he told The Age and the Herald. ""I could think of nothing more important than for it to find security through an owner that can with experience provide consistently good governance."" A person close to Blackstone who could not speak publicly about the deal said the private equity firm had done all it could to win over regulators, and did not believe it would struggle to win the approval of the Foreign Investment Review Board which is required for the deal's completion. Crown's chairman, Ziggy Switkowski, would not be drawn on the deal's progression when contacted on Friday, other than to say things were ""working well"". ""We have a number in front of us, there's the due diligence process to be completed by Blackstone, everything's kind of working well between us,"" he said. Crown has been in the crosshairs of a number of buyers since Mr Packer first indicated in May 2019 he would be willing to sell down his stake. Fellow casino operator Star launched a merger proposal in May, which was rejected by the Crown board, and on Thursday said it remained interested in a transaction with Crown. However, the Sydney-based casino operator is facing its own governance scandal, with financial regulator AUSTRAC expanding its probe into alleged breaches of anti-money laundering laws. Mr Crawford said he believed ILGA's assessment of Crown would be finalised within the first quarter of 2022, in line with Blackstone's goal of having shareholders paid out by June. However, ILGA's probity review of Blackstone would not impact its separate assessment into Crown, he said, and whether the company should be able to continue gambling operations in NSW. ""The fact that Blackstone might swan in and become the owner doesn't in itself give them the right to conduct gaming,"" Mr Crawford said. ""The company [Crown] itself needs to prove that it's got adequate systems in place and run it properly and that staff are properly trained and know what they're doing to comply with their legal and governance obligations to make it work."" NSW Hospitality Minister Kevin Anderson said he held confidence in ILGA to complete all necessary checks and balances. ""The authority will be well placed to identify, investigate and prevent serious criminal issues such as those found in the Bergin Review,"" he said. ""In 2021 the government agreed to support all 19 recommendations contained in the Bergin report, including the creation of an independent casino regulator."" A spokeswoman for Victorian Gaming Minister Melissa Horne said since the final report of the Finkelstein inquiry, the government had prioritised what it considered the most urgent actions to restore public trust in the casino. ""The government is undertaking further detailed analysis and consultation on the remaining recommendations,"" she said.  Monash University gambling expert Charles Livingstone said the biggest regulatory hurdle faced by Blackstone would be demonstrating to the Foreign Investment Review Board that the takeover by a US private equity group was in the public interest. But Dr Livingstone said perhaps the biggest issue of all faced by the company would be lower profits as a result of the Finkelstein recommendations, which could cut Crown's revenue by as much as 30 per cent. ""I think the real issue for them is how they're going to make money,"" Dr Livingstone said. ""If the government chooses to implement the reforms of Finkelstein argued for around responsible gambling - that is limits on how long you can gamble for, carded play, amounts pre-set by punters to make sure they don't spend more than they can afford - I mean that would have a big impact."""
384,0,Can China's Starbucks win back investors?,2688 words,Financial Times,"I n less than five years of existence, Luckin Coffee has been variously a symbol of the dynamism of Chinese capitalism, the subject of a massive fraud scandal and now its new senior executives insist a plucky comeback story that has the potential to test US-China relations. Founded in 2017, the chain of coffee shops spread quickly across China, creating a homegrown challenger to Starbucks. Just two years later, Luckin floated on Nasdaq with a market value that reached $13bn as investors were seduced by the prospect of booming Chinese consumer demand. But the company unravelled in 2020 after it was revealed to have defrauded investors by faking more than $300mn of sales. Luckin was delisted by Nasdaq and forced to pay $180mn to settle charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The scandal stung investors such as BlackRock and GIC and provided the latest illustration of the failure of Big Four auditors to spot holes in company accounts Luckin had been audited by EY. Most of all, it became a trigger for a political controversy over the presence of Chinese companies on US capital markets. The scandal was seized upon by some US senators as a prime example of how Chinese corporates could not be trusted, part of a broader push by some in Washington to decouple the US financial system from China. But two years later, Luckin is hoping that investors, regulators and even politicians have forgotten the entire episode. The Chinese coffee chain is staging an audacious comeback that involves trying to raise new capital, meeting with investors and plotting with advisers to relist its shares in the US, according to people familiar with the matter. The company declined to comment on its proposed relisting plans, but one senior executive said it was now ""in a position where we're more comfortable re-engaging with public investors"" and that it wanted to ""regain credibility"". Luckin says it has turned a new page. ""Almost everything about Luckin apart from the name has changed over the past two years,"" says Guo Jinyi, who took over as chief executive officer in July 2020, two months after it was delisted. ""The business approach, the operation, the team, the company culture which was responsible for the financial problems have all changed."" Since the company was delisted, Luckin claims to have been on a tear in China. Revenues have more than doubled to $364.7mn year on year in the latest quarterly earnings report. Luckin now has more than 6,000 stores across China, about 500 more than Starbucks. The rapid growth story that global investors initially bought into when the company started trading in the US in 2019 appears to have been borne out. Chinese consumers have flocked to Luckin in search of cheap hits of caffeine. ""Luckin is truly a national enterprise. It goes abroad to rip off others' money and then gives coffee vouchers to people in China,"" says Wang Ning, a 29-year-old wealth manager in Beijing and regular Luckin customer. That growth is once again attracting the interest of investors. More than $20mn of its shares change hands in over-the-counter transactions every day and the company's market value has climbed back up to more than $3bn, after its shares lost 90 per cent of their value in 2020. The question is ""whether the fraud was hiding a permanently flawed business or if it was lying on top of something legitimate that had long-term viability"", says John Zolidis, president of the New York-based equity research firm Quo Vadis Capital. Zolidis says Luckin's shares are ""attractively valued given the overhang of fraud"". Luckin's attempt to relist is a big test of the efforts by some politicians in Washington to limit the presence of Chinese companies on US markets. Will the political, regulatory and legal obstacles that Chinese companies face frustrate Luckin's plans, or will they be overcome by the lure to investors of one of the world's most appealing consumer growth stories? ""Everyone expected it to sink but it instead appears to be a phoenix rising from the flames,"" says a veteran analyst of Chinese companies in Hong Kong. ""If it were to relist it would cause all sorts of political ramifications. To a degree, it would look like a political act as much as [having] accounting or investor-related repercussions."" Luckin Coffee was founded in the south-east coastal city of Xiamen by a serial entrepreneur, Charles Lu. The former chair of the coffee chain, whose name means ""lucky"" in Mandarin, expanded the company's network of stores in China at a breakneck speed. Lu brought on Qian Zhiya, a colleague from a car rental company that had experienced similarly explosive growth in its early years, to serve as Luckin's CEO. On the eve of Luckin's stock market debut in 2019, Forbes estimated that Lu's net worth was $2.3bn. 'Fundamentally broken' At the root of the Luckin fraud was its aggressive expansion strategies, favoured by Lu, of grabbing market share for new customers with heavily discounted beverages and then inflating the net selling price to hide the fact it was selling at a loss. ""The company was burning through money,"" says one Luckin insider of the period leading up to the IPO and follow-on offering. This was highlighted in a damning 89- page report first published by American short selling firm Muddy Waters in January 2020, which accused it of inflating sales, poor corporate governance and being a ""fundamentally broken"" business. An undercover research firm dispatched more than 1,000 researchers to Luckin Coffee stores to monitor customer traffic and coffee sales and found discrepancies with their reported figures. Lu and Qian, who have both since left the company, did not respond to requests for comment. Lu conceded on his public WeChat account in May 2020 that his ""style may have been too aggressive"" but added ""it was never my intention to deceive investors."" Two years on, Luckin says things have changed. A senior executive says its internal controls have been improved by hiring personnel from the Big Four accounting firms to conduct internal checks and report directly to the audit committee, which corporate governance experts say is a crucial step for any company that is planning to attract new international investors. At the centre of the coffee chain's turnround has been David Li, whose $2bn private equity fund, Centurium Capital, was one of Luckin's earliest and biggest financial backers. Centurium sold $232mn worth of shares just before the scandal but has since bought several larger stakes in Luckin at a much lower price. Last month, it became the company's controlling shareholder after it acquired shares that were previously held by Luckin's co-founders. Li has been ""cleaning up the company, getting rid of the bad guys"", says a person close to him. He ""had a team camped out at the company for months, working out a turnround strategy"". Luckin used the cash injection from Centurium to pay for shareholder litigation and repay some of the debts due on bonds and overseas restructuring costs. The company is now on the brink of ending bankruptcy proceedings in the US, a crucial step in its path to relist. As a result of the bankruptcy process, the hedge funds that bought about $420mn of its convertible bonds in January 2020 will receive about 96 cents on the dollar. ""After only one-and-a-half years, they have got almost all their money back, plus some new bonds, cash and stock,"" says an external adviser involved in the restructuring process. ""If you break it down, it is a genuinely unprecedented situation,"" says the person. ""I've never seen another case where you have such a high return for creditors, settlement of legal and regulatory matters and improving operating performance all in the same short period of 18 months."" Li and Guo's turnround strategy includes closing down underperforming stores and increasing the price of a cup of coffee by 60 per cent to an average of $2.50 still half the price of an equivalent Starbucks coffee. Luckin claims it has reduced property and staffing costs through the use of an ""in-app"" purchase system and has started using franchisees to expand the number of its stores rather than owning them all outright. It has also had success with new beverages, including a coconut velvet latte that sold out over the summer. Xu Xueqiong, 36, owner of a small business in Anqing, a city in Anhui province, is an avid fan of the drink. She says Luckin's branding, use of coupons and sweeter flavours ""suit Chinese people's consumption habits"". Michael Norris, a senior research analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina, says that Guo's gamble to start using franchisee partners to share the risk of opening new stores, especially in lower-tier cities, has paid off. Revenue from those stores has tripled in the last quarter compared with the same period the previous year. But analysts have warned that Chinese consumer habits are fickle, and Luckin is increasingly fighting competition from domestic rivals with substantial financial backing, including a new, trendier competitor, Manner Coffee. Norris adds that investors may be sceptical at reports of accelerating growth: ""Revenues rising sharply is something that those of us who have been following Luckin have seen before."" It reported a net loss of $859mn for the 2020 financial year. In the first nine months of 2021, Luckin's net losses were $3.6mn, according to its financial statements. Carson Block, founder and head of Muddy Waters, says he is ""surprised"" at Luckin's turnround: ""In the old days, companies were finished once confirmed that they were frauds ... But Luckin seems to be saying the fraud is water under the bridge. That now they've raised the money on the back of lies, they're putting it to use and becoming real,"" adds Block. Winning back trust Far harder than inventing coconut lattes will be the job of convincing foreign investors and regulators that its finances can be trusted. Luckin is setting out plans to relist at a time when tensions between the US and China over the quality of Chinese companies listed in US markets is at an all-time low. The most recent case was the disastrous listing of Didi, a ride-hail- ing app, last June, when regulatory blocks by Beijing days after its flotation meant its shares crashed by 80 per cent and investors lost billions. Since then, new flotations by Chinese companies in the US have been in effect paralysed. Both Washington and Beijing are wary of continuing to permit the deepening of financial links between Wall Street and corporate China. To relist on the Nasdaq centralised exchange Luckin needs to first formally exit bankruptcy proceedings, which according to an individual involved in the process should happen in the next few weeks. Luckin will then apply to rejoin Nasdaq's centralised exchange. The exchange can deny a company's listing if it believes investors might be at risk, but in general, it is required to accept those companies that meet the exchange's requirements. The SEC and Nasdaq refused to comment on Luckin's relisting plans. The company will also need to navigate new laws that have come into place in the wake of its 2020 scandal which make the US a far less hospitable environment for Chinese companies going public. The US Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which was passed in late 2020, puts pressure on Chinese companies to make audit papers available for inspection. It could force about 240 Chinese companies worth a combined $2tn to delist from US exchanges over the next few years. ""There is no indication that either the US or China will budge on this issue,"" says Jay Ritter, an IPO expert at the University of Florida. Under this law, the US authorities could delist companies that fail to submit to US regulatory checks on their audits for three years in a row. This has resulted in a stalemate for companies and their accountants as Beijing does not permit foreign oversight of Chinese companies' financial records. As a result, even if it successfully relists, Luckin could be delisted again by US regulators in the future purely because of a lack of access to its audit files. ""If Luckin relists and is trading, what's the price discount for the fact that if you buy the shares you don't know if or where you're going to be able to sell them in two or three years' time?"" says one accounting expert. Crucial to Luckin's comeback will be investors' confidence that its books are credible, especially given the failures of original auditors EY to identify duplicity, and perhaps also the fact that the CFO at the time of the scandal, Reinout Schakel, is still in place. Since the fraud was exposed, Luckin has had two new audit firms. The group appointed Hong Kong accounting firm Centurion ZD CPA as its auditor in April 2021 after its predecessor, New York-based Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk, was replaced. As US regulators and exchanges put greater focus on the quality of Chinese company audits, the work of a smaller firm is likely to receive more scrutiny. Centurion, which says it has about 40 accountants in Hong Kong and the US, is registered with the US audit regulator, allowing it to sign off the accounts of Chinese companies listed in America. But so far it audits just a small number of such companies traded on Nasdaq or over the counter. Centurion did not respond to a request for comment. In its audit of Luckin's 2020 accounts, the most recent full-year audited financial statements, Centurion identified as a ""material weakness"" that Luckin lacked ""entity level control policies and procedures, including failure to demonstrate commitment to integrity and ethical values"". It also said Luckin lacked appropriate separation of duties, including around making investment decisions and use of funds. Even so, some investors may be tempted back into its equity because of Luckin's growth prospects. ""By market capitalisation per store, it is a cheap and attractive asset,"" says a fund manager who has traded Luckin's over-the-counter shares. Yet so far, it is primarily China-focused hedge funds and mainland capital that have flooded back into Luckin shares. ""It's hard to see someone like Fidelity getting back into it on day one,"" the fund manager adds. Winning back the support of large international investors would be critical for Luckin's comeback story. ""I suspect there is work to be done for redemption before that,"" says Kerrie Waring, chief executive of the International Corporate Governance Network, a lobby group for institutional investors. As investors question whether they can trust Luckin, one former US regulator says the fact that the company is under such intense scrutiny means it may be less likely to repeat past crimes. ""Sometimes thesafest place to eat is a place that's just reopened after the health department shut them down.""

939,0,Genting Hong Kong faces demand on US$2.78 billion of debt as the bankruptcy of its MV Werften shipyard in Germany triggers cross default,626 words,scmp.com,"Genting Hong Kong faces an immediate debt payment of US$2.78 billion after the unit filed for bankruptcy this week, as a bailout by the German government fell through.  Genting Hong Kongâs MV Werften shipyard filed for insolvency on Monday as it ran out of cash during the construction of the Global Dream, a cruise ship with the capacity for 5,000 people. A ï¿½?00 million (US$678 million) bailout plan that required Genting Hong Kong to put up 10 per cent of the capital fell through. The cross-default triggered would cause a material adverse effect on its business operations, prospects, and financial condition, Genting said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange, where its shares are traded. The board, headed by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay, is discussing with bankers and professional advisers âto evaluate options available to the company,ï¿½?Genting added. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge[https://www.scmp.com/knowledge], our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Trading in Genting was suspended from Friday for the announcement when it fell 6.4 per cent to 73 Hong Kong cents. The stock has lost half its value since 2018, with US$766 million of capitalisation wiped out, as the global cruise and tourism industry became the biggest casualty of the Covid-19 pandemic. âCruise lines, related to the tourism businesses, were hard hit by the coronavirus outbreak and many of them cannot survive without financial support from the authorities or their shareholder,ï¿½?said Lu Ming, an agent at Shanghai Ocean Shipping Agency. âIt is not a surprise to see a builder of cruise ships become insolvent.ï¿½?Global Dream was originally expected to set sail in 2021 but construction stalled at 80 per cent completion due to the onset of the pandemic, MV Werften said. The insolvency filing in Germany will trigger cross-default events under certain financing arrangements of the Genting group, involving an aggregate principal amount of US$2.78 billion, the company said in its exchange filing. That leaves it at the mercy of creditors, who now have the right to demand or sue for immediate repayment. Besides the MV Werften shipyard, Genting Hong Kong operates three cruise lines ï¿½?Dream Cruises, Crystal Cruises and Star Cruises. It also owns and operates the Resorts World Manila casino and resort in the Philippines.  Genting Hong Kong reported a US$283.3 million loss in the first half of 2021, in addition to a US$1.72 billion setback in 2020 the global travel and tourism industry came to an abrupt halt because of Covid-19 restrictions. The bankruptcy filing in Germany stemmed from a legal proceeding under which German creditors including the Economic Stabilisation Fund required the shipyard to meet certain milestones before drawing down a US$88 million loan to ease its liquidity crunch. Authorities in Germany blamed Genting and senior executives for the shipyardâs collapse, according to a report by the Associated Press. Genting Hong Kong said that it had offered to increase its funding from US$30 million to US$42 million, but was still unable to access new funds to bail out the shipbuilding subsidiary."
831,0,Harry and Meghan wade into Spotify anti-vax dispute; Sussexes warn of 'serious harms' of disinformation,898 words,National Post,"Prince Harry and Meghan have been ""expressing concerns"" to Spotify behind the scenes, it has emerged, with the couple warning of the ""serious harms"" of false information. The revelation comes as the dispute continues over the platform's marquee podcast - The Joe Rogan Experience - which has faced criticism due to the host's alleged airing of vaccine-skeptical views and debunked claims regarding the treatment of COVID-19. Harry and Meghan have waded into the dispute, with an Archewell spokesman stating: ""Since the inception of Archewell, we have worked to address the real-time global misinformation crisis. ""Hundreds of millions of people are affected by the serious harms of rampant misand disinformation every day. ""Last April, our co-founders began expressing concerns to our partners at Spotify about the all-too-real consequences of COVID-19 misinformation on its platform. ""We have continued to express our concerns to Spotify to ensure changes to its platform are made to help address this public health crisis. ""We look to Spotify to meet this moment and are committed to continuing our work together as it does."" The comments from Archewell come after musicians Neil Young and Joni Mitchell demanded their music be pulled from the platform unless Joe Rogan's podcast was removed. Rock musician Nils Lofgren, best known as a member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band as well as Crazy Horse, on Saturday became the latest artist to join a protest kicked off by his bandmate Young, saying in a statement that he, too, would ""cut ties with Spotify"" and urged ""all musicians, artists and music lovers everywhere"" to do the same. Separately, BrenÃ© Brown, a research professor at the University of Houston who hosts the popular podcasts ""Unlocking Us"" and ""Dare to Lead"" on Spotify, tweeted Saturday that she ""will not be releasing any podcasts until further notice"" but did not list a specific reason or whether the announcement was linked to the broader protest. Spotify removed Young's music from the platform and retained The Joe Rogan Experience, which signed an exclusive deal with Spotify worth over US$100 million in 2020, and is now one of the world's most-listened-to podcasts. And competitors appear to be seeking an advantage amid the controversy: Apple Music on Friday called itself the ""the home of Neil Young"" in a tweet promoting his catalogue. Lofgren and Mitchell in their statements said they stood in solidarity with Young, who collaborated with Crazy Horse to produce many well-known albums. Young had demanded that his music be taken off the streaming platform in response to the presence of ""fake information about vaccines"" in some of the content it hosts. The letter, which was posted to his website and has since been removed, cited Rogan as part of Young's issue with Spotify. ""They can have Rogan or Young,"" the legendary musician reportedly wrote. ""Not both."" Spotify soon began removing Young's music from its catalogue, including his bestknown hits such as Heart of Gold, Harvest Moon and Rockin'in the Free World. Mitchell, whose renowned album Blue just turned 50, wrote in a statement on her website on Friday that she ""decided to remove all of"" her music from Spotify because ""irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives."" Spotify, in a statement previously provided to The Washington Post, acknowledged the balancing act. ""We want all the world's music and audio content to be available to Spotify users. With that comes great responsibility in balancing both safety for listeners and freedom for creators,"" a Spotify spokesperson said. ""We have detailed content policies in place and we've removed over 20,000 podcast episodes related to COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic,"" the statement continued. ""We regret Neil's decision to remove his music from Spotify, but hope to welcome him back soon."" Rogan's podcast has faced criticism during the COVID-19 pandemic for allegedly providing a platform for fringe views, including an episode with vaccine scientist Dr. Robert Malone, who made claims about the dangers of the COVID-19 vaccine.

541,1,"Nigeriaâs Kudi, Africaâs Financial Technology Company, Changes Name to Nomba",1088 words,Ventures Africa,"This solution could not have come at a more opportune time. From neighborhood kiosks to high-brow restaurants and fashion stores, the small business segment in Nigeria is responsible for 86 percent of the total workforce through 41 million micro-businesses and 73,000 small and medium enterprises as indicated by the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) National Survey. Yet, payments in the retail sector in Nigeria are largely offline with over 25 million merchants yet to accept any form of digital payments. Many of the retail businesses who do accept digital payments lack a unified platform to seamlessly manage their businesses across multiple touch-points and locations. From payment collection, to trade financing, to intelligent business reporting, and even multiple location management, businesses largely depend on traditional financial services providers who do not provide the ecosystem of services that support their businesses. Having all of this on one platform will really make a difference and make business easier. With Nomba, underserved and full-fledged businesses can self-onboard in five minutes and order a full-service integrated terminal and dashboard designed to manage all their payment needs whether in cash, cards, transfers, USSD or QR across multiple channels and locations. Over the next six months, Nomba will extend the penetration of its POS terminals across the country, giving more businesses access to technology that delivers real-time oversight of all business transactions whether they are a one-man business or a corporate, all on one dashboard. It also plans to expand its product offerings into invoicing, payroll management and other tools that boost the productivity of businesses. To drive this expansion, the fintech has appointed two key new executives Jeffrey Williams as Vice President, Business, and Toluwani Ijogun as Vice President Brand, Marketing and Communications. Harnessing their experience and expertise, Nomba, will accelerate its expansion across the country ensuring that over 350,000 businesses are equipped with all the tools required to run their businesses seamlessly, by the end of the year. As VP, Brand Marketing and Communications, Toluwani Ijogun will be responsible for brand strategy, including all consumer, business-to-business and partner marketing activities that advance the companyâs goals. She will also oversee all internal and external communications, insights and marketing capabilities and analytics for the brand. Toluwani brings with her over 15 years experience managing premium brands such as Guaranty Trust Bank; GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Plc; Philips across West Africa; Eat Nï¿½?Go (owners of Dominoâs Pizza and Coldstone Creamery franchise in Nigeria); FSDH Group and most recently as Senior Vice President: Brand and Marketing for Kuda Bank where she played a pivotal role in the companyâs growth in the Nigerian market. Jeffrey Williams-Edem brings over 18 years of experience in sales, business development strategy, digital payment and merchant acquisition spanning multiple industries. He joins Nomba as VP, Business from Interswitch where he played an integral role in the design and deployment of their first retail solution strategy for the micro, small and medium enterprise market in Nigeria. As Kudi transitions to Nomba, Jeffrey will be responsible for creating and driving the machinery to deliver on business acquisition, new market development and revenue. He will also oversee the sales, business operations and the development of new products. âSince our launch in 2017, our technology and insights have enabled merchants to earn and build successful businesses, transforming their own lives and that of others. Today, complimentary regulatory frameworks and well-thought-out partnerships with financial institutions have synergized to create an enabling environment for fintechs to chart the future of payments, making access to digital payment solutions ubiquitous. Over the next five years, we will be leveraging these factors, as well as the experience and expertise Jeff and Tolu bring to deepen the penetration of digital payment solutions across the country, making payments easier for everyone,ï¿½?said Yinka Adewale, Chief Executive Officer, Nomba. Nomba started its journey in 2017 as a chatbot designed to simplify payments. However, in 2018 it evolved into a company whose distinct point of sale (POS) technology, partnerships with banks and other licensed financial institutions democratized access to banking products and services for merchants across Nigeria. This also includes core banking solutions such as opening savings accounts and loans. Listed as a YCombinator Top Company in 2022, there are today over 150,000 businesses on the Nomba platform enabled to carry out card, cash and bank transfer related transactions for their own businesses and on behalf of their customers. With an onboarding rate of over 10,000 new businesses monthly, Nomba currently processes over $16m in payments daily across more than 500,000 unique transactions.

This journey started in 2016 with simplifying access to financial services using âKudi.aiï¿½?a chatbot integration that responds to financial requests on social apps. It then morphed into powering a community of independent businesses who act as neighborhood banks offering basic financial services such as cash withdrawal, transfer and bill payments to all Nigerians, especially those in underserved communities.

Hillier took issue with Alghabra's position that such mandates would help fix supply chains snarled by the pandemic, something the Lanark-Frontenac-Kingston MPP said on Monday was condemning ""Canadians to starvation in the name of being safe."" In a Twitter post of his own, Mendicino fired back at Hillier, calling the remarks ""flagrantly abusive, offensive and Islamophobic."" The minister also tagged the social media giant's Twitter handle, imploring the company to act. Hillier has since taken to Twitter to accuse Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his cabinet and the country's premiers of committing acts of terrorism for upholding pandemic-induced restrictions. But a day after the MPP's tweet was first posted and reported by users, Twitter ruled that the message had not broken any of its safety policies, one of which includes content that harasses or threatens people because of their identity. ""It would be bad enough if it was just a breach of Twitter's own rules, which are there to create safety for all of its users. But it doesn't end there,"" Mendicino said. ""By leaving up this tweet, and many others, that allows for the proliferation of hate speech to remain published on that platform. And that is an extremely concerning issue for all of us."" Alghabra told reporters on Wednesday that he was ""not unfamiliar"" with attacks targeting his background, stating that he expects all Canadians to ""avoid promoting fear and hate online or in person."" This week's incident marks the second time in as many months that Mendicino, who left the immigration file in October to take on public safety, has appealed to Twitter to remove harmful content. In late December, the minister penned a letter to Twitter Canada's managing director, urging the company to reconsider its decision to allow a threatening post targeting Canadian Medical Association president Dr. Katharine Smart to remain on its site. The account behind the post was ultimately deactivated, though it's unclear whether that outcome was related to Mendicino's intervention. The Liberal government is working on introducing legislation to tackle harmful online content, including hate speech, that would see social media platforms held to account for content posted on their sites. Ottawa's attempts to develop such legislation last year came up against concerns that the planned bill would hamper freedom of expression and privacy rights, among other criticisms. The legislation is being tweaked to include feedback generated from a consultation period held during the last federal election, the results of which have not been publicly released. While that task primarily falls to Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez, Mendicino says it's an issue with which he plans to remain engaged. ""I'll continue to work with various communities, who...have been disproportionately targeted online and ensure that the resources are there to support them, and to be outspoken about it,"" he said. ""In a perfect world, we'll see some of these tweets come down a lot faster,"" Mendicino added."
282,0,"Of the ""Ten Best Restaurants in Peterborough"", three were closed and the rest weren't in Peterborough'",1557 words,The Times,"Ahead of a trip to Peterborough with my son a couple of weeks ago to watch QPR smash Peterborough United 10-0 in the FA Cup and progress to the fifth round for a glamorous televised showdown with Manchester City, I asked in my Notebook column for some lunch recommendations in the town. I had never reviewed a restaurant in Peterborough, and nor had anyone else, ever, in the history of national newspapers, so it seemed to present too good an opportunity to miss. I don't know much about Peterborough, apart from that Roy Kinnear dressed up as a Roman centurion there in a series of adverts in the 1980s that hailed what they called ""the Peterborough Effect"" and sought, one assumes, to encourage investment in the ""New Town"" (as it was designated in 1967, despite already being a cathedral city) and turn it back into the bustling metropolis it had been 2,000 years before. From the look of the restaurant scene, alas, it doesn't seem to have worked. Of the ""Ten Best Restaurants in Peterborough"" that I found online, three were permanently closed and the other seven were not in Peterborough. Obviously, there would be nice little pubs out in the countryside, there always are. But I needed to be close to the stadium so I could drive up, park, and then eat in a defined time slot that would allow me to get to the ground and through the turnstile in time to catch every single one of the 15 or more goals we would smash past the hapless ""Posh"". So I put it out to tender. You replied in your hundreds below the line. Mostly with the names of places that were either permanently closed or not in Peterborough. The Oundle Tap and Kitchen in nearby Oundle, for example, generated the most recommendations and sounds excellent but is not, alas, in Peterborough. It is in nearby Oundle. Should we draw Oundle in the cup next year - pray God - I swear on my life I will go. Phil Harrison at least got the geographical gist when he suggested, ""The Palmerston Arms on Oundle Road, near the ground, for cobs and real ale,"" and I'm sure it's lovely, but even I can't squeeze 1,500 words out of a pint and a white bread sarnie (well, I can, and have, but I was aiming higher this time). He also mentioned the Woodston Chippy on the walk to the ground (depending on where you are walking from, of course) and the pies at the ground itself (warning, like others who praised them, of their ""100C heat"" and attendant burns risk). But, again, chippies and pies are much of a muchness, and anyway nothing can touch the double cheeseburger at QPR from the stall on the corner between Loftus Road and Bloemfontein, which Sam, or any other Superhoop, will tell you is the best in England. Barry Shooter suggested a detour to the George at Stamford, but I've been there and reviewed it before, and it's not, as its Stamford location attests, in Peterborough. And Simon Chapman told me the pizzas were fabulous at the Green Dragon in Ryhall but that is, annoyingly, in Ryhall, which is practically Nottingham. ""York Viking"" was even more defeatist (strangely, for a ferocious Norseman), with his suggestion that, ""If you're travelling by train out of King's Cross, go to Nenno on Caledonian Road. Wood-fired pizza oven."" Others, such as Martin Royd (""Try the Stibbington Diner - while it's not posh London nosh, it might do you good to see how others live"") and Michael Patterson (""Try the Great Northern Hotel opposite Peterborough station: perfectly edible but probably not up to the standards you're used to"") seemed to be suggesting places designed either to reinforce any negative suspicions I might have fostered about the Petroborovian restaurant scene, or to punish me for having high expectations, which was weird. Noel McLaughlin, Stephen Burnett and others gave a big shout-out for the Haycock in Wansford, which was another fair detour from the town, and while Knowit2's tip that ""Catherine of Aragon is interred at Peterborough Abbey"" was very helpful, I fear that the old Spanish bird would have made for a somewhat chewy lunch. Likewise, GiantHaystacks' tip that, ""If you get a flat tyre in the car park I can recommend the local Kwik Fit."" Other suggestions included the Gurkha Durbaar (but Sam won't eat a curry for lunch), the Cherry House at Werrington and the Falcon at Fotheringhay (detours, detours) and when I pleaded, pleaded, for somewhere IN PETERBOROUGH, I was repeatedly offered C?te in the cathedral precinct and that other great example of temple catering, the Caroline Hand Executive Suite at Peterborough FC, where Â£54, I was reliably informed, would buy me my lunch, match ticket (""in padded seating""), half-time tea and cakes and programme. Except Sam and I already had our tickets, in the away end, right in the front row in the hope of scoring a shirt thrown by Charlie Austin, Chris Willock or, pray God, ""Uncle"" Albert Adomah himself. For we are the pride of west London, the blue and the white, we hate Cardiff City and Chelsea are shite, and we just wanted a nice little pre-match scoff (with my old pal Toby and his three sons) that I could feasibly put on expenses. So when a Mr Kim Swithinbank (among others) suggested the Bell Inn at Stilton and said it was ""en route"" from London, I was in. I already love two Bells (the ones at Langford and Sapperton, both in Gloucestershire) and as for its being in Stilton, well, at least there would be cheese. And I cannot fault the location, at least from the point of view of matchday convenience. Because from the looming of the Bell on my sat-nav as we roared up the A1(M), it was clear that it was situated almost literally on the motorway - possibly too close, one might say, for anything other than a London football fan's pre-Peterborough pitstop. We came off at the junction, switched back 180 degrees and dawdled along a road adjacent to the big one, through newish housing, until the road widened and widened (and widened) to run through a sweet, empty, old village with no parking restrictions at all. Literally, none. I've not seen the like since the late 1970s. We pulled up (for free and without having to reverse) outside a pretty 18th-century coaching inn (correction, 15th-century coaching inn, just checked, bloody hell) with a giant sign featuring a bell and the word ""Stilton"", which swung back and forth in the wind with a loud ""hee-haw, hee-haw"" that rang ominously round the otherwise silent street and reminded me of the opening scenes of Once Upon a Time in the West. Inside, though, there was warmth and bustle. I was glad I'd asked for a table in the bar rather than the theoretically smarter ""restaurant"" (always best for vibes), our hostess was delightful, and the light, fragrant Fool's Nook (Â£3.55) was an excellent driving beer (one pint only, with food, leave me alone - I take the 15th-century approach when away from home, that the beer is safer than the water). As for that food, if you stick to the delicious halloumi fries (not cheap at Â£6 for 4 wee batons) you'll do very well. Straying into more exotic territory, however, one encounters the ""Honey and mustard glazed sausages"", which is a misleading plural because what your Â£6 in fact gets you is one ordinary breakfast banger cut into four chunks in a bowl with cocktail sticks. Then there's the cod cheek scampi (Â£9) and a fried duck breast (Â£20) that looked okay and a Â£16 burger that was somewhat misshapen and carbonised but Sam managed to swallow some of, and a plate of those rectangular ""Fish & chips"" (Â£17) that you do see in pubs sometimes, and then the ""Stilton fries"" (Â£6), which was a nice idea that I think could work well with lovely crispy fries, cut from real potatoes, deep-fried to order and served hot. But, look, the main thing is that, thanks to the Bell's confident pricing, I was able to put more than Â£200 into the local economy, and get to the game in good time to see us thrashed 2-0 and dumped unceremoniously out of the cup. Which was not at all, as I said at the top of this piece, what I had come to Peterborough to watch us do. On the plus side, though, as the Rangers faithful sang, ""We lost 2-0, who gives a f***? We're QPR, we're going up!"" And, possibly from the gastronomic hardcore, the always uplifting, ""We get to go home, you have to stay here?""

532,1,Worldwide Semiconductor Revenue Grew 26% in 2021: Report,440 words,Dataquest,"Samsung Electronics regained the top spot from Intel for the first time since 2018, though by less than a percentage point, with revenue increasing 28% in 2021 (see Table 1). Intelâs revenue declined 0.3%, garnering 12.2% market share compared to 12.3% market share for Samsung. Within the top 10, AMD and Mediatek experienced the strongest growth in 2021 at 68.6% and 60.2% growth, respectively. The most significant shift among the semiconductor vendor ranking in 2021 was HiSilicon dropping out of the top 25. âHiSiliconâs revenue declined 81%, from $8.2 billion in 2020 to $1.5 billion in 2021,ï¿½?said Norwood. âThis was a direct result of the U.S. sanctions against the company and its parent company Huawei. âThis also impacted Chinaâs share of the semiconductor market as it declined from 6.7% market share in 2020 to 6.5% in 2021.

741,0,CNN's Brian Stelter blindsided by co-author of Fox News study,854 words,Washington Post.com,"The study's participants were impressed: ""They said, 'Oh, wow, I had no idea. I didn't know all this because Fox News wasn't telling me,'"" said Broockman on Sunday's ""Reliable Sources."" ""You call this partisan coverage filtering,"" Stelter told Kalla. ""And basically, you're proving what we've sensed for a while, which is that Fox viewers are in the dark about bad news for the GOP."" Kalla confirmed the Fox News coverage model but put a stop to the victory lap: ""On the flip side, CNN engages in this partisan coverage filtering as well as that we find. For example, during this time, the Abraham Accords were signed, and these were the agreements where Israel, the UAE and Bahrain signed a major peace agreement. And we see that Fox News covered this really major accomplishment about 15 times more than CNN did. So we established both networks are really engaging in this partisan coverage filtering. It's not about one side, it's about the media writ large."" Stelter objected that this was a venture in bothsidesism. But the report has data on the discrepancy. On Sept. 15, 2020, President Donald Trump presided over the signing of normalization agreements between Israel and Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. ""After decades of division and conflict, we mark the dawn of a new Middle East,"" Trump said at the ceremony. On Fox News shows airing from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m., the news racked up 1,278 words of coverage, according to the report, while the coverage on the equivalent CNN shows clocked in at just 84 words. The study's focus on prime-time shows is logical, considering that's where the big viewer numbers stack up ï¿½?and also, not coincidentally, where opinion programming molds viewpoints. Yet, it does bear mentioning that according to a Nexis search, CNN did produce significant coverage of the Abraham Accords at other times and on other platforms. In a chat with the Erik Wemple Blog, Kalla cited another news category from the study's time period (Aug. 31 to Sept. 25, 2020): ""Democratic elites violating COVID restrictions,"" coverage primarily focused on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's rule-breaking visit to a San Francisco salon. Fox News's shows covered the topic with 2,464 words, while CNN's tallied 209 words. ""What we're showing is that CNN does engage partisan coverage filtering. They should be aware of that and can do better as a network,"" Kalla told the Erik Wemple Blog. As for the Fox News viewers, though, the study found a somewhat malleable mind-set among participants: ""We find both large decreases in knowledge of information covered on Fox News during the incentivized period and large increases in knowledge of information CNN covered during this period, indicating that both substitution away from Fox News and substitution towards CNN occurred and impacted viewers' beliefs,"" notes the study, which is now undergoing peer review. The study's even more fundamental threshold finding, however, is that Fox News viewers will sample CNN for what amounts to minimum wage in many jurisdictions. Who would have thought? To use the benchmarks in the Broockman-Kalla study, it would take just $1.26 billion plus untold administrative costs to peel away a prime-time Fox News audience of 3 million viewers for a month or so. That's called a bargain. The more realistic upshot is that Democratic politicians should consider seeking face time on Fox News. That approach has become policy within the Biden White House, which is eyeing the network's audience of Republicans, independents and Democrats. Kalla notes that after the incentives ran out, viewers in the treatment group went back to Fox News in ""overwhelming"" numbers. ""Fox News viewers do live in a bubble where they're not exposed to liberal accomplishments, Democratic accomplishments,"" says Kalla, arguing that politicians ""need to meet viewers where they are."" In his analysis of the study, President Barack Obama said that people ""underestimate the degree of pliability in our opinions and our views."" That's one way to frame the study's conclusions. Another comes from one of the study's respondents, who said, ""You have to watch some of all the lying a-- media to get anything resembling the whole story."""
470,0,Paediatricians warn closing schools must be last resort,549 words,The New Zealand Herald,"Education Minister Chris Hipkins has made it clear he wants schools to stay open this year if at all possible. But the paediatricians warn if the Government doesnât communicate to all parents that school is low-risk, many will still keep their children at home ï¿½?with long-term harms to kids who are already at a disadvantage. The report was written by 10 of New Zealandâs foremost paediatric experts including Starship developmental paediatrician Dr Jin Russell and experts in MÄori and Pasifika health including Dr Rawiri McKree Jansen. It said many of the pandemicâs indirect harms have come amid school closures and lockdowns, including poorer mental health, loss of learning and relationships, poverty, overcrowding, and worryingly high rates of family violence and abuse. Those harms could have life-long impacts, and they werenât evenly spread ï¿½?MÄori and Pasifika children and those who already suffer disadvantage would be hit hardest, the report said. Schools were not a high-transmission risk compared with places like restaurants, churches or workplaces, and they were an essential service for children, it said. So they should not be closed while other, higher-risk places stayed open. But whole school closures could be hard to avoid during a localised lockdown, or if large numbers of teachers were sick or isolating. When this happened the focus would need to be on equity. âStudents from disadvantaged homes may not have access to the devices needed to participate in online learning, and these same students are also at higher risk of infection or isolation, due to inequitable community spread.ï¿½?The group also called for fresh thinking about how to keep children engaged with learning and seeing friends if schools closed. They suggested schools could still host in-person outdoor sessions such as physical education, small-group learning sessions, or games for primary school children in case of an outbreak closing classrooms. Lead author Russell said the group had seen the indirect harms of lockdowns first hand, from children who ended up in hospital because of abuse, or were suffering from overcrowding and food insecurity. School acted as a buffer for the most vulnerable children, with a safe environment and adults they could trust, she said. The group doesnât downplay the direct harms that come from falling ill with the virus. But Russell said overall, children were at lower risk than adults. âWeâre looking at a less severe [Omicron] variant, on top of lower background risk for children, and now with vaccinations to directly protect children,ï¿½?she said. âThe most important thing that families can do to get ready for school this year is to get their childâs first dose of the Pfizer vaccination, and for parents to be boosted.ï¿½?A first dose provided excellent protection for children against ending up in hospital, she said. A second dose locked in long-term immunity."
732,0,"Russian TV news: Invasion one month on, Biden's son linked to Ukraine biolabs",1068 words,BBC Monitoring Former Soviet Union,"Ukraine reports Dispatches from the conflict zone painted the customary picture of Russian advances and Ukrainian atrocities. State-owned Rossiya 1 had a correspondent with mechanised infantry operating in the Hostomel and Bucha area outside Kyiv. He dismissed as ""Ukrainian propaganda"" information that they are in retreat or in danger of being encircled. Another correspondent was in Mariupol, described as ""a terrible symbol of the Ukrainian nationalists' inhuman attitudes"", to see an aid distribution centre and hear purported residents' stories of Ukrainian forces using civilians as cover. State-controlled Channel One was also in Mariupol, being told of ""nationalists"" refusing to let people leave and opening fire on those who attempted to. It also reported, quoting Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, that the city administration building has been ""cleansed"". Biolabs and the Biden connection The Ukraine biological warfare laboratories story was once again prominently featured (it was the lead story for Gazprom-Media's NTV). According to the latest information from the Russian Defence Ministry, the research focused on a number of dangerous diseases and how they can be transmitted by insects. The Ministry claimed that unregistered medicines were tested on Ukrainian military personnel. Some of them (described by Rossiya 1 as ""cannon fodder for biological experiments"") reportedly died. A spokesman also alleged that thousands of blood samples were taken to test for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever antibodies. ""An experiment on this scale into a population's natural immunity was most likely conducted for the purpose of selecting the biological agents most dangerous for the population of a defined region,"" he said. But today's main revelation was that the experiments were partly bankrolled by an investment fund headed by President Biden's son Hunter. Rossiya 1 recalled his controversial past role with the energy company Burisma: ""It seems that Hunter Biden's financial interests were not confined to oil and gas but extended to secret military developments.""  Channel One covered the same ground but added that given the secrecy and the nature of the research at these laboratories, ""conspiracy theories about the origin of coronavirus no longer seem absurd."" Western summits Reports about the EU, Nato, and G7 gatherings in Brussels listed the agenda and decisions on further sanctions and aid to Ukraine. ""This summit can by and large be summed up with two words in the English language: fundraising and team-building,"" NTV's correspondent said, explaining that this meant calling for more spending in the face of the ""threat from Russia,"" and talking up their unprecedented unity. She viewed the widening scope of sanctions, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's idea to freeze Russia's gold reserves, which she described as ""a return of the famous British piracy"". Sanctions on the oligarchs have yet to turn them against the Kremlin and polls show consistent public support for Putin and the Ukraine campaign, she said, ""so it looks like they will now be imposed on all of us"". Rossiya 1 noted that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was once again asking for more weapons. However, ""not a word was said about how this will make the conflict even more bloody, nor about Nato's role in the current confrontation."" ""Nato is demanding that Russia allow humanitarian aid to be delivered to Mariupol and provide full and unrestricted humanitarian aid to Ukrainian territory,"" Channel One remarked: ""As if it didn't have its own authorities there."" It noted the talk of the impending use of chemical weapons or worse by Russian forces, dismissing it as an invention. The sole person not to be taken in is ""the prime minister of Slovenia,"" it said, ""but who in Nato will listen to him?""  YouTube censorship The removal of Russian media channels from YouTube was met with condemnation and accusations of discrimination and censorship. ""The blocking of individual creators or their content has been replaced by a near-total ban on the Russian media,"" Rossiya 1 stated. By denying access to the Russian media including us, it said, YouTube and parent company Google are ""preventing people from learning the truth"" about the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. It pointed out that the removed channels had 24 million subscribers in total, ""so the right of a huge number of people to access information has been crudely violated."" NTV accused Google of ""taking upon itself the role of Ministry of Truth"" and added that the ""company is quite explicit that it, and not viewers, will decide what can and cannot be watched."" ""We're no longer on the platform not because we're bad but because we're Russian,"" NTV's head of online services said. Serbia anniversary All the channels pointed out that 24 March is the day on which Nato began its bombing campaign against Serbia in 1999. It lacked UN Security Council approval and was in breach of international law, Rossiya 1 said. ""Hundreds of towns and villages with thousands of civilians were wiped out"" in an operation ""cynically titled Merciful Angel"". An initial wave of strikes against military and dual use targets failed to subjugate the Serbs, after which the alliance started targeting the civilian infrastructure. ""Nato's aviation showed the whole world what humanitarian intervention means,"" Rossiya 1 continued. Madeleine Albright died on the eve of the anniversary. She was US Secretary of State at the time, ""but it is hard to describe her work as diplomacy."" She will always be remembered, a correspondent said, for ""her unconcealed hatred of the Serbs and blatant Russophobia, and her cynical attitude toward half a million children killed in Iraq."" Nobody at Nato remembers the bombing campaign these days but Russia does, Channel One commented. And ""many now recall the events in Serbia in the context of what is happening in Ukraine ... As Time magazine wrote proudly on its cover in 1999, this was bringing the Serbs to heel, concentrated bombing to open the door to peace,"" according to Channel One: ""In Serbia, as in our country, there is much talk today of the West's hypocrisy.""

416,0,Roth mesmerizes and meanders in a mostly toothless movie,689 words,The Washington Post,"You wouldn't know its violent character from the opening scenes of ""Sundown,"" which focus on a family of super-rich tourists vacationing at a luxury Acapulco resort. For Neil (Tim Roth), his sister Alice (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her two adolescent children (Samuel Bottomley and Albertine Kotting McMillan) - all heirs to a prosperous English meatpacking business - this getaway is nothing but sea and swimming, great food, guitar music, gorgeous sunsets and margaritas. All is apparently well with the world. But then an event occurs that triggers Neil (and, predictably, the recognition that this idyllic picture is all an illusion). News arrives of an emergency back home, precipitating the family's mad rush to the airport for a hasty flight home - without Neil, as it turns out, who announces, upon arriving at the airport, that he has forgotten his passport back at the hotel. But there's a strange, zombielike quality to this protagonist's subsequent behavior, after his relatives have flown off and Neil heads not to the resort he just left, but to a seedy motel, where he proceeds to settle in, embarking on a sexual affair with a young woman (Iazua Larios) and whiling the days away drinking beer with her questionable male friends. When it becomes clear that Neil isn't all that eager to rejoin his family - he lies to Alice when she calls, and then starts ghosting her completely, for weeks - the question becomes: Why? Franco is clearly interested in highlighting the disparity between the opening scenes of wealth and the milieu of tawdriness and squalor in which the rest of the film is set - as well as Neil's affectless reaction to it. When a man is gunned down in broad daylight on the beach, in a drive-by speedboat shooting, Neil stares at the bloody body with less reaction than one might have over a washed-up horseshoe crab. Is he a sociopath? Is there something wrong with him physically? (Later developments suggest that there may be.) Or is he simply a convenient symbol of the apathetic haves in Franco's allegory of the have-nots? Scenes of pigs wandering into Neil's encounters - hallucinations, perhaps, or heavy-handed metaphors for both the slaughterhouse and obscene wealth - add a patina of social critique, but it's generally toothless. ""Sundown"" is at its most engrossing as an individual portrait, even if its inscrutable subject is a person to whom virtually no (sane) viewer will relate. Roth is still a great and mesmerizing actor, even when he's drifting, vacantly, through a hellscape. Given his rÃ©sumÃ©, Franco seems to be commenting on class and other social divisions. The film's title could refer to the sundown of the ruling elite. Then again, it may also refer to the phenomenon of ""sundowning,"" a state of late-afternoon mental confusion common to dementia patients. Is Neil a stand-in for the one-percent, whose days may or may not be numbered? Or is he just losing his mind? Franco's director's statement calls the film at once a ""character study,"" a ""study of family dynamics"" and an ""exploration of all perspectives present in Acapulco."" But the writer-director - or at least his film - is a bit too diffuse for any one of those things to make much of an impact. michael.osullivan@washpost.com R. At area theaters.

75,0,"When COVID hit, they fled to the 'burbs. Now, they're scrambling for city rentals",844 words,The Toronto Star,"But as some employers in the Toronto core are calling staff back to the office - at least a couple of days a week - some employees regret the big move away, several realtors told the Star, andare now trying to find a second place in the city. ""They're people who bought in Whitby ... they bought a house, but then they realize their job wants them to be in the office half the week,"" said Nasma Ali, a Toronto broker and founder of One Group, a real estate agency. She said she's been approached by single people who bought homes outside the Toronto core and are now looking for rentals downtown as they've been called back to work. ""Instead of selling their house, they're thinking they're going to rent out their house, and rent downtown to be closer to the office,"" said Ali. ""It's not just the commute ... it's also gas,"" she said, as gas prices have risen due to the invasion of Ukraine, leading to much more costly commutes. Mila Sheina, a real estate agent and broker at The Spring Team, says some clients who bought elsewhere are looking for micro-condos to live in a few days a week while at the office. ""They're the size of an office pod, with a toilet. I actually have a guy who lives somewhere far away, who is looking to purchase a place downtown just so he can come there when he's driving down to Toronto (to) work,"" said Sheina. Nicole Li, a Toronto realtor at HomeLife Landmark Realty, said although her clients aren't looking for a second place downtown, many who are under 35 and went to live with their parents during the pandemic are now looking to move back to the city as soon as possible. ""Everyone just wants to move to downtown Toronto again, and that's why the prices have been going up,"" she said. In recent months, Toronto condo prices have surged, increasing 16.4 per cent year over year in the fourth quarter of 2021 and reaching an average of $710,087, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board. At the same time, the price of a one-bedroom rental in Toronto has increased by 13.7 per cent to $2,099, according to TRREB. Saeid Hashemi, a volunteer at More Neighbours, an affordable housing advocacy group, said a solution is to ensure that multiple types of housing are available to increase supply, so there is less concern over a person buying multiple properties and taking up stock. ""The reason we have this, is a shortage generally,"" he said. ""We're essentially playing musical chairs with our housing stock ... more for someone, means less for someone else,"" he said. If that supply was there, it's not necessarily a bad thing to have people live closer to where their jobs are, as reducing commutes is better for the environment, he added. However, Mark Richardson, a volunteer technical lead with advocacy group HousingNowTO, said the number of people looking for a second, smaller unit in the core is likely not significant enough to cause any major disruptions. He said younger people are returning to the city in droves, particularly university and college students in the next few months, which will have a bigger impact on the rental market. ""There are only so many people who sold up and moved out of town, and there are only so many of those people who are being told they have to come back to the office, 220 days a year downtown,"" he said, as many companies continue with flexible work-from-home arrangements. And despite the conundrum these employees now find themselves in, those who were able to work from home and buy into the market outside the city are still the ones to have benefited from the market during the pandemic, said Nemoy Lewis, an assistant professor at the school of urban and regional planning at Ryerson University. ""You have a situation like this where you have folks that were able to work from home, able to keep there jobs, were able to afford homes in the suburbs and then rent units in the downtown core."" Interest rates in 2020 were at record lows, which benefited upper and middle class people seeking to get into the market, said Lewis, while many lower income people lost their jobs or were evicted. ""It goes to show you the failures of the system itself and policies to adequately allocate housing in this city,"" he said."

446,0,Man is stabbed dead as brawl erupts inside; restaurant; Brooklyn pol hits troubled eatery,294 words,New York Daily News,"The quarrel started inside the restaurant and quickly spilled outside, cops said. When police arrived, they found a 22-year-old man sprawled out on the ground with a stab wound to the chest. A second man, also 22, had a deep gash to the head. EMS took both men to NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn, where the man knifed in the chest died. His name was not immediately released. The other man was treated for a minor injury. Cops were still trying to determine what caused the fight. The man who was killed has no criminal history, a police source said. Most of the brawlers fled down Third Ave. and no arrests have been made. Cops were scouring the area Saturday looking for surveillance footage. City Councilman Justin Brannan (D-Bay Ridge) said the fatal brawl was ""part of a well-documented and dangerous pattern of illegal and reckless behavior from this establishment over the years."" ""It is clear that the owners of Catrinas have no intention of following the law, no regard for the neighborhood in which they operate, and even less regard for keeping their own customers safe,"" Brannan said on Facebook. ""To that end, I will be working with my colleagues in government to have Catrinas liquor license revoked."" A call to the restaurant for comment Saturday afternoon was not returned."
95,1,"Alliancebernstein National Municipal Income Fund Inc. - Conference Call Transcript | Dividend Decrease March 29, 2022",815 words,Public Companies News and Documents via PUBT,"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND CONFERENCE CALL TRANSCRIPT March 29, 2022 4:30 p.m. ET Operator : This is Conference # 6393235 . Operator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to the AllianceBernstein National Municipal Income Fund Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during that session, please press star 1 on your telephone. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. If you require any further assistance, please press star zero. I would now turn the call over to your first speaker for today, Mr. Jason Mertz. Go ahead. Jason Mertz: Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Jason Mertz, and I'm the Tax Exempt Fixed Income Product Manager at AllianceBernstein. A short while ago, we issued a press release that declared monthly dividends, and advised of a dividend decrease from our National Municipal Closed-End Fund. To restate the contents of that press release, the dividend of the AllianceBernstein National Municipal Income Fund has been decreased from 0.05326 cents to 0.04479 cents per share. I'm joined on the call with Terry Hults, Senior Vice President and co-Head of Portfolio Management at AllianceBernstein. As soon as I concluded my prepared remarks, we will open up the line for questions for members of the analyst community. All other callers will be in listen-only mode. For the AllianceBernstein National Municipal Income Fund, the dividend rate is set to reflect as closely as possible our assessment of the portfolio's current and projected earnings power. The portfolio is position based upon what we believe is consistent with the appropriate risk levels and valuations in the marketplace. There are two major drivers of the fund's earning power. The first is the cost of short-term borrowing associated with leverage, and the second is the level of market interest rates as it relates to bonds owned by the fund. We have not adjusted the dividends since the last dividend increase in May of 2020. While yields for most bonds have risen this year, they are still generally low by historical standards, and have not risen by as much as short-term financing costs are expected to increase. The cost of short-term borrowing is heavily influenced by the Federal Reserve and the Fed funds target rate, which is expected to increase quickly as we've begun a monetary tightening cycle. The index of short-term municipal rates that relates to our cost of leverage range from 0.02 percent to 0.11 percent last year. Current market levels imply this rate will increase to over 1 percent within the next 12 months. As short-term municipal rates increase so do the funds borrowing costs. Additionally, the municipal yield curve has flattened significantly, reducing the spread between short-term financing costs and longer-term bond yields. Consistent with the assessment of the funds future earning power, a dividend reduction is necessary at this time. At this time, I would like to open up the line for questions from the analyst community. Operator: Again, if you have a question press star 1. At this time, there are no questions. Jason Mertz: Thank you. In addition, a written summary of today's call will be available on our website www.alliancebernstein.com[http://www.alliancebernstein.com] within 24 hours. Once again, I would like to thank you for joining us today and for your continued support for us. This concludes our call today. Operator: Thank you for attending today's conference.

Also, for the month of March, Volkswagen delivered 655,800 units worldwide, down 31% from 955,300 the same month in 2021.

There is therefore still a risk that further developments in the Ukraine war will have a negative impact on the Volkswagen Group's business activities. This may also result from bottlenecks in the supply chain. The further development of the commodity markets also remains unpredictable, which in turn may have significant effects on the measurement of hedging instruments. In addition, negative effects may continue to result from a worsening Covid-19 pandemic and from the supply situation - especially for semiconductors,"" the company stated.

784,0,News Corp Emails Hacked In Attack Linked to China,572 words,The New York Times,"The hack was disclosed in a securities filing on Friday. The company said it had discovered the attack on one of its systems in January. David Kline, News Corp's chief technology officer, said in an email to staff members on Friday that the company had notified U.S. law enforcement and opened an investigation with the digital security firm Mandiant after the discovery. Mr. Kline said the company believed the breach had affected ''a limited number'' of email accounts and documents from News Corp headquarters, News Technology Services, Dow Jones, News UK and The New York Post. Other News Corp properties, like News Corp Australia, HarperCollins Publishers and Storyful, were not believed to have been affected. ''Our preliminary analysis indicates that foreign government involvement may be associated with this activity, and that some data was taken,'' Mr. Kline wrote in the email, which was viewed by The New York Times. ''Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus and believes they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests.'' Mr. Kline said that the company believed the threat had been contained and that customer and financial data had not been hacked. ''Even though the vast majority of our people's emails and documents were not the target of this attack activity, we take seriously any attack on our organization and our employees, including our journalists,'' Mr. Kline wrote in the email. Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in an email that he was not aware of the reported details about the hack. ''We hope that there can be a professional, responsible and evidence-based approach to identifying cyber-related incidents, rather than making allegations based on speculations,'' Mr. Pengyu said. Escalating tensions between China and the United States in recent years have ensnared the news media. In 2020, China expelled American reporters working for The Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post by canceling their media credentials, forcing out more than a dozen journalists. Earlier, the Trump administration limited the number of Chinese citizens who could work in the United States for state-run Chinese news agencies that are considered to be propaganda outlets. The United States and China agreed in November to ease the restrictions on foreign journalists in each country, which was expected to allow The Times, The Journal and The Post to send some reporters back to China. However, foreign journalists in China are facing ''unprecedented hurdles,'' including increased intimidation and harassment for doing their jobs, according to a report released on Jan. 31 by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China. ''The Chinese state continues to find new ways to intimidate foreign correspondents, their Chinese colleagues and those whom the foreign press seeks to interview, via online trolling, physical assaults, cyber hacking and visa denials,'' the report said."
771,1,Russell Bond & Co. transitions to Jencap after acquisition,433 words,Buffalo Business First,"Gary Hollederer, president of the Buffalo branch and former president and COO of Russell Bond, said the acquisition happened during a time when the employee-owned company was struggling. âWe were challenged in getting clients and just running a business and having the capital and resources to attract new products,ï¿½?he said. âThe only way for the company to continue was to merge with someone that was building that kind of clout in the market."" Hollederer said other companies were interested in acquiring Russell Bond, but Jencap's culture seemed to be a match. âEverybody here has a responsibility, a job description, to build relationships,ï¿½?Hollederer said. âIn our segment of the industry as a wholesale broker, we have a very strong reputation with our clients. Also, weâve always created opportunities for our employees and allow them to build a career. Thatâs what Jencap has done.ï¿½?Jencap has 900 employees and 49 offices across the country, but this is the company's first venture into Western New York, Hollederer said. Russell Bond has 38 local employees and 44 total. âThe acquisition of Russell Bond brings additional depth to Jencap, aligns with our ongoing growth strategy and adds to the breadth of diversified products and services that we provide our agency partners,"" Jencap President Mark Maher said in a statement. Jencap was interested in Russell Bond because it was an ""untapped market"" for the company, which plans to continue growing through acquisitions to create âboutique wholesalers,"" Hollederer said. âThey want to match the cultures of the communities that they operate in,ï¿½?Hollederer said. In turn, Russell Bond will benefit from access to larger capital and from Jencap's commitment to investing in the local workforce. âFor our people, it offers them a career within the organization,"" Hollederer said. ""Weâre investing in people now that we werenât able to do before.ï¿½?Hollederer said heâs planning to hire two more employees, with the potential to add more as growth continues. The local company will also rebrand to Jencap Specialty Insurance Services. âOur people arenât changing, and our philosophy isnât changing; just the name and the fact that we now have more products and solutions to offer,ï¿½?he said.

792,1,The challenge of corporate sustainability,748 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"All these efforts are valuable, and as a gateway they can lead to greater actions, results and/or impacts; however, without a true conviction of senior management and, even more so, of the owners and investors of the company, their scope will be limited and they will not reach a true transformation of their business model that makes it compatible with the triple bottom line (economic, social and environmental). Today, beyond socially responsible actions, programs, products or services, what we need are new business models that, without neglecting profitability, productivity or competitiveness, are committed to making a positive contribution to social development, as well as to the care and conservation of the environment. It is in these two spheres that we can find ever greater risks (and, if well addressed, also opportunities) for those companies that accept the challenges of corporate sustainability. To begin with, it must be recognized and accepted that, by the simple fact of operating, a company is generating impacts (positive and negative) to its environment, either by the products or services it offers, the inputs it consumes in its operations, the waste it generates, the destination of its investments, or the relationship it maintains with suppliers, partners or distributors, among others. All the impacts derived from this must be identified and properly managed with the intention of generating value for both the company and its stakeholders, thus promoting the sustainability of the business and its permanence in the future. One thing that helps in this regard is the progress that has been made in terms of regulation and the requirement in some markets for companies to be accountable and transparent with this information, which has triggered the development of various methodologies, guidelines and standards for measuring and reporting sustainability. Even now, the focus is being given to how sustainability-related issues (e.g., climate change, human rights, anti-corruption, among many others) affect the short- and long-term financial performance of the business, information that is much more valuable to analysts, evaluators and investors in general. Another element that I think it is important to highlight is the relevance that the topic has been gaining in the financial sector, mainly in banks, insurance companies, investment funds, stock exchanges, etc., who have been adopting ""sustainable investment"" principles to incorporate ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) in their products and services, processes and decisions, with which they can generate a multiplier effect and drive the rest of the economy towards this approach. On the other hand, we can also find sectors of society that are much more aware of the social and environmental issues that affect them and that consequently move them to commit themselves to such causes, generating pressure or resistance from civil society organizations, consumer groups or representatives of local communities, against those companies with practices contrary to or negative impacts on their interests. In view of all these elements, those companies that remain reluctant to incorporate sustainability into their business models will be losing valuable time and falling behind those that decidedly do so, since eventually the markets and the requirements of their stakeholders are moving in this direction. This undoubtedly affects the viability and permanence of the business and therefore should be one of the priorities of the top management of any company.

USE YOUR INITIATIVE Carter also suggests employees take advantage of the talent shortage by reaching out to businesses they want to work for. âRather than waiting to be headhunted, consider whether this is a good time to find a recruiter that you trust and work with them exclusively to find a new role,ï¿½?Carter says. âGet on the front foot and investigate who are the businesses that you want to work for and target them.ï¿½?EXPERT A COUNTER OFFER Careers expert and Outplacement Australia director Gillian Kelly says workers who are headhunted should expect a counter offer from their existing employer in a bid to get them to stay. She says while itâs flattering to be pursued by multiple companies, and offers of increased salary can be persuasive, it is important to consider the long-term career opportunities before switching jobs. If nothing else, being headhunted can give workers a better sense of what they may be worth, she says. DECLINE WITH GRACE If an approach is unwanted, politely decline but suggest the recruiter keep in touch, says Kelly. âI know there are workers in some high-demand areas that get lots and lots of InMails (messages from recruiters) but ghosting them is not something I would recommend,âï¿½?she says. âUnwanted approaches are not a bad thing. âThere will be a time where you may well be needing to go out and look for an opportunity and that recruiter might be an invaluable connection. âSo just thank them for reaching out and letting you know that an opportunity exists but tell them you want to remain in your current job.ï¿½?HOW TO FIND THE RIGHT TALENT The irony of the headhunter becoming the headhunted is not lost on Chloe Spillane. The talent acquisition manager received more than 30 approaches to join rival companies before she was finally persuaded to move to tech recruiter Talent. âI was really happy at the recruitment agency where I was, I was feeling quite fulfilled in my role and I wasnât looking to move at all,âï¿½?she says. âBut with this specific message (from Talent), I was intrigued. âI could see the growth potential in this role and that I could really accelerate my career and take my development to the next level.âï¿½?After several meetings with Talent management, Spillane says she spoke with her existing company, who confirmed they could not match the opportunity she had been offered. Now responsible for headhunting other candidates to join Talent, and keenly aware that quality workers receive ï¿½?0-plus emails a dayï¿½?from recruiters, Spillane takes care to send personal messages to those she targets, saying bulk messages can be a deterrent. She says those who include photos on their LinkedIn profiles, along with clear job titles, a full career history and a description of their current skills and responsibilities, are most likely to be viewed favourably by recruiters. âThereâs been a real candidate shortage since the pandemic and weâve seen a massive reduction in applicants for roles so headhunting is going to be very much a part of the (hiring process in the) future,ï¿½?Spillane says."
862,0,Neil Young demands Spotify remove his music over Joe Rogan 'disinformation',292 words,Agence France Presse,"""I want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform,"" Young, 76, continued. ""They can have Rogan or Young. Not both."" The letter, which has since been removed from Young's website, was first reported by Rolling Stone late Monday. Spotify has not replied to an AFP query regarding the musician's request. As of Tuesday Young's music is still on the platform. Rogan's podcast racks up millions of listens -- he signed a reported $100 million deal with Spotify last year -- but critics say it is a platform for peddling conspiracy theories and disinformation, particularly over Covid-19. Rogan has discouraged vaccination in younger people and promoted the off-label use of the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin to treat the virus. In December 270 doctors, physicians and professors signed an open letter to Spotify asking the service to ""moderate misinformation on its platform."" ""It is a sociological issue of devastating proportions and Spotify is responsible for allowing this activity to thrive on its platform,"" read the letter. Young, citing sound quality issues, removed much of his music from Spotify in 2015 but later relented, saying ""that's where people get music."" He has his own online archive of all of his music that fans can subscribe to. mdo/mlm"

962,0,EPIDEMIOLOGIST URGES DELAY IN RETURN TO SCHOOL,657 words,Dominion Post,"University of Otago epidemiologist Amanda Kvalsvig said all schools, including early childhood facilities, should delay reopening after the summer break until ""basic protections"" were in place. Kvalsvig said more time is needed to vaccinate five to 11-year-olds, give booster shots to older students and education staff, ensure carbon dioxide monitors and air filters are installed in classrooms, and for high-grade N95 masks and rapid antigen testing to be available in schools. Schools across the country are due to reopen their gates between Monday, January 31 and Tuesday, February 8. Yesterday, Queensland delayed its school reopening for two weeks, in light of a surge of cases being reported in the state on Sunday. In New Zealand, five to 11-year-olds will start receiving their jabs from January 17, with nearly half a million children in that age group eligible. Covid-19 duty minister Grant Robertson said at this stage, all schools would reopen as planned. ""The Government is constantly reviewing and talking to officials and experts about the Covid-19 response, particularly in light of Omicron,"" Robertson said. But Kvalsvig said information from overseas showed Omicron triggering ""an avalanche of child cases, at higher rates than previously seen in this pandemic"". Schools and hospitals were struggling to manage the high rates of infection overseas and there were rising concerns about lasting effects in children, including Long Covid and autoimmune problems like diabetes. ""Here in New Zealand we have an opportunity to break that pattern, but we need to be decisive and move fast."" But a number of paediatricians disagree. Developmental Paediatrician Dr Jin Russell said schools should reopen on time, given there was no community outbreak of Omicron, and relatively low cases of Delta. ""Prolonged school closures can be harmful for children's wellbeing and development . . . Educational inequalities are something that's been seen overseas in the pandemic, and when children can't see their friends they can suffer emotionally and psychologically. So school closures are, I think, an action of last resort."" Australian paediatricians treating children with Covid-19 have said the acute health risk of Covid-19 was akin to influenza, Russell said. ""Obviously we want infection levels in children as low as possible, but it means that thinking about what's best for children, we would not typically close schools for influenza."" Dr Danny de Lore, paediatrician and chair of the Indigenous Child Health Working Group for the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, said New Zealand could see disagreement between experts on how schools should respond to Omicron. ""I think from an indigenous perspective, I would be really keen for schools to be open on time, but there may be a role for local closures, which would be hopefully brief."" Professor Peter McIntyre, a paediatrician specialising in infectious disease, said delaying a return to school was an ""overreaction"". ""The harms to children from that move are way, way higher than any benefit in disease prevention. There will be some parents who feel very anxious and will decide themselves to keep their children at home, particularly if they have some underlying medical condition - I'm not criticising that, but [closures] are not in the best interest of the child.""  New Zealand Principals' Federation president Cherie Taylor-Patel said Omicron was a ""dilemma"" for schools. ""On the one hand you want schools to reopen smoothly without delays and fuss, after the trials and tribulations of 2021, with such a disruptive year."" She was hopeful at least two-thirds of New Zealand's five- to 11-year-olds would be vaccinated before going back to school. ""What happens in the next two weeks is critical."""

""We continue to contend with extended lead times, transportation challenges, intermittent lockdowns in China due to covid, and are successfully handling price increases due to inflation. Despite the challenging global environment, we delivered strong growth in net sales, up 28.9% year over year. Through disciplined cost control, we drove a 28.8% increase in gross profit versus the prior year and gross margins remained flat at 28.2% in Q1. ""While supply chain challenges and the global semiconductor chip shortages have affected our business and the industry, both Surge and Challenge have excelled at delivering our products to clients with shorter lead times compared to our competitors.

""We continue to closely monitor the global situation and the lingering effects of the pandemic. The health and safety of our people and clients are of the utmost importance, and we remain committed to implementing appropriate COVID safety protocols across our global footprint.

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended February 28, 2022 Net sales for the three months ended February 28, 2022 increased by 28.9% to $10.5 million, as compared to net sales of $8.2 million for the three months ended February 28, 2021. The increase in net sales for the three-month period is primarily attributable to an increase in business with new customers as well as an increase in business with existing customers. Gross profit for the three months ended February 28, 2022 increased by 28.8% to $3.0 million, as compared to $2.3 million for the three months ended February 28, 2021. Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales remained flat at 28.2% for the three months ended February 28, 2022, as compared to the three months ended February 28, 2021.

General and administrative expenses for the three months ended February 28, 2022 increased 4.6% to $1.3 million, as compared to $1.2 million for three months ended February 28, 2021. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to increases in rent, temporary help and general insurance expenses, professional fees as well as salaries and related payroll taxes, directors fees and public company expenses, offset by decreases in settlement expenses due to a settlement with a customer in the three months ended February 28, 2021. Net income for the three months ended February 28, 2022 was $671,753, as compared to net income of $277,664 for the three months ended February 28, 2021.

620,0,Government demands tech giants pull Russian state media,933 words,The Age - Online,"Apple and Snapchat were also told to remove RT, formerly known as Russia Today, and Sputnik, the successor to Voice of Russia. ""I am writing to ask that [your company] takes action as a priority to suspend the dissemination on your platform[s] in Australia of content generated by Russian state media organisations, given that there has been a significant volume of such content promoting violence, extremism and disinformation in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" Mr Fletcher said in a letter sent on Thursday afternoon. The minister wrote that he wanted confirmation from the platforms as soon as possible that they had complied with his request. The move comes days after Australian TV networks Foxtel and SBS voluntarily pulled Russian state-owned news services, RT and Sputnik, from their services. Russian services have also been blocked or restricted by Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube in Europe, following a request from the European Commission. ""Given the current actions of the Russian government, and the lack of genuinely independent Russian media, these actions are responsible and appropriate,"" Mr Fletcher wrote. ""In light of the exceptional circumstances that are unfolding in Ukraine, and in the interests of protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Australian government asks that [your company] takes such action in respect of content disseminated on your platform[s] in Australia."" Earlier this week, Mr Fletcher urged the technology platforms to act responsibly and reminded them to adhere to the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation. A government source said at the time that more action would be taken if the platforms did not remove the content voluntarily. Media experts including Macquarie professor Peter Greste have previously warned a ban such as this would be counterproductive because it could lead to retaliation against Western reporters in Russia. Bermet Talant, journalist and researcher at the Alliance for Journalists' Freedom, who spent more than four years working in Ukraine, said banning state-based media was not the answer. ""Blanket censorship isn't a good approach,"" she said. ""What social media should do in this case is enforce their policies ï¿½?and those outlets should be vetted for disinformation, threats and other violations of social media policies. Russian propaganda is not limited to RT [and] Sputnik."" A Meta spokesperson said: ""We're reviewing the request from the Australian government. In the meantime, we will continue to label and fact check these outlets as well as prohibit ads and demonetise their accounts globally, including in Australia."" Meta wrote to Mr Fletcher on Thursday, offering him time to discuss the measures in detail or any specific concerns. Mr Fletcher did not request a meet with Meta.  Google, TikTok and Twitter. In a blog post from Snap on Tuesday, the company said it had never allowed Russian state media to distribute content on its âDiscover' page. ""We are vigilantly monitoring our platform for any evidence of disinformation or misuse while we focus on providing accurate news coverage and information to our global community through our partnerships with media publishers on our Discover content platform,"" the blog post said. ""On Discover, we only feature content from verified media partners and creators, and we have never allowed Russian state media to distribute content.""  Google said in a separate post earlier this week that it had blocked YouTube channels connected to RT and Sputnik across Europe and indefinitely paused monetisation of Russian state-funded media across its platforms in addition to removing hundreds of channels and thousands of videos for violating its guidelines. In a statement, Apple said it was deeply concerned about the invasion and stood with all people suffering. It would communicate with governments about its responses. ""RT News and Sputnik News are no longer available for download from the App Store outside Russia,"" the statement reads. At least one other app linked to the outlets, Sputnik Trending, remains on the store. The major technology companies have fact-checking processes, label content from state media, remove content that breaches their policies on misinformation and have diminished the reach of Russian media. RT says on its website that it is an autonomous, non-profit organisation that covers stories overlooked by the mainstream media and provides an alternative perspective on current affairs. Sputnik says it is a ""modern news agency"" that delivers global political and economic news. In its coverage of the restrictions placed on its social media presence, Sputnik quoted from Russia's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzya, who said the state faced an ""information war"". Opposition communications spokeswoman Michelle Rowland said she supported the government's consultation with media and social media companies.""It is appropriate that the Minister correspond formally with digital platforms on matters of such grave import,"" Ms Rowland said. ""Labor has sought a briefing from government."" The Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day's trading. Get it each weekday afternoon."
32,0,Cybercrime Significantly Increases With Abundant Internet Use: DG FIA,826 words,The Nation,"He informed this while addressing at concluding session of international conference on emerging trends in information and engineering technologies organised under the auspices of Sindh University's Dr Abdul Hussain Shah Bukhari Postgraduate Centre in collaboration with Sindh Higher Education Commission (HEC). The Director General FIA said that there were many challenges posed to the agency on account of limited resources adding that he was trying to overcome human and financial issues so as to work more effectively. 'There is a need to raise awareness among the youth to prevent cyber crimes and the role of university cannot be ignored in this regard', he observed. Dr Abbasi discussed in detail the cyber crime, its laws, punishments, the number of complaints registered with the FIA and the modus operandi for lodging the grouses. He said that the procedure for filing complaints with FIA was easy. 'Complaints can be lodged online by visiting the organisation's website while the same can also be made through correspondence,' he maintained. He said that the students in majority had been found to lodge the complaints regarding cyber crime, for which he said steps were taken in accordance with the nature of the cases to halt such things. The Director General FIA said that he also wanted to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the University of Sindh to work together on cyber security, under which the internship opportunities could be provided to the graduates and undergraduates of the varsity. Dr Abbasi said that recently 90,000 applications were received from the youth across the country for internship in the FIA, which he said showed the confidence of the job-seekers upon the agency. 'We want our indigenous solution to cyber security and crimes; we do not hinge on external assistance about different difficult cases in future too,' he maintained. He said that the role of the University of Sindh could prove vital in making own mechanism and way forward for indigenous solution of the problems. He said that due to COVID-19, the entire budget was transferred by the government to the health department, as a result of which he said no significant grants were received to FIA for the prevention of cyber crime. He said that cyber space patrol was also being carried out by FIA adding that currently, many social cyber activities were detected and thwarted by the agency. The FIA is working on involving university volunteers and internees to create awareness among the students and general public, he informed. He said that with the increasing use of technology and the proliferation of smart phones and gadgets, the number of cyber crime complaints received by the Federal Investigation Agency from all over the country during 2021 were recorded over 1,00000. Only social site Facebook was used as a medium for cyber crime with 23 percent of the total complaints, he said. Dr Abbasi said the increase in cyber crime reporting was reflection of public confidence on the agency adding that not only general public but law enforcing agencies also contacted with the agency in this context as it was the only platform to investigate into cyber crime cases and communicate with international law enforcement agencies. The Vice Chancellor University of Sindh Prof Dr Muhammad Siddique Kalhoro while accepting the offer of DG FIA regarding inking of MoU with FIA said the Memorandum of Understanding would soon be signed between the two organisations for the benefit of university students. He said that the varsity would extend its all out cooperation with FIA in increasing manpower as well as human resources and providing it with talented youth so that the agency could become more powerful and effective in dealing with cyber crimes. On the last day of the conference different sessions were held in which many local and foreign scholars read their research papers both online and on-site.

555,0,Food blogger creates ultimate Google Doc for dining out in Dublin,1219 words,RTE.ie,"Click to access link.[//instagram.com/p/CY10SkuMW7X/embed/]  Thankfully, food blogger and cookbook author Nicola Halloran (aka The Wonky Spatula) has stepped in to help us with our social diaries. With her new Instagram page, Dublin Plates, she is providing tips for dining out in Dublin and an incredible Google Doc[https://docs-google-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/spreadsheets/d/1RSuGr1MYJNDkpbBNKjOX0xAGywuUF8LOyfQ1iZiW-t0/edit#gid=78178966] that lists a heap of restaurants along with a price guide and handy notes. For example, if you're looking for looking for a bite to eat before heading to the Aviva, you may enjoy Asador; if you want a cocktail with friends before heading out for the night (when restrictions allow), you should check out Fika in Bray; or if you're looking to splash out on a special date night, Bresson in Monkstown may be the ticket. We caught up with Nicola to find out more about her impressive project. How did the idea for Dublin Plates come about? When hospitality began to open up again during the summer, I found myself naturally making lists of places that I wanted to return to or visit for the first time. At the same time, I also found myself giving lots of recommendations to friends and family so I decided to start compiling a central list. The idea to flesh out the detail and open it up to the public was really to be able to support the industry in some shape or form. We have so many amazing restaurants that deserve to be celebrated and with so much uncertainty on such an on-going basis, anything we can do to support be it big or small is sure to be appreciated.  Click to access link.[//instagram.com/p/CYzFpc6MbMi/embed/]  Is this free for anyone to access? What makes this project worthwhile to you? The list is totally free, no strings attached. You can access it via Google Sheets - I especially like how it appears on the app on my phone as you can easily browse on the move. You can go on and filter by location, cuisine, rating - you name it! For example, if you wanted to see all restaurants in Dublin 2 you simply select from the location filter. From there you can then filter down further, for example, if you were in the mood for bites & cocktails. What makes it worthwhile to me? Being about to contribute in a small way to helping the hospitality industry get back on its feet, and hear from people who try delicious new places too! How do you decide which restaurants make the cut? At the moment I've included a list of places I have been to recently, easily 95% of which have been during Covid times. It's important for me that the list is up to date and relevant. Of the very small percent that were pre-Covid, they were iconic places that I just had to include such as The Greenhouse. I'm really interested to see where they go next and as it was honestly one of the best meals of my life I couldn't write the list without it. You'll see the future hit-list tab, which lists places that are soon to be added. These are a mix of places that I've either been recommended to try or have extensively stalked on Instagram! I would love, over time, for users of the list to share their recommendations with me too so that we can create a really lovely community of food lovers.  Click to access link.[//instagram.com/p/CYj8BHFrSrG/embed/]  How does the rating system work? The ratings are all my own opinions based on my experience of each location, I take a number of things into consideration, such as the price (value for money), location, venue, atmosphere, food, and overall experience to arrive at my score. It's also worth noting that the ratings are based on the categories so you could have a 10/10 for a burrito joint and a 10/10 for a fine dining tasting menu - both of which excel in their own niche but would be vastly different experiences. I've made a conscious decision that if I arrive at a rating of five or less they won't make the list - I want it to be a positive place for people to get inspiration. Of course, I will share my feedback with the venue privately so that they can learn and address it. and will gladly consider returning to see if my feelings change as I do believe things can happen on the day and everyone deserves a second chance.  Click to access link.[//instagram.com/p/CYq_pw1sZ0b/embed/]  Anything surprise you about the restaurants in Dublin? I adore the pace at which the Irish food scene is evolving, you could go out every night for a year and not eat the same meal twice. For me, a really interesting one to watch is the pace at which burger and sandwich offerings are popping up, it feels like a total 180 from three or four years ago when it was salad bar season - and I'm not complaining in the slightest! any tips for people dining during Covid? Definitely, I would encourage everyone to make bookings and call in advance as there is a lot of uncertainty at the moment, particularly where some restaurants have taken extended Christmas breaks. How often will you be updating the Google Doc? Weekly, if I can! Currently, I have 88 restaurants on the list and another handful that I have ready to add. Then the plan from there is to tick off the hit list one by one.  Click to access link.[//instagram.com/p/CXQuUqjBW_U/embed/]  What are your favourite gems at the moment? A stand out meal of late has to be Pichet, we were there a few weeks ago and it was absolutely flawless from start to finish; Harry Quinn is doing a stellar job and the floor staff we so lovely, as always. We really were treated like royalty. Alongside this, I have to say hot on my list is Bastible. We did the dinner box a little while ago and I am dying to get back in for an in-person feed. I'm also not behind the door in sharing my love for a good burger or sandwich - Hush Rathmines is the place to go for both. I had the opportunity to collab with them on a charity sandwich in the summer so got a feel for what goes on behind the scenes too. it's a great place and definitely one to watch for 2022 as they release more of their test-kitchen creations.  Where are your favourite spots to eat in Dublin?[https://img.rasset.ie/001ad881-800.jpg]"
816,0,Forrest fights Facebook over scam,373 words,The Australian,"The advertisements have coincided with a boom in speculative investment in cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately for many unsophisticated investors, high prices for cryptocurrencies have come crashing back to earth in recent months as investment markets are repriced in anticipation of higher interest rates in the US. Mr Forrest is one of the few individuals who can afford to use the courts to attempt to bring companies such as Facebook to account. But he is not the only famous person caught in the online get-rich-quick scam web of lies. Mr Forrest deserves respect for taking on the difficult task of bringing what he considers a criminal enterprise before the courts in Australia and California.  Facebook claims that, like Mr Forrest, it is opposed to the advertisements, does not endorse them and has tried to weed them out. It remains to be seen how the courts will deal with Mr Forrestâs complaint alleging the social media giant breached anti-money laundering laws with its algorithms funnelling unsuspecting victims to cryptocurrency scams. Regardless of what the courts decide, the online trap is further evidence that Big Tech has been able to act in a way that is outside of the normal bounds of business. Traditional publishers quickly would be brought to account if they attempted to publish the sort of unregulated investment advice claiming fake celebrity endorsements as Facebook has done. It is further justification for online media giants to be treated as publishers, not carriers, with all the legal obligations that entails."
356,0,Former Doyle's restaurant to become Fat Les's,404 words,The Canadian Press,"An American not-for-profit organization called Strong Towns advocates for the building of more appropriate and sustainable infrastructure, housing, and economic development, amongst other things. An article posted to their website strongly argues that small businesses are the lifeblood of small towns. The reasons for this are many. Small businesses, of course, contribute to local taxes, but often in more ways than one. The owners of these local businesses often live in town as well, and thus pay residential property tax, and have children who go to local schools. They are often typically invested in keeping the town active and vibrant, as this contributes to the success of their business. In terms of the local economy, estimates suggest that small businesses account for more than 60% of new jobs created. When these jobs are filled by people who live locally, it can eliminate the negative environmental aspects of commuting to work, and can encourage small towns to grow, as many people wish to settle in the same communities in which they work. With a town the size of Chesterville, even one commercial building sitting vacant can cause significant hurt for the community. Not only does it represent lost jobs, it is also aesthetically unappealing for tourists and others who might otherwise want to explore the town on foot, and spend their money. Having a vacant space filled is, therefore, of tremendous importance and significance. One can only hope that Fat Lesâs sees success in their newest location in the heart of Chesterville!"

As detailed below, the lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) that the technical report for Gatos's primary mine, the Cerro Los Gatos deposit, contained certain errors; (2) that, among other things, the mineral reserves had been overestimated by as much as 50%; and (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. In October 2020, Gatos conducted its IPO, selling approximately 24,644,500 shares of common stock at a price of $7.00 per share. On January 25, 2022, after the market closed, Gatos Silver revealed that ""there were errors in the technical report entitled âLos Gatos Project, Chihuahua, Mexico' with an effective date of July 1, 2020 . . . , as well as indications that there is an overestimation in the existing resource model."" On a preliminary basis, the Company estimates a potential reduction of the metal content of the mineral reserve ranging from 30% to 50% of the metal content remaining after depletion. On this news, the Company's stock price fell $7.02, or 69%, to close at $3.17 per share on January 26, 2022, on unusually heavy trading volume. By the commencement of this action, Gatos shares were trading as low as $3.20 per share, a nearly 54% decline from the $7.00 per share IPO price. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class.

After such review and consideration, the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee recommends that the Board of Directors select the slate of director nominees. The Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee does not have an express policy with regard to consideration of director candidates recommended by Shareholders, but it will consider director candidates proposed by Shareholders in the same manner as it considers other candidates. The Board of Directors and the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee believe that candidates must be highly qualified, exhibiting the experience and expertise required of the Board of Directors' own pool of candidates and interest in the Company's business, and the ability to attend and prepare for Board of Directors, committee and Shareholder meetings. Candidates should represent the interests of all Shareholders and not those of a special interest group. A Shareholder wishing to nominate a candidate should do so in accordance with the guidelines set forth below under the caption ""Proposals of Shareholders for the 2023 Annual Meeting."" The Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee is committed to incorporating diversity in all its forms including diversity of attributes, skills, experiences, backgrounds, and demographics, including race, ethnicity, and gender, all with a view to identify candidates that can assist the Board of Directors with its decision making. The Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee places primary emphasis on (i) judgment, character, expertise, skills and knowledge useful to the oversight of the Company's business; (ii) diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, experiences and other demographics; (iii) business or other relevant experience; and (iv) the extent to which the interplay of the nominee's expertise, skills, knowledge and experience with that of other members of the Board of Directors will build a board that is  Life Storage, Inc. 2022 Proxy Statement - 11 - active, collegial and responsive to the needs of the Company. In addition, the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee recognizes the importance of diversity of race, ethnicity and gender on the Board of Directors consistent with its fiduciary duties. The Board has taken this into consideration in establishing the list of nominees and will continue to do so in the future as part of the normal succession planning process. The Company does not have a mandatory retirement age for directors as the Company believes that the composition of the Board should include not only appropriate experience and expertise, but also take into account the need for differing perspectives. As a result, the composition of the Board has evolved over time. The nominees for the Board, as a whole, reflect this balance. All of the eight nominees have served on the Board for ten years or less, with five of the eight nominees serving on the Board for five years or less. Director Independence The Board of Directors has reviewed all transactions or relationships between each director, director nominee, or any member of his or her immediate family and the Company, its senior management and its independent registered public accounting firm. Based on this review and as required by the independence standards of the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE""), the Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that all directors and directors serving in 2021, other than Messrs. Rogers and Saffire, are independent from management and its independent registered public accounting firm within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards and as defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). There were no transactions, relationships or arrangements with any director or director nominee determined to be independent that were required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 that the Board of Directors considered as part of such review. Board Orientation, Education and Self-Assessment. Each independent director, upon initial election to the Board, undergoes a rigorous orientation wherein such director meets all of the members of senior management, and attends presentations concerning the Company's core disciplines, including marketing, sales, revenue management, acquisition and due diligence procedures, security and controls. In addition to new director orientation, our directors regularly participate in continuing education to maintain the skills necessary to perform their duties and responsibilities and to keep abreast of industry trends, legal and regulatory developments and corporate governance practices. These include participation in NAREIT and other conferences, various presentations by outside advisors and consultants at board meetings and retreats, regular discussions with management and the opportunity to attend various external board education programs and membership in the National Association of Corporate Directors. The Board of Directors performs an evaluation of its performance at least annually to determine whether it is functioning effectively. Each Board committee also performs an annual evaluation of its performance.  Life Storage, Inc. 2022 Proxy Statement - 12 - HOW WE ARE ORGANIZED Board Leadership Structure.  Mark G. Barberio serves as the Company's non-executive Chair of the Board. Mr. Barberio's extensive qualifications include responsibility for strategy, executive management, operations, finance, real estate, investor relations and business development. He has experience as a director, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and as a board committee chair with other large companies. The Company believes that having a Chair of the Board who is not an executive officer of the Company is the appropriate leadership structure for the Company at this time as it allows the Executive Officers of the Company to focus on day-to-day business while allowing the Chair of the Board to lead the Board in its fundamental role of providing advice to and independent oversight of management.

The entire global cruise industry has been devastated by Covid-19 but, ultimately, Genting was sunk by draconian pandemic restrictions[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3162385/coronavirus-what-are-hong-kongs-latest-rules] in its home port of Hong Kong, where it should have been marking the six-month anniversary of its inaugural ""cruises to nowhereï¿½?on January 30. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge[https://www.scmp.com/knowledge], our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. The wider economic impact on the city could be destructive, but some in the industry are trying to hold their nerve. ""It is still early to comment, as we await news of the restructuring ï¿½?it seems from their announcement that Dream Cruises will continue to operate, and indeed they are currently sailing in Singapore,ï¿½?says Jeff Bent, managing director of Worldwide Cruise Terminals, which operates Hong Kongâs Kai Tak Cruise Terminal. Genting confirms it intends to keep parts of the business operating, including some cruises, but it is still not possible to do so from the companyâs home port, with the Hong Kong government having halted all cruises on January 7 due to rising Covid-19 case numbers. Now Gentingâs 150,000-tonne flagship, the Genting Dream, with its 36 food outlets, two spas, 999-seat theatre and two swimming pools, languishes forlornly at anchor in Hong Kongâs outer harbour. Only five years ago, while dining aboard the Genting Dream with the shipâs Swedish captain, Magnus Gottberg, the topic of conversation was the nascent Asian cruising boom. It had been a tradition that Genting employed Scandinavian deck officers ever since the company bought two old Swedish ferries and launched Star Cruises in 1993. Star Cruises tapped into a lucrative market niche that the big players had missed. Cheap and cheerful offshore casino gambling proved popular with Chinese cruisers. By 2015, when China was forecast to be the biggest market for cruise holidays by 2030, Genting was well poised to profit from the regional luxury cruising boom. Dream Cruises was founded and two new vessels ï¿½?Genting Dream (launched in 2016) and World Dream (launched in 2017 and the ship currently operating in Singapore) ï¿½?were designed to deliver the highest level of guest service and opulence in the region. To capitalise on the growing demand for cruise ships, in 2016 Genting also established MV Werften, comprising three existing German shipyards. The move loaded the business with a colossal overhead and a major financial commitment. Big ships take many years to construct and it is rarely possible to change your mind if there is an unexpected downturn in business. And then Covid-19 struck. Global news was dominated by the drama aboard the Diamond Princess[https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3077058/cabin-fever-life-aboard-quarantined-diamond] cruise ship and footage of passengers being stretchered ashore from other luxury liners to waiting ambulances. International cruising collapsed almost overnight. By September 2020, around six months after the shutdown of cruises worldwide, it was estimated the industry had suffered a loss of US$50 billion. Genting runs a tight corporate ship and went to extraordinary measures to rebuild consumer confidence when cruises resumed. On Genting Dream, all crew members had to be fully vaccinated 14 days before boarding; passengers also needed to be fully vaccinated 14 days before their departure date and pass a Covid-19 PCR test 48 hours before sailing. The shipâs design enables external air to be filtered in, and there is no recirculation of air between cabins. Touchless handwashing stations and a PCR test machine with medical-laboratory-level capabilities were installed along with negative-pressure isolation wards in its medical centre. No cases of Covid-19 have been reported on Genting cruises operating from Hong Kong. It was possible Genting might have weathered the storm. On June 3, 2021, it announced MV Werften had received a loan commitment from Germanyâs Economic Stabilisation Fund to keep the shipyards afloat. And even with limited passenger capacity, two- and three-night themed cruises within Hong Kong waters generated much-needed cash. But then the loan fell through and as Genting scrambled desperately for time, the company was sunk in its home port. Twelve days after cruises were banned, Genting filed for bankruptcy. ""The more relevant issue now is when and under what circumstances the government will allow cruising to resume, given that it continues in most of the rest of the world,ï¿½?Bent says."
443,1,Summer action plan: DJB to target 998MGD peak water supply,720 words,Hindustan Times,"""The targeted production from the nine water treatment plants will be pushed up to 861MGD instead of last year's peak summer production of 845 MGD. The extraction of water from sub-surface resources, such as ranney wells and tubewells, will be 137MGD -- an addition of 47 MGD over last year,"" said a senior DJB official. A senior DJB official said that the number of operational tubewells will be raised to 5,263 -- an increase of 471 -- to meet the increased target, adding that the water will be sustainably extracted from areas having high ground water level and located along the Yamuna floodplains or water treatment plants with high natural recharge. The groundwater contribution to Delhi's water supply was 86MGD in 2020 and 90MGD in 2021. Experts have, however, raised questions about the quality of groundwater sources. According to the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB), water in most parts of Delhi is already in the ""overexploited"" category, meaning there is more extraction than there is recharge. Its latest annual report for 2020-21, released in August 2021, claims that large parts of groundwater in Delhi was also found to have high salinity levels and had the presence of heavy metals such as iron, manganese and even uranium beyond the permissible limits. The economic survey released by the Delhi government on March 25, 2022 states that the water treatment capacity of the DJB, which had remained largely stagnant at 906MGD between 2014 to 2018, has witnessed growth over the last three years with the largest spike over the last one year. ""The water production is also being gradually increased by reducing water leakage losses, increasing the performance levels of water treatment plant by replacing filters, old pumps and also shoring up the sub-surface water resources,"" said the official. DJB operates nine water treatment plants in the city at Wazirabad, Chandrawal, Haiderpur, Nangloi, Okhla, Dwarka, Bawana, Bhagirathi and Sonia Vihar. ""The optimisation has led to increase of production by 5MGD each in Chandrawal and Haiderpur water treatment plants while the other units will increase output by 1-2 MGD,"" said the official. The latest outcome budget of the DJB states that the water utility has been able to save 4MGD of water due to repair of 2,955km of old and defective pipelines till December 2021. While the piped water supply has been extended to 1,642 unauthorised colonies, the water utility has also identified 10,141 daily fixed water supply points where tankers will be deployed. ""Between April and July 2022 period, 1,198 water tanker will remain on duty. DJB has 250 stainless steel water tankers, 407 units have been contracted and another 541 have been hired for summer action plan... The vulnerable points have been identified in consultation with the local MLAs,"" the official explained. Manoj Misra, who heads Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, said that such water extraction points can be developed in the active floodplain areas where natural recharge can occur but the water utility should not extend it to the non-floodplain zones. ""The concern mainly is regarding the quality of water and there should be constant monitoring of the contaminants in the water being extracted. In Sonia Vihar or Palla floodplains, chances of contamination are low but the DJB should still monitor the level of insecticide contamination due to agricultural activities on floodplains,"" he added.

334,1,National Grid cashes in as electricity prices surge,333 words,Daily Mail,"The announcement comes as inflation reached a 30-year-high of 7pc, with growing energy prices playing a big role in the increase. Power prices in the UK have surged in the past year, driven by an increase in the cost of natural gas. Oil and gas prices have jumped 37pc and 90pc respectively since the start of the year, leading to a Â£693 rise in the energy price cap in April. The cap is expected to rise again in October if global power prices remain elevated. There have been calls for the company to use its increased profits to reduce bills for households. Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said: 'Households up and down the country will look on in horror at the spectre of a private firm profiteering from the misery of increasing fuel prices. 'This is obscene, and we would urge the directors of National Grid to spend the Easter weekend talking to people who are struggling to make ends meet and look at how they may use their profits for good. The announcement just goes to show why so many people across the political spectrum are now calling for windfall taxes.'  National Grid makes its money by charging suppliers to use its network to provide electricity to households, a cost that is then passed on to consumers through a transmission charge added to their bills.  Wera Hobhouse MP, the Liberal Democrat spokesman for energy, said: 'People can't afford to heat and power their homes right now yet they are watching major suppliers rake in billions. The call for windfall taxes on energy suppliers is deafening yet the Government is burying their heads in the sand.'"

753,1,"Technology, BFSI firms account for 51 pc of office leasing in January-March: report",542 words,Press Trust of India,"""Technology corporates drove leasing with a share of about 34 per cent, followed by BFSI firms (17 per cent), flexible space operators (13 per cent), engineering & manufacturing (12 per cent) and research, consulting & analytics firms (11 per cent),"" CBRE said. Bengaluru, Chennai and Delhi-NCR dominated absorption during the quarter, accounting for almost two-thirds of the transaction activity. ""With the government's evolving COVID-19 protocols and the recovery in office leasing in 2021, we expect the positive momentum to further strengthen in 2022,"" said Anshuman Magazine, Chairman & CEO - India, South-East Asia, Middle East & Africa. ""We continue to witness a pick up in long-term decision-making by occupiers, aided by return-to-work strategies, thereby accelerating project completions,"" he added. Ram Chandnani, Managing Director, Advisory & Transactions Services, CBRE India, expected that the increase in leasing activity would bring a new focus on large-sized and high-quality buildings by developers to differentiate their assets and attract occupiers. On new trends, CBRE said that renewals, renegotiations and addition of flexibility options are likely to be the focus of occupiers in the short term. ""We expect to see clearer evidence emerging in any corporates' intended shift towards hybrid working policies, with several occupiers planning to implement policies allowing office-based working with the option of working remotely,"" the report said. With an increased focus on wellness, user experience and sustainability, occupiers are expected to demand more sophisticated and tech-enhanced real estate offerings. Environmental and sustainability issues such as carbon emissions, use of sustainable materials, energy efficiency and wellness enhancements are likely to become ever more important to occupiers and owners of office buildings, the consultant said. As per the data, the office leasing in Delhi-NCR grew by 87 per cent to 1.9 million square feet during the January-March period of 2022. Mumbai saw a leasing of 0.8 million square feet, up 70 per cent from the year-ago period. Office leasing in Bengaluru rose 43 per cent to 3.5 million square feet, while Chennai saw a multi-fold rise in absorption to 2.3 million square feet. Hyderabad witnessed 75 per per rise in leasing of office space to 1.4 million square feet. Pune saw a sharp rise in leasing to 1.1 million square feet. Office leasing in Kolkata grew 84 per cent to 0.2 million square feet. Ahmedabad saw 170 per cent growth year-on-year in office leasing at 0.2 million square feet in the January-March quarter.

121,0,"Groom is forced to have tattoo showing the time and date of his wedding changed after Â£4,000 dream venue closes to become hotel to house asylum seekers",940 words,Mail Online,"* He paid Â£180 to have the date and time of his wedding tattooed for the big day A groom-to-be has been forced to change a tattoo with the time and date of his wedding after his dream venue cancelled his big day because it became a hotel to house asylum seekers. Michael Crane, 37, and his fiancÃ©e Linda Brown, 42, from Warrington, Cheshire, were looking forward to their wedding day on 5th August this year, so much so that Michael got the time and date with 'Always and forever' above it tattooed on the back of his hand. But on Monday, they were left with the news that Best Western Park Hall Hotel in Lancashire they paid Â£4,000 to book was closing as a wedding venue for it to reopen as a hotel for asylum seekers. They were among thousands of couples who were left without a venue for their weddings. On the day of the announcement, police were called to take care of furious engaged couples demanding their money back. Michael, who paid Â£180 to have the date and time of his wedding, as well as a clock showing the time when they would say 'I do,' tattooed on his left hand before Christmas, said he was shocked and angry when he found out. They have been able to rearrange their wedding for the next day at a different location, so he will get the five on his tattoo adjusted to six, but the time will be wrong. 'It's shocking really. Never in a million years did we think they would shut down,' he said. 'It's a beautiful room, they have an old medieval hall and when it's done up it looks smashing. The room sealed it for us. 'But since we booked it, the hotel has shut down twice. It's been a nightmare ever from the beginning. 'They blamed the lockdown but the government guidelines didn't say they had to shut at the time. 'You don't expect that from a hotel attached to a name like Best Western.' The couple, who have been together four years, forked out Â£4,000 up front for the wedding which was due to be held on August 5th. Michael said he had family coming from America who had booked to stay at the hotel too and he now fears they won't get any of that back. He added: 'I've got a lot of tattoos, but since getting my Covid jab they don't heal very well so I wanted it to heal in time for the wedding. 'We booked it October. I only found out on the weekend when I saw a Google review that somebody said they'd enjoyed the stay but the hotel was closing on February 7th. We weren't even told.' Adam Weate, 32, and Danielle Sugden, 29, had been also due to tie the knot at Park Hall on May 7th. News of the closure started to arise on social media on Sunday night. The groom-to-be dashed to Park Hall on Sunday night to be told that if he returned at 11am the next day there would be someone on hand to offer explanations and a refund. But when they arrived at the allotted hour they say they were faced with a scene of chaos and they weren't able to speak to anyone in authority. They were only given Â£1,000 out of the Â£2,500 they had paid out and were left with more questions than answers. Former Wigan Athletic chairman Bill Kenyon, who owns nearby Holland Hall, has offered both couples the use of his venue for the same price they paid Park Hall. Adam said: 'It has been a total rollercoaster. 'Our wedding had been cancelled twice at Park Hall already. It was due to Covid, there was nothing they could do about that, but they didn't handle it with any sort of empathy. 'Then on Sunday night we saw on social media that the place was going to close. 'I dashed there late at night and the told me to come back 12 hours later and all would be sorted - but it wasn't. 'We got Â£1,000 of the promised refund but no explanations, including the rest of the money and all the guests who were booked in.' Mr Kenyon said: 'There can't be many things worse than seeing lots of finely-tuned wedding plans going wrong. 'We hope we can at least help some of the couples affected.' Jenni Halliday, Serco's contract director for asylum accommodation services, said: 'With the significant increases in the number of people arriving in the UK we have been faced with no alternative but to temporarily accommodate some asylum seekers in hotels. 'These hotels are only used as a last resort but as a provider of accommodation services on behalf of the Home Office we have a responsibility to find accommodation for the asylum seekers that are being placed in our care. 'The Serco team is working extremely hard to move people into dispersed social housing as rapidly as possible.' Bes Western has been approached for comment."
183,1,Global Commodities Roundup: Market Talk,781 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1858 GMT - The US government and investors shouldn't jump to the conclusion that Europe's current, war-driven gas shortage represents an expansion opportunity for the US liquefied-natural-gas industry, says Robert Rozansky at Global Energy Monitor, a nonprofit research organization. New LNG export terminals, Rozansky says, typically take three to five years to be built and will likely find a different market when they come online. ""They will be competing with new and cheaper sources of gas from suppliers such as Qatar, and new and cheaper renewables now being fast-tracked in the European Union,"" he adds. ""New [LNG] projects are not a viable solution to Europe's near-term gas needs."" (luis.garcia@wsj.com) 1703 GMT - The rate of soybeans crushed in March rose slightly from the same time last year, according to this month's report from the National Oilseed Processors Association. According to NOPA, soybeans were crushed at a rate of 181.8M bushels in March versus 178M bushels a year earlier. This month's rate is a little lower than what grain traders expected, Terry Reilly of Futures International says in a note. However, Reilly also notes soybean oil stocks fell more than expected, to 1.9B pounds. Soybean futures on the CBOT ended trading yesterday up 0.4% and the exchange is closed today in observance of Good Friday.

In its latest outlook, DTN forecasts in its 6-10 day outlook for the Midwest that scattered showers are expected in the early part of next week, followed by dryness in the latter half of the week. In the East, temperatures are also expected to be above normal for this time of year, the firm also says. With spring planting just beginning in much of the US, grain traders are putting a lot of their focus on weather forecasts for the upcoming weeks.

Additionally, 177,000 tons were sold to unknown destinations for delivery in 2021/22. Today's announcement comes after yesterday's flash sale of 132,000 tons of soybeans to China in 2021/22--and points to increasing momentum for US soybean exports. ""Outstanding sales are continuing to run above the five-year average, and this could point to better late season exports,"" says AgriSompo in a note.

80,0,Burger King: Russian operator 'refused' to close hundreds of restaurants,780 words,The Washington Post,"In a letter to employees, RBI President International David Shear said the company demanded the shutdown of all Burger King operations in Russia but that Kolobov ""refused."" It has proved difficult to withdraw from the complicated web of business agreements established 10 years ago, he added. ""Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today? No,"" Shear wrote. ""But we want to be transparent with our actions and explain the steps we have taken to stand with the international business community in response to Russia's attack on Ukraine and its people,"" he said.  Burger King's experience illustrates the difficulty many corporations face when trying to extricate themselves from decades-old investments. Western corporations are under tremendous public pressure to leave Russia amid the humanitarian crisis enveloping Ukraine. Russia has become an economic pariah after the United States and its allies hit Moscow with a slew of sanctions. Russian financial markets have been shuttered for nearly three weeks, and at least 400 foreign corporations have exited the country. Some of Russia's government bonds - just last month widely traded global assets - are selling for cents on the dollar. But many corporations have found themselves bound to Russia by legal agreements, client relationships and other complicated entanglements. And those that do cease operations face the prospect that their local assets will be nationalized and restarted under Russian ownership, in some cases under trademarks that closely resemble Western brands. Businesses that operate through franchising models have had particular trouble leaving the country. Their ability to cut ties with Russia has been dependent on how many of their branded stores they actually own. ""When master franchise agreements and joint ventures are formed, there are extensive commitments to long-term investments and accountabilities to grow the business together. There are no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement,"" Shear wrote. ""Any current attempt to enforce our contract would ultimately require the support of Russian authorities on the ground and we know that will not practically happen anytime soon,"" he added. ""This is also why you may see other brands in Russia with similar structures continue to operate in the market."" The 450 Subway stores in Russia, for example, are locally operated and managed by a master franchisee. ""We don't directly control these independent franchisees and their restaurants, and have limited insight into their day-to-day operations,"" the company wrote in a statement Wednesday.  McDonald's, meanwhile, has pursued a global business model in which it directly owns more of the stores that carry its brand. It owns 84 percent of its roughly 850 Russian locations, allowing it to order the bulk of them to shut down, although it promised to continue paying employees. In his letter to employees, Shear said his team has been working around-the-clock to ""do all the right things."" RBI has suspended all new investments there, and is redirecting any Russian profits to the United Nations' refugee agency, he said. It's possible that Russian operators could continue operating Western-branded stores even when the foreign franchiser tells them to cease and desist. Russia's government and legal system does not recognize Western sanctions as legitimate, and is unlikely to enforce a foreign company's claim to its own brand. Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to nationalize businesses that try to pull out of the country. Various knockoff brands are already appearing in Russian trademark filings, says D.C.-based trademark lawyer Josh Gerben. ""Russian trademark squatters are out in full force,"" Gerben tweeted Friday. He referenced Russian trademark filings for ""IDEA FURNITURE FACTORY,"" featuring a logo similar to Ikea's, alongside apparent Instagram imitators RUSTAGRAM and INSTARUS. Another Russian business, called Uncle Vanya's, trademarked a logo resembling the famed McDonald's Golden Arches, inverted on its side against a familiar red background."

Ocado boss Melanie Smith said the grocer's ""thoughts today, and every day"" were with the Ukrainian people amid conflict with Russia. She added: ""The last quarter has been encouraging for Ocado retail despite the clearly evident challenges the industry and consumers are facing.

The grocer forecast that revenue growth would hit ""the high-teens"" by the end of its financial year. However, for the year as a whole, the grocer anticipated revenue growth closer to 10 per cent, due to various macroeconomic challenges and changing consumer behaviour."

612,1,Top News Today: Bank Earnings Stoke Uncertainty; Stocks Fall; Musk Offers to Buy Twitter,3073 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"TREASURYS: Ten- and 30-year Treasury yields rose to their highest levels since 2018 and 2019, respectively, after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams reinforced the likelihood that the central bank will deliver a larger-than-normal, half-percentage point interest rate hike in May. FOREX: The U.S. dollar rose against a basket of rival currencies, as traders positioned themselves for aggressive Fed rate policy and more turmoil in global markets. COMMODITIES: Oil futures rose after a report said European Union officials were drafting a measure to ban Russian oil. Thursday's gain contributed to a nearly 9% climb in crude prices for the holiday-shortened week. HEADLINES  Elon Musk Offers to Buy Rest of Twitter at a Valuation of More Than $43 Billion  Elon Musk offered to buy the rest of Twitter Inc. in a deal valuing the social-media platform at more than $43 billion, saying he wants to take the company private to make it the online home for free speech. Mr. Musk called the bid his ""best and final offer,"" adding that if his proposal isn't accepted ""I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder."" Mr. Musk earlier this year built a position of more than 9% in Twitter.  Twitter confirmed it had received Mr. Musk's offer and said its board of directors would review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company and all its shareholders. Twitter shares traded lower for parts of Thursday, indicating that investors were pessimistic about the deal's prospects. The bid adds to a whirlwind 10 days for Twitter and increases the stakes for the company and Chief Executive Parag Agrawal. Wall Street's Deal-Making Boom Starts to Sputter Out Wall Street was expected to return to normal in 2022 after the pandemic sent it on a wild ride two years ago. It didn't. Major U.S. banks reported double-digit drops in first-quarter profit this week, from an 11% decline at Morgan Stanley to a 46% drop at Citigroup Inc. Those banks, along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co., all reported lower revenue as well. The highest inflation in decades and the war in Ukraine raised concerns in the first quarter about a possible recession. Commodity prices surged as the war triggered fears of energy and food shortages. Bonds and stocks both sold off, an unusual tandem move that reflected investors' worries. Corporate chiefs, who had fueled Wall Street's two-year dealmaking boom, stayed on the sidelines.  Wells Fargo Quarterly Profit Falls 21%  Wells Fargo & Co.'s profit declined 21% in the first quarter, despite increased lending and a release of more than $1 billion in funds the bank had set aside for potential losses. The San Francisco-based bank said Thursday that it made $3.67 billion in the first quarter, down from $4.64 billion a year ago. Per-share earnings totaled 88 cents, above the 81 cents expected from analysts polled by FactSet. The bank posted revenue of $17.59 billion, down 5% from $18.53 billion a year ago. That came in just below expectations of $17.78 billion. Peloton to Cut Price of Bikes, Raise Subscription Fees  Peloton Interactive Inc. will cut prices of its stationary bikes and treadmills and raise monthly subscriptions for online workout classes. The changes are part of an effort by Peloton's new CEO to create a company more focused on its digital business and less reliant on sales of connected exercise equipment. Starting June 1, Peloton equipment owners will pay $44 a month, up from $39, for access to metrics and subscriptions to live-streaming and on-demand classes that connect with their bikes and treadmills. The $12.99 monthly fee to access courses that aren't connected to equipment won't change.  UnitedHealth Posts Higher Quarterly Revenue, Raises Earnings Guidance  UnitedHealth Group Inc. posted higher revenue and profit for the first three months of 2022 and raised its full-year earnings outlook, as costs tied to Covid-19 dropped off and no signs emerged of major long-term health impacts due to care deferred during the pandemic. The healthcare and health-insurance giant, the first industry heavyweight to report first-quarter results, posted double-digit revenue growth at both its Optum and UnitedHealthcare units, as the Omicron variant-driven surge in Covid-19 cases at the start of the quarter faded. The company, based in Minnetonka, Minn., on Thursday also raised its full-year earnings guidance, powered in part by growth in the Optum health-services arm. Fed's John Williams Says Half-Point Rate Rise Is Reasonable Option for May  Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said a large interest-rate increase is a good prospect at the central bank's early May meeting, as part of an effort to move short-term rates up aggressively to contend with high inflation. A half-percentage-point increase at the May 3-4 rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting is ""a very reasonable option,"" Mr. Williams said Thursday on Bloomberg Television. While noting no decision has been made yet, Mr. Williams said the central bank's short-term interest-rate target range is ""very low"" in an environment of high inflation. ""From a monetary policy point of view, it does make sense for us to move expeditiously towards more normal levels of the federal-funds rate, and also did move forward on our balance-sheet reduction plans,"" said Mr. Williams, who is also vice chairman of the FOMC. High Gasoline Prices Take Up Big Share of March Retail Spending Increase U.S. retail sales rose in March for the third straight month as consumers confronted the highest inflation in four decades and absorbed record-high gasoline prices. Retail and restaurant spending rose by 0.5% in March compared with the previous month, the Commerce Department said Thursday, down from the revised monthly increase of 0.8% in February. Gasoline sales jumped 8.9% in March over the previous month after Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered higher oil and gasoline prices. Excluding gasoline sales, retail sales fell by 0.3%. Unemployment Claims Rose Slightly Last Week New applications for U.S. unemployment benefits rose last week, but remained near historically low levels as employers held on to workers in a tight labor market. Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, rose to 185,000 during the week that ended on April 9, compared with a revised 167,000 the week prior, the Labor Department said Thursday. New claims had fallen to the lowest point since 1968 in early April. The four-week moving average, which smooths out volatility, rose to 172,250.  Pfizer Says Covid-19 Booster in Children Ages 5 to 11 Sparked Immune Response Against Omicron A booster dose of the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE generated a strong immune response in children 5 to 11 years old, an encouraging sign for youngsters to maintain protection against the virus. The companies said Thursday that a late-stage study of a booster found the extra shot significantly increased antibody levels against the Omicron variant. The shot also raised antibody supply against the initial strain the vaccines were designed to fight. The booster shot was found to be safe and well-tolerated among the children in the study, the companies said. The results haven't been peer-reviewed by independent experts or published in a medical journal. Separate studies have found that adults who receive a third dose of mRNA vaccines are less likely to become infected, or to develop severe disease, than those who got two doses.  Amazon CEO Andy Jassy Pledges to Improve Worker Safety in Shareholder Letter  Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Andy Jassy, in his first shareholder letter as leader of the e-commerce giant, said he wants to improve worker safety and build on the innovations that have made Amazon one of the world's leading tech companies. Mr. Jassy, who took over as CEO from founder Jeff Bezos last summer, used his first yearly address released Thursday to write about Amazon's progress on new products and services, the company's growth in the Covid-19 pandemic and new efforts to improve safety. ""We spent Amazon's first 25 years building a very large fulfillment network, and then had to double it in the last 24 months to meet customer demand,"" Mr. Jassy said. He also noted the challenges of the labor shortage and supply-chain issues that led to higher costs.  Morgan Stanley's Profit Falls 11% as Deals Slow  Morgan Stanley's profit fell 11% from a year ago, reflecting a decline in corporate deal making and a treacherous stretch for markets. The bank posted a profit of $3.7 billion, or $2.04 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet expected $1.71 a share. Revenue fell 6% to $14.8 billion in the quarter, surpassing expectations of $14.25 billion. Fees from brokering mergers and fundraisings fell 37%, as corporate chiefs hung back from volatile markets. At JPMorgan Chase & Co., which reported first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, investment-banking revenue was 31% lower.  Citigroup's First-Quarter Earnings Fell 46%  Citigroup Inc.'s first-quarter profit fell 46%, dragged down by higher expenses and potential losses from its exposure to Russia. Profit fell to $4.31 billion, or $2.02 per share, compared with analysts' forecast for $1.43 per share. A year ago, Citigroup posted a profit of $7.94 billion, or $3.62 per share. Revenue fell 2% to $19.19 billion but topped Wall Street's expectations for $18.19 billion, according to FactSet. TALKING POINTS Russia Warns It Could Station Nuclear Forces in Europe if Finland, Sweden Join NATO By Bojan Pancevski and Georgi Kantchev Russia warned on Thursday that it could station nuclear forces in and around a Russian exclave in Northern Europe and bolster its military presence there if Finland and Sweden join the NATO alliance. 14 Apr 2022 16:52 ET Top News Today: Bank Earnings Stoke Uncertainty; -2- Finland and Sweden are considering joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and will make a decision in the coming weeks. Both countries have a long tradition of military neutrality, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine has tilted public opinion and the political consensus in both countries toward seeking membership in the U.S.-led alliance.  Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said Thursday that Russia would have to bolster its defenses in Kaliningrad-a Russian exclave wedged between Lithuania and Poland-as well as in the Baltic Sea, if the two countries joined the alliance. ""In this case, it will no longer be possible to talk about any nonnuclear status of the Baltic-the balance must be restored,"" said Mr. Medvedev, who served as Russia's president from 2008 to 2012. ""Until now, Russia has not taken such measures and was not going to take them."" Mr. Medvedev said Russia would need to enhance its ground forces and air defenses in the region and deploy significant naval forces in the waters of the Baltic Sea. Mr. Medvedev's comments were echoed by the Kremlin on Thursday. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russian President Vladimir Putin had already instructed the Defense Ministry to submit proposals for strengthening Russia's ""western flank against the backdrop of building up the potential of NATO near our western borders."" Mr. Peskov said that there was no timeline yet for when such plans would be presented. Read Full Article on NewsPlus Mortgage Rates Hit 5% for First Time Since 2011 By Matt Grossman The interest rate on America's most popular mortgage hit 5% for the first time in more than a decade, extending a sharp rise that has yet to significantly slow the red-hot housing market. Interest on the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage climbed from 4.72% a week ago to its highest level since early 2011, government-mortgage company Freddie Mac said Thursday. Fifteen months ago, mortgage rates were at all-time lows. Rates' fastest three-month increase since 1987 has made the housing market ground zero for the Federal Reserve's efforts to tame inflation. Home buyers, already facing surging house prices, are now contending with a substantial increase in financing expenses, further lifting monthly payments. A year ago, buying the median American home at prevailing rates meant a monthly mortgage bill of about $1,223 after a 20% down payment, according to calculations by George Ratiu, an economist at Realtor.com. At recent rates, such a purchase would require a monthly payment of nearly $1,700-a 38% increase, he estimated.  News Corp, parent of The Wall Street Journal, operates Realtor.com. Even compared with searing inflation elsewhere in the economy, that counts as extraordinary price growth. It also strikes at the bedrock of many families' finances, Mr. Ratiu said. ""Most Americans who buy a home are in a sense making the biggest purchase of their lives,"" he said. Some hopeful homeowners are paying more up front to sidestep higher rates. The home Sam Skinner is having built in Delaware is set to be completed in the middle of the summer. In late February, he decided to pay about $6,000 to lock in a rate of 3.875% with Wells Fargo to avoid being stuck with what he believed would be a notably higher interest rate in July or August. ""I'm a very risk averse person, so no way was I going to sit here stressing about rates while the house is being built, not knowing how much our payments would be,"" Mr. Skinner said. Though rising rates have made buying more expensive, the housing market has remained tight. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index rose 19.2% in the year that ended in January. Interest rates are rising elsewhere in the economy too, lifted by the Fed's plans to raise benchmark overnight-lending costs and draw down its support for bond markets. In doing so, the Fed aims to bring demand into balance with supply, chilling upward pressure on prices. The central bank is responding to inflation that has now reached its highest pace in four decades. The government said Tuesday that March's consumer-price index rose 8.5% year over year, as costs soared for energy, food and airfare. With unemployment nearly back to prepandemic levels and close to all-time lows, Fed officials have called fighting inflation their priority. Read Full Article on NewsPlus WEALTH MANAGEMENT Should Your IRA Include Real-Estate Investments? Given the turmoil in the markets, I'm worried about my IRA. I'm looking for investments other than stocks and bonds that might work for me. What are your thoughts about buying and holding real estate inside an IRA? In short, real estate and IRAs typically don't mix well. I'm hearing more questions along these lines. Yes, markets are unsettled, to say the least (the S&P 500 index has been down as much as 13.67% since the start of 2022), and many economists are anticipating tepid returns for the foreseeable future. As such, retirees are asking whether alternative investments, including real estate, might help shore up their nest eggs. Alternative investments certainly can help diversify a portfolio. But to your specific question: Using IRA funds to invest in real estate tends to be problematic. To start, you can't use money inside your IRA to buy property for personal use, such as a primary residence or vacation home. The Internal Revenue Service labels this as a ""prohibited transaction."" Translation: The government wants you to use your IRA and its tax advantages to generate retirement savings-not to buy a place at the beach for you and your family. --Glenn Ruffenach Expected Major Events for Friday 04:30/JPN: Feb Revised Retail Sales 06:45/FRA: Mar CPI 08:00/ITA: Mar CPI 12:30/US: Apr Empire State Manufacturing Survey 13:15/US: Mar Industrial Production & Capacity Utilization 14:00/US: Mar State Employment and Unemployment 20:00/US: Feb Treasury International Capital Data Expected Major Events for Monday 14:00/US: Apr NAHB Housing Market Index All times in GMT.

In an interview with an RT anchor, Lionel ï¿½?who, like Madonna, goes by one name ï¿½?suggested that the collective denunciation of Russiaâs actions in Ukraine was as unhinged as demanding to speak to the manager about some minor customer-service flap: âWe are being conditioned to overreact to everything ï¿½?and this Ukraine situation is no different,ï¿½?he said. Honestly, it was kind of sad. One does not expect much sophistication from Russia Today, the Russian government-funded television and internet outlet that has long been a haven for conspiracy theories and populist, anti-Western propaganda. Yet I was not prepared for the ineffectual clownishness of some of the arguments that RT has lately floated in defense of the invasion.

In the Ukraine invasion, though, we are seeing that Russian influence has significant limits ï¿½?and perhaps the unraveling of the myth of Putinâs mastery over global discourse.

Perhaps the most obvious is that the invasion is just too ugly a pig to pretty up ï¿½?an act so baldly unjustified that no amount of propaganda could set it right. But weâre seeing something else, too: that our fear of Russian domination over digital discourse may have always been a little overblown. In a 2016 paper, Christopher Paul and Miriam Matthews, both at RAND, described Russiaâs model of digital propaganda as a âfire hose of falsehoods.â[https://www-rand-org.proxy.library.nyu.edu/pubs/perspectives/PE198.html] The operation, which Russia has been developing since at least its 2008 incursion into Georgia, is âhigh-volume and multichannelï¿½?ï¿½?propagandistic memes, videos, social media posts and other content is produced in huge quantities and distributed across all forms of media. This great gusher of propaganda is characterized by a kind of chaos; because Russiaâs messaging is produced in such high volume and because it often lacks any commitment to consistency or fidelity to objective reality, it seems aimed at confusing and overwhelming an audience just as easily as it persuades. This might be the modelâs great limit. Like, alas, a lot of media now, Russiaâs fire hose can amplify conspiracy theories bubbling online and sow chaos and confusion in pockets of society ï¿½?all of which can certainly be helpful to an aggressive, authoritarian state. But how helpful? Itâs very hard to say; the effectiveness of Russiaâs internet chicanery has always been murky.

And with the world now clued in to Russiaâs playbook, that race may have been the high-water mark for Putinâs digital meddling.

36,0,Ticketless fans may struggle for hotels during Qatar World Cup,494 words,Al Jazeera English,"The Qatar 2022 World Cup organisers have launched an official accommodation portal for the tournament with ticket-holders as priority, meaning visitors arriving in Qatar without match tickets may not be able to secure a place to stay. Qatar is hoping to attract more than one million visitors during the World Cup that takes place from November 21 to December 18 this year. In the first round of ticket sales earlier this year, FIFA, footballâs world governing body, said it had received 17 million applications, the results of which were announced through a lucky draw. âFans can book accommodation via the dedicated portal which will offer various options such as apartments, villas and cruise ships,ï¿½?Omar al-Jaber, Executive Director of Accommodation at the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC), the tournament host organisers, said at the launch of the portal on Wednesday, confirming that prices would start from $80. âThe two cruise ships will have more than 4,000 rooms. There will be fan villages at four different locations. Accommodation options will also be available through vacation homes and visitors have the option of staying with friends and family.ï¿½?An SC official confirmed to Al Jazeera that organisers had block-booked 80 percent of the hotels and accommodation options across the country which will be available to ticket holders.

The organisers, in a statement sent to Al Jazeera earlier this year, said that âwith up to 130,000 rooms for the one million-plus fans expected over the course of the 28-day tournament, there are no concerns over a shortfall of accommodationï¿½? However, al-Jaber was unable to answer Al Jazeeraâs question on whether the SC was confident there would be enough accommodation for all those arriving in Qatar, instead pointing fans with valid tickets to visit the portal at the earliest to get the best prices and availability. An SC official later confirmed to Al Jazeera that âthe priority right now [for accommodation requests] are the ticket holdersï¿½? âWe anticipate a number of visiting fans will stay with friends or family during the tournament. Qatarâs compact tournament footprint will also mean teams and fans need only one accommodation for the duration of the tournament,ï¿½?according to the SC statement.

358,0,The new London hotel with two secret 'laboratory' rooms,840 words,The Telegraph Online,"Eco-credentials A new London hotel might provide answers. Room2 claims to be the worldâs first âwhole life, carbon zero hometelï¿½? More on âhometelsï¿½?later. Letâs deal with the other jargon first: the moment I read the words âwhole life, carbon zeroï¿½? it triggered my rubbish radar. What, I ask Room2âs sustainability officer Melisa Gooding, does it actually mean? âIt looks at the whole life cycle of a building,ï¿½?she explains. âItâs the carbon produced from the raw materials and construction, while the hotel is in use and during any refurbishment, right through to the end of its life.ï¿½?At Room2, apparently, these emissions have been reduced as far as possible, the rest offset through reputable programmes. Touring the hotel, I try to pick holes in this. Itâs not perfect (offsetting is controversial) but it is impressive. Ground source heat pumps harness the temperature of the earth to heat and cool the building. A green roof (home to 75,000 bees) boosts biodiversity and insulation. Solar panels generate electricity, and the rest is from green suppliers using 100 per cent renewable sources. The kids pore over an iPad on a wall in the lobby, exploring and explaining these space-age solutions. Cooler still, the manager tells us that two of the hotel rooms are laboratories, monitoring energy, water and air quality as guests make use of them. A leading university is being lined up to study the data. We are desperate to know if we are staying in one, but no dice. Their location is top secret; not even she knows. âThis is so James Bond,ï¿½?whispers a child. But hereâs the crucial thing: you never feel like you are part of an experiment. Mundane but important measures (motion-responsive lighting and heating, technology tucked inside shower heads to create powerful jets with 40 per cent less water) are invisible. The only sign that you are in eco heaven is a custom-designed bin allowing you to separate out your food waste (which is whisked away and turned into renewable energy, rather than going to landfill). Playful interiors and a gem of a restaurant Otherwise, every corner of our suite is gorgeous. The colours are playful, the design modern, the textures indulgent. Furniture and textiles are bespoke, commissioned from local designers and craftspeople within a 10-mile radius. The (refillable) vegan toiletries are richly scented. Nothing po-faced or puritanical. Even the lifts have bright, marbled wallpaper and Dali-esque melting mirrors. Carpets in corridors are made from recycled fishing nets. There is just one thing I dislike. The name. Room2 summons visions of hostels and shared shower blocks. Itâs a shame, because while the hotel is reasonably priced for London (from Â£129 a night) everything feels luxurious, from the small gym equipped with Peloton bikes to the 2pm check-out time and a genuine gem of a restaurant. Boca is headed up by Elisabetta Boi, who trained on the 31st floor of Aqua Shard. On brand, she sources her burrata from Shoreditch, her salami from Islington. The artistry, though, is all her own. She will tweak the menu to childrenâs tastes. Starters (burrata, fennel pollen, blood orange and lemon oil, say, or red prawn crudo, clementine, pangrattato and black olives), are alone worth a long journey. By train, obviously. There is no hotel parking (bringing your dirty diesel would miss the point). Location, location, location Though Room2 is in leafy Chiswick, Turnham Green station is a three-minute walk away, from where the District or Piccadilly Line can take you into central London in 20 minutes. Itâs a great spot for families and dogs, as the hotel abuts Chiswick Common ï¿½?where children and pets can scamper ï¿½?and all rooms have their own galley kitchen so you can cook (hence âhometelï¿½?. However, we had to book two rooms, with one adult and child in each. Chiswick High Road is 30 seconds away. Such is the appeal of this chic-chi stretch of boutiques and restaurants, Soho House planted an outpost here in 2007. But Iâd pick Room2 over High Road House any day. The food, dÃ©cor and feel are more zeitgeisty. More magical, even. How to do it Snug rooms from Â£129 (020 3988 0220; room2.com[https://room2.com/chiswick/])."

We closed 2021 with a very strong fourth quarter, delivering our highest AFFO per share ever, and finished the full year with AFFO per share up by 12% while delivering total acquisition volume of $1.5 billion at an average cap rate of 7.5% and maintaining our healthy investment spread at over 4%. During the year, the net-lease space became increasingly competitive, primarily due to attractive financing costs for public and private market participants, which has led to some cap rate compression, but our customer-centric business model, unique platform and focus on granular investments continues to differentiate us. Over the past couple of years, we have sought to build a senior leadership team that is exceptionally skilled, highly adaptable to change and eager to take STORE to its next level of growth and value creation. In addition to several internal promotions, in November, Sherry Rexroad, formerly Managing Director, Business Development at BlackRock Global Real Assets Securities, was appointed to Chief Financial Officer, bringing extensive leadership experience in REITS, real estate, finance and capital markets. At the Board level, in December, we announced that Tawn Kelley, a senior corporate executive at Taylor Morrison Home Corporation, would become our new independent, non-executive Chairman of the Board, and in February 2022, we announced the addition of two new independent board members with exceptional backgrounds and skills that complement, and increase the diversity of, our Board.  STORE has reached an important inflection point. We now have the ability to scale our best-in-class platform while continuing to generate strong risk-adjusted returns. To drive this scale, we are increasing our investment in our technology platform and analytic capabilities to enable us to more efficiently identify qualified investments and streamline our decision making process. With our direct origination approach to the large target market we serve and our ability to tailor lease terms based on current economic environments, we are confident that we can continue to generate strong returns in almost any market. At STORE, we define success by our ability to make a positive difference for all our stakeholders. Our environmental initiatives and partnerships focus on assisting our customers with energy savings and carbon footprint reduction in their facilities. In addition, we are proud to have been named to the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the second consecutive year, and we actively nurture a culture that is rooted in diversity, inclusion and development at all levels of our organization and that fully optimizes the career potential of all our employees. As I look to the future for STORE, I see that our market potential is enormous, our customized finance solutions are value creators and our customer relationships have never been stronger. Most importantly, we will not be standing in place. A vital lesson that was re-enforced while successfully navigating the pandemic is adaptability + foundational strength = sustainable growth. I am confident that we have a very bright future ahead. I want to thank all my colleagues for their hard work and dedication, our customers for the trust you have placed in us, our Board of Directors for their wise guidance and our many investors for your support.

Our beginning was inspired by a belief that we could make a positive difference for real estate intensive businesses across America by delivering innovative and superior real estate capital solutions. In that process, we have sought to add an important tool to middle-market company capital formation, while improving the liquidity of leading middle-market and larger businesses. For its many customers, STORE's real estate lease solutions have contributed to their prospects for wealth creation and to their ability to grow, create jobs and contribute to many communities across the country. In turn, meeting the needs of our customers provides an extraordinary investment opportunity that we believe holds the promise of sustainable long-term wealth creation for our many stockholders. In fulfilling this mission, we have grown our staff to more than 120 employees, expanded our diverse and experienced management team and strengthened our commitment to employee development, employee engagement and personal growth, which are central to the creation of a quality business. Customers, stockholders and employees: These are our three most integral stakeholders. Through them, we make a positive difference to our many other important stakeholders, including our creditors, suppliers and the many communities we serve. Environmental Stewardship  STORE is a net-lease real estate investment trust (""REIT""). We acquire single-tenant operational real estate (or profit center properties) from business owners, and then lease the properties back to the business owners under long-term net-leases, substantially all of which are triple-net. Under a triple-net lease, the tenant is solely responsible for operating the business conducted in the building subject to the lease, including keeping the building in good order and repair, remodeling and updating the building as it deems appropriate to maximize business value and paying the insurance, property taxes and other property-related expenses. Under the triple-net lease model, therefore, it is our customer, and not STORE, that controls energy, water usage and waste and recycling practices and that decides when and how to implement environmentally sustainable practices at a given property. While we do not control the business operations at our properties, as the property owner, we nevertheless recognize that the operation of commercial real estate assets can have a meaningful impact on the environment - particularly with respect to resource consumption and waste generation - and on the health of building occupants. At STORE, we are committed to environmental sustainability and the mitigation of environmental risks in connection with the development of our property portfolio. This commitment reflects the fact that the properties we acquire are subject to both state and federal environmental regulations, but, more importantly, it aligns with our belief that being conscious of, 2022 Proxy StatementS-5 Table of Contents and seeking to address and manage, environmental risks within our control, and supporting our customers to do the same in their businesses, plays a role in building and sustaining successful enterprises and, thus, is material to the success of our own business. Our environmental initiatives and partnerships focus on energy savings and carbon footprint reduction in our customers' facilities. As we are a triple-net lease REIT, without direct control of physical locations, our primary focus includes educating ourselves and our customers on evolving environmental strategies, soliciting feedback, gathering environmental data from our customers, developing relationships between our customers and environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") vendor partners and supporting our tenants in the implementation of green programs, including energy efficiency and carbon reduction programs. ï¿½?We Continuously Seek to Understand the Environmental Risks and Opportunities Associated with Our Business Practices.Our commitment to environmental sustainability begins before we acquire a real estate asset and involves, among other factors, a consideration of the environmental risks associated with our tenants and with prior users of the real estate asset. We then analyze environmental matters in each step of our three-phase property acquisition process. During our three-phase property acquisition process, we: ï¿½?Assess Potential Properties for Acquisition. We engage third parties to conduct comprehensive due diligence, including environmental evaluations and sustainable practices assessments, on each property we propose to buy. ï¿½?Address Environmental Conditions. Where we have identified one or more recognized environmental conditions, we seek to address them prior to acquisition, including requiring further testing, requiring the seller to remediate the issue in accordance with any state-mandated minimum requirements, submitting the property to any state voluntary compliance program, purchasing environmental insurance and preparing for climate-related natural disasters by requiring our tenants to carry insurance, including fire, wind/hail, earthquake, flood and other extended coverage, where appropriate, given the relative risk of loss, geographic location and industry best practices. ï¿½?Enforce Environmental Compliance. If we are satisfied with the results and outcome of our pre-acquisition due diligence process, we will then purchase the property and enter into a lease pursuant to which the customer will agree to certain environmental and other covenants and indemnities related to its continued use of the property. ï¿½?We Undertake Initiatives to Promote Greater Environmental Awareness Among Our Employees, Evaluate Opportunities to Enhance Our Processes and Promote Awareness and Engage with Our Tenants Regarding Sustainability Practices and Solutions. Although, under our triple-net lease business model, our customers control all business operations at our properties, we seek to positively influence the sustainability practices of our customers and vendors while constantly striving to improve our sustainability practices at our home office in Scottsdale, Arizona. ï¿½?For our Tenants. We conduct an annual customer outreach survey designed to gauge our customers' current sustainability practices. We believe encouragement of sustainability initiatives through education, ideas and support for property-level sustainability solutions, particularly related to energy, water and indoor environmental quality, can lead to the adoption of practices that should drive business and real estate value appreciation, decrease operating costs and mitigate regulatory risks. ï¿½?For our Vendors. We have adopted a Vendor Code of Conduct, which sets forth our standards for fair and ethical business practices, safe labor conditions, respect for human rights and environmental stewardship, as well as our expectations that our vendors and their subcontractors will comply with all applicable environmental rules and regulations while actively seeking to minimize the environmental impact of their business operations. ï¿½?For our Employees. We have established an ESG Working Group made up of a diverse group of management and employee representatives, which serves as an internal working group focused on developing and furthering our sustainability efforts, both at our home office and with our customers. The efforts of our ESG Working Group are overseen by a management-level ESG Committee that selects and coordinates our specific sustainability-related initiatives under the overall oversight of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board. S-6STORE Capital Corporation Table of Contents Social Responsibility and Human Capital Development  STORE believes that to continue to deliver strong financial results, we must execute on a human capital strategy that prioritizes, among other things: (i) establishing a work environment that attracts, develops and retains top talent; (ii) affording our employees an engaging work experience that allows for career development and opportunities for meaningful civic involvement; (iii) evaluating compensation and benefits and rewarding outstanding performance; (iv) engaging with, and obtaining feedback from, our employees on their workplace experiences; (v) enabling every employee, at every level, to be treated with dignity and respect, to be free from discrimination and harassment and to devote their full attention and best efforts to performing their job to the best of their respective abilities; and (vi) communicating with our Board on key topics. ï¿½?Corporate Donations and Volunteering. We strive to be a good corporate citizen in our community by supporting charitable organizations that promote education, environmentally sustainable practices and social well-being, and by encouraging our employees to personally commit to organizations that are meaningful to them. STORE is proud to support many local charities through financial and employee-driven volunteerism. ï¿½?Work Environment. Our Policy Statement on Human Rights demonstrates our commitment to maintaining a work environment where every employee, at every level, is treated with dignity and respect, is free from discrimination and harassment and is allowed to devote their full attention and best efforts to performing their job to the best of their respective abilities. ï¿½?Diversity. We have long acted to foster a diverse and vibrant workplace, seeking out individuals who possess a broad range of experiences, backgrounds and skills that enable us to anticipate and meet the needs of our business and those of our customers. Over time, we have hired, developed and retained a diverse workforce that is central to our success. Currently, 43% of our seven executive officers are women, and women hold 50% of our management positions at the level of Senior Vice President and above. Overall, STORE has a deep bench of men and women who are collectively capable of professionally operating the business and fulfilling our vision. ï¿½?Internship/Externship Programs. STORE is committed to developing talented individuals through our college internship program by providing career learning opportunities in several areas of our business. Internships with STORE often garner employment opportunities in our industry. ï¿½?Employee-Directed Engagement Initiatives. We are committed to creating a diverse and vibrant workplace for our employees that respects individuality, helps every person realize his or her full potential and includes persons with a broad range of experiences, backgrounds and skills that enable us to anticipate and meet the needs of our business and those of our customers. We conduct employee surveys frequently to receive valuable feedback on our initiatives and evaluate the results to develop new programs. STORE's employee-run ""engagement"" committees develop and influence new employee onboarding, personal growth and professional development programs, STORE social and team-building events and health and wellness programs. ï¿½?Support for the Fleischer Scholarship Program. Our Chair Emeritus, Morton H. Fleischer, founded the Fleischer Scholarship Program. This program provides high school students who are from underrepresented populations, have limited financial resources or are first generation students with a unique educational experience designed to help them prepare for college and their careers by exposing them to academic and career opportunities in business and helping them build leadership and communication skills. Through the generosity of Mr. Fleischer, and with corporate support provided by STORE and others, the program, including housing, meals and materials, is offered at no cost to all accepted students. ï¿½?Tenant Employment and Economic Impact. We seek to provide real estate financing solutions for our customers, backed by superior service, that help our customers grow and more efficiently manage their businesses. We target customers in the middle-market, a sector with more than 200,000 businesses with annual revenues between $10 million and $1 billion. Real estate financing alternatives for middle-market companies are limited. STORE's solutions enable our customers to build and grow sustainable businesses, positively impacting their investors, employees and local economies nationwide. 2022 Proxy StatementS-7 Table of Contents Corporate Governance and Ethical Business Practices At STORE, we believe that one of our most valuable corporate assets is our reputation for honesty, fairness and candor in all our business activities.

592,1,"WHD - Ocean County landscaping company ordered to pay $220K in back wages, civil penalties after federal investigation, administrative law judge decision, order",733 words,U.S. Government News and Documents via PUBT,"BAYVILLE, NJ - Following a U.S. Department of Labor investigation, an administrative law judge ordered a commercial landscaping company based in Bayville to pay 47 temporary landscaping workers $181,670.19 in back wages. The employer will also pay $38,329.81 in civil money penalties. The department's Wage and Hour Division[https://www-dol-gov.proxy.library.nyu.edu/agencies/whd] investigation determined that Turf Masters Inc. employed grasscutters for more than 50 hours per week, paid them sub-prevailing wage rates for all hours worked, and then attempted to hide these practices from the division. Turf Masters hired the workers from Mexico to work as grasscutters under the H-2B temporary non-agricultural workers visa program[https://www-dol-gov.proxy.library.nyu.edu/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/h-2b], which allows employers to temporarily hire foreign workers to perform nonagricultural labor or services in the United States. Specifically, the division found Turf Masters violated the H-2B program requirements to: * Pay the required prevailing wage rate, at the time, of $15.52 per hour and $23.28 for overtime hours worked. The employer instead paid the temporary workers approximately $11 an hour; * Reimburse workers for inbound and outbound travel expenses; and * Comply with retaining records and documents for three years from the date the H-2B application is certified, or from the date of adjudication if the application is denied, or from the day the department receives the letter of withdrawal if the employer withdraws the application. Investigators also determined that Turf Masters instructed workers to, among other things, falsely state that they never worked overtime hours. The department's Office of Administrative Law Judges issued a decision and order approving consent findings, which requires Turf Masters to pay back wages to resolve the wage violations. The landscaping company will also pay the civil money penalty assessed by the department due to the substantial nature of the violations. Additionally, the employer agreed to extensive enhanced compliance measures for the next four years that require the institution of an electronic timekeeping system; hiring of a bilingual monitor to conduct trainings, audits, and confidential interviews of all the company's H-2B workers every year and installation of GPS devices on each vehicle used to transport workers. ""Employees have a right to be paid their wages, to seek those wages and cooperate with investigators. The Wage and Hour Division will not tolerate interference with its investigations,"" said Wage and Hour Division District Director Charlene Rachor in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. ""This investigation underscores the department's commitment to using all enforcement tools to protect the rights of people who work in the U.S. Other employers should use the outcome of this investigation as an opportunity to review their own practices to make sure they comply with the law and avoid violations like those found in this case."" ""Employers who flout the rules of the H-2B program harm workers and gain unfair economic advantages. The U.S. Department of Labor will actively litigate such cases to achieve resolutions that ensure that applicants and workers are properly paid and prevent future violations,"" said regional Solicitor of Labor Jeffrey Rogoff in New York. The division's Southern New Jersey District Office conducted the investigation. Attorney Jacob Heyman-Kantor and Senior Trial Attorney Rolando Valdez with the department's regional Office of the Solicitor in New York litigated the case.

419,0,Sweden to lift most Covid curbs on Feb 9,444 words,Agence France Presse,"Vaccine passes for indoor events will no longer be required, and face masks will no longer be recommended on public transport at peak times. ""The pandemic is not over, but we are entering a whole new phase,"" Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told reporters. ""Knowledge about Omicron has improved... Several studies show Omicron leads to less serious illness."" While Omicron has led to a record number of infections in the past month, hospitalisations for severe infections have not overwhelmed the healthcare system. The country's Public Health Agency later in the day also said it was changing its testing recommendation, saying that there was no longer a need for the general public to get tested, even with symptoms. ""The testing capacity we have needs to be completely focused on the groups that really need testing,"" state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell told a press conference, adding that resources should be focused on staff and patients within healthcare. In addition, the Public Health Agency said it would formally petition the government to no longer designate Covid-19 as a public health threat. ""We now see that Covid-19 as a disease and a pandemic is completely different type of disease and pandemic than before, and therefore it is no longer reasonable to designate it as a threat to society,"" Tegnell said. More than 83 percent of people over the age of 12 have had two doses, and almost 50 percent have received third doses. Swedish Health Minister Lena Hallengren said the government would remain ""vigilant"" about the pandemic's progress. A return to working in person will resume gradually, as will university and higher education classes. However, authorities recommended that people continue to stay home if they have Covid-19 symptoms, and border restrictions will remain in place for the time being. Unvaccinated people are meanwhile advised to continue avoiding crowds after February 9. Sweden made headlines early in the pandemic for choosing to not impose lockdowns. With over 16,000 fatalities so far, its death toll is in line with the European average, but is far higher than those of neighbouring Norway, Finland and Denmark. Denmark on Tuesday became the first European Union country to lift most of its domestic Covid-19 restrictions, followed later in the day by Norway. hdy/po/jll/gw"

445,1,Volume growth triggers add fizz to Varun Beverages,469 words,Business Standard,"Varunâs estimated volume growth in Q4FY22 of 10 per cent (sector growth in lower single digits) is expected to be the highest in the consumer space, while revenue growth of just under 14 per cent is seen as the second highest (sector average at 7.9 per cent), according to IIFL Securities. Three-year compound annual growth rate of revenues at 22 per cent is also the highest across the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) universe, believe analysts. The volume gains are expected on the back of a pick-up in out-of-home consumption after two years of sluggish performance due to Covid. Aided by acquisitions and organic growth, the company had posted an annual sales volume growth of 20 per cent from 279 million unit cases in 2017 to 569 million unit cases in 2021. The companyâs product and capacity expansion could act as growth triggers. This, according to Devanshu Bansal and Ashit Desai of Emkay Global Research, is expected to come from a strong marketing push (refreshed Pepsi ï¿½?more fizz), portfolio expansion into lemon-based drinks (accounts for 40 per cent of the industry), and continued traction in energy drink âStingï¿½? New plants in Bihar and Jammu & Kashmir will help bring its products closer to customers, increase penetration, help gain market share, and improve profitability. Though revenue growth is expected to be strong, the company will face commodity headwinds. Most brokerages expect an operating profit margin impact of over 120 basis points (bps) year-on-year (YoY) in Q4FY22 at 15.9 per cent. The company, according to Kotak Institutional Equities, is facing inflationary pressure in PET chips, partly mitigated by low-cost inventory, operating leverage, and other cost saving initiatives such as light-weighting PET preforms. Expansion in international geographies such as the Congo, higher overseas contribution to overall revenues, and net profits and reduction of debt are expected to support the stock. Motilal Oswal Research expects the company to generate a free cash flow of ~2,670 crore over calendar year 2022 (CY22)-23 with overall debt expected to reduce to ~990 crore in CY23 from ~3,340 crore in CY21. At the current price, the stock, which hit its 52-week high on Wednesday, is trading at 36 times its CY23 earnings estimates. While growth prospects are strong, the stock (12 per cent higher over the past month) is trading near the target prices of most brokerages. Investors should wait for a better entry point."

728,1,"Mortgage Interest Rates for April 14, 2022: Rates Move Higher",1083 words,CNET News.com,"30-year fixed-rate mortgages The average 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate is 5.06%, which is a growth of 18 basis points compared to one week ago. (A basis point is equivalent to 0.01%.) Thirty-year fixed mortgages are the most common loan term. A 30-year fixed rate mortgage will usually have a lower monthly payment than a 15-year one -- but often a higher interest rate. Although you'll pay more interest over time -- you're paying off your loan over a longer timeframe -- if you're looking for a lower monthly payment, a 30-year fixed mortgage may be a good option. 15-year fixed-rate mortgages The average rate for a 15-year, fixed mortgage is 4.30%, which is an increase of 24 basis points compared to a week ago. You'll definitely have a bigger monthly payment with a 15-year fixed mortgage compared to a 30-year fixed mortgage, even if the interest rate and loan amount are the same. However, as long as you can afford the monthly payments, there are several benefits to a 15-year loan. These include typically being able to get a lower interest rate, paying off your mortgage sooner, and paying less total interest in the long run. 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgages A 5/1 ARM has an average rate of 5.01%, an addition of 18 basis points from the same time last week. With an adjustable-rate mortgage mortgage, you'll usually get a lower interest rate than a 30-year fixed mortgage for the first five years. However, changes in the market could cause your interest rate to increase after that time, as detailed in the terms of your loan. Because of this, an adjustable-rate mortgage could be a good option if you plan to sell or refinance your house before the rate changes. Otherwise, shifts in the market means your interest rate could be much higher once the rate adjusts. Mortgage rate trends Though 2022 kicked off with low mortgage rates, there has been an uptick recently, and rates are expected to continue climbing throughout 2022. Home loan rates are influenced by various economic factors. A major one is government policy set by the Federal Reserve, which raised rates in March for the first time since 2018 in response to record-high inflation. The Fed anticipates raising interest rates six more times this year. However, with the ongoing war in Ukraine, we've seen some fluctuations in mortgage rates, as global instability generally causes interest rates to drop. While you can expect rates to go up and down for these reasons, in general, if you're looking to buy a house in 2022, you should be prepared for interest rates to keep rising. We use information collected by Bankrate, which is owned by the same parent company as CNET, to track rate changes over time.

How to find the best mortgage rates To find a personalized mortgage rate, speak to your local mortgage broker or use an online mortgage service. In order to find the best home mortgage, you'll need to consider your goals and current finances. A range of factors -- including your down payment, credit score, loan-to-value ratio and debt-to-income ratio -- will all affect the interest rate on your mortgage. Having a good credit score, a larger down payment, a low DTI, a low LTV, or any combination of those factors can help you get a lower interest rate. Apart from the mortgage interest rate, other costs including closing costs, fees, discount points and taxes might also factor into the cost of your home. Be sure to comparison shop with multiple lenders -- including credit unions and online lenders in addition to local and national banks -- in order to get a mortgage loan that's right for you. How does the loan term impact my mortgage? When picking a mortgage, you should consider the loan term, or payment schedule. The mortgage terms most commonly offered are 15 years and 30 years, although you can also find 10-, 20- and 40-year mortgages. Mortgages are further divided into fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages. The interest rates in a fixed-rate mortgage are stable for the duration of the loan. Unlike a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rates for an adjustable-rate mortgage are only fixed for a certain amount of time (commonly five, seven or 10 years). After that, the rate fluctuates annually based on the market interest rate. One important factor to consider when choosing between a fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage is how long you plan on living in your home. Fixed-rate mortgages might be a better fit if you plan on living in a home for a while. Fixed-rate mortgages offer greater stability over time compared to adjustable-rate mortgages, but adjustable-rate mortgages may offer lower interest rates upfront. If you don't have plans to keep your new home for more than three to 10 years, however, an adjustable-rate mortgage could give you a better deal. The best loan term is entirely dependent on your personal situation and goals, so be sure to consider what's important to you when choosing a mortgage.  Click to view image.

374,0,The bubbles boom may be back but you can still bag a bargain,820 words,Irish Independent,"Thankfully, there are still plenty of bargains, if you avoid the big-name Champagne Houses. My top pick for value, complexity and versatility is Champagne Lombard from Dunnes Stores (see below) but the generous yet elegant Champagne Louis d'Or Brut (ï¿½?6, Mitchell & Son) and moreishly rich Tesco Finest Champagne Premier Cru Brut (ï¿½?5) are great choices. The always solid Pierre Darcys is reduced to half price until Valentine's Day (ï¿½?5, SuperValu). RosÃ© Champagne can be very food-friendly, thanks to the structure that the extra Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier bring. Charles Heidsieck RosÃ© Reserve (see below) is very special, or look to the bold, expressive MoÃ«t & Chandon Imperial (ï¿½?2 in Tesco) for a more affordable choice. Other versatile rosÃ© options include Bollinger and Laurent-Perrier the latter will star in a six-course Champagne feast at the K Club on March 3, if you'd prefer someone else to do the cooking. Beyond the jealously guarded borders of the Champagne region, however, lie plenty more bottle-fermented bubbles. The MÃ©thode Traditionnelle approach made famous in Champagne features throughout France (often called 'crÃ©mant') and beyond, from Italy (as Franciacorta) and Spain (as Cava, or Corpinnat) to South Africa, New Zealand, Tasmania and even England. Producers create a second fermentation in the sealed bottle to capture bubbles, and extended ageing on the lees (dead yeast) adds texture and flavour. These lees are later removed by riddling, and the wine is often blended with some reserve wines to balance flavours, and sweetened slightly (dosage) to round out the body. MÃ©thode Ancestrale wines are making a comeback too; often dubbed PÃ©t-Nat (aka PÃ©tillant Naturel), these are simpler, more rustic sparklers, achieved with a single primary fermentation that is allowed to finish in the bottle, and sold without filtering. Whichever you choose, may Cupid smile with you. Champagne Lombard Brut Nature Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs NV, France, 12.5pc, ï¿½?6 (from ï¿½?5, until February 14) Brut Nature (or bone dry) can be very austere in Champagne terms, but not so here, thanks to nutty and toasty aromas and savoury richness on the palate, allowing the mineralogy to shine and finishing long, lean and saline perfect for charred shellfish.

288,1,Mighty Good Solutions sues supplier over hand sanitizer contract,503 words,Kansas City Business Journal,"Mighty Good filed suit against BBD in Jackson County District Court on Feb. 1, and the case was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri on April 5. In April 2020, the suit says Florida-based BBD FL approached Mighty Good with an offer to sell hand sanitizer from a Texas-based supplier called Tri-Chem Specialty Chemicals LLC. BBD allegedly claimed that Tri-Chem had a trucking fleet for delivering sanitizer. BBD also said it had a relationship with a bottler called Terra Pharma Labs that could assist Mighty Good with producing bottles and pumps, as well as bottling hand sanitizer, according to the lawsuit. Mighty Good said it entered into a contract on June 23, 2020, making BBD its broker for facilitating the purchase and delivery of hand sanitizer from Tri-Chem. Mighty Good claims that BBD said all payments should be remitted to BBD, which would take its sourcing fee and immediately send the full amount due to Tri-Chem to fulfill the order. The first 750,000 bottles were to be delivered within one week and the remainder on or before July 19, 2020. Between June 9 and July 23, 2020, Mighty Good said it wired about $10.4 million to BBD. The lawsuit claims it took a month, not a week, to receive the first 750,000 bottles. The company said it received only 1,180,440 of the 2 million bottles of hand sanitizer it paid BBD to procure. Mighty Good also accuses BBD of failing to fully remit all the money to Tri-Chem for its order, retaining funds in excess of the sourcing fee that BBD is not entitled to keep. Instead, the suit says, BBD asked Mighty Good to send additional money to receive shipments the company already had paid for in full. As a result of the delays, Samâs Club canceled a hand sanitizer purchase order from Mighty Good. Mighty Good accuses BBD of breach of contract, unjust enrichment, conversion and fraud. Meghan Lamping of Cormody MacDonald PC in St. Louis represents Mighty Good. BBD representatives did not respond to a request for comment. The company received an extension of time of time to file an answer to the complaint. BBD is represented by Mayer Klein of Frankel Rubin Klein Siegel Payne & Pudlowski PC in Clayton, Missouri.

137,0,Sarah Willingham: âI bought my first home on a credit cardï¿½?1385 words,sundaytimes.co.uk,"The Restaurant . In 2015 she joined the BBCâs Dragonsï¿½?Den for two series before leaving to travel the world with her family. She lives in Brighton with her husband, fellow investor Michael Toxvaerd, and their four children, Minnie, 15, Monti, 14, Nelly, 12, and Marley, 10. How much is in your wallet? Nothing. In fact I donât even have an actual wallet any more. Everything is in my virtual wallet, attached to Apple Pay on my phone, and I donât miss cash except for perhaps giving buskers or homeless people a few quid. What credit cards do you use? I have the Platinum and British Airways American Express cards, which are great as we travel a lot and the lounge access and travel insurance is brilliant. I pay them off every month, although there have been times when credit cards have tided me over. Donât do this at home, but I actually bought my first house with a credit card. It was about 25 years ago, and I bought the 10 per cent deposit on a credit card when you could get cash back on it. It was a two-bedroom flat in South Hampstead, which ended up being a great investment. I paid off the Â£10,000 gradually over two years but my return on investment was much higher as the property market increased far more than any interest I was paying on the credit card. Iâm not scared of debt. If you can get more return on your capital than the cost of borrowing, youâre better off as long as you are mitigating your risk. I look at whatâs the downside in everything I do. The risk of doing this interview would be that my humility and normality would not come across and Iâd look like a rich idiot. Donât write that. Are you a saver or a spender? Iâm definitely not a saver. Iâm a considered spender, but actually what I am is an investor, and thatâs different. Iâm a typical entrepreneur. Every time anything was coming in Iâd already earmarked it for another opportunity. How did the pandemic affect you? There was definitely a mild panic. Before our lockdown Mike and I just went, âThis is going to be absolute carnage.What on earth does this mean for our investments, for our businesses?ï¿½?Our worse-case scenario was that weâd lose everything. Weâre heavily invested in small businesses and all the bars we were involved with closed overnight. We had to take on significant debt and utilise government loans, but, like typical entrepreneurs, we react well to change. By the summer the demand for our Craft Gin Club had gone through the roof. That business is now worth over Â£100 million. And when the customer-facing businesses were reopened demand went stratospheric. In September 2020 we came up with Nightcap ï¿½?a late-night, high-quality party bar firm. We floated it in January 2021 for Â£12 million with zero bars and now itâs worth Â£40 million with 27 bars and another 25 in the pipeline. I think hospitality is the industry to back now. Prices are low. Property is low. But demand is higher than ever. Have you ever been really hard up? Oh my God yes. In fact a lot more of my life than not. It has always been this compromise between cash and equity. Iâd always put my last thousand pounds into an investment. I made my first million when I was 31 and it has been different since then. Before that point I lived in Paris in an awful flat in a dodgy area for two years and earned a normal salary. I lived on Pot Noodles. The flat was so basic that the lavatory was only separated from my bed by a shower curtain. It was disgusting, but it made me think Iâve got to get out of here. Do you own a property? We have a place in Primrose Hill, which we love and use. During our travels we decided to sell the lovely big country house in Oxfordshire and weâre currently renting in Brighton, where the children go to school, trying to find what will be the next ten-year home. Are you better off than your parents? Yes, miles better. My mum was a maths teacher and my dad worked at Wedgwood Potteries as a supply chain manager. We lived in a lovely semi-detached house with three bedrooms and a red Sierra parked outside. It was a gorgeous childhood, but I know that what Iâve achieved in my life has far exceeded everybodyâs expectations, including my own. Whatâs better for retirement ï¿½?property or pension? Iâve got a pension as its tax efficient, and Iâve got property, but itâs not where I create value and Iâm not particularly good at property. The most important thing to consider with retirement is to do what youâre good at. People talk about doing something you enjoy but thatâs a bit of a middle-class luxury. Do what youâre good at. Liking something doesnât put bread on the table. What has been your best investment? The Craft Gin Club, definitely. I got involved with that on Dragonsï¿½?Den five years ago ï¿½?there was a big fight between Peter Jones, Deborah Meaden and myself ï¿½?and I ended up investing Â£75,000 at a valuation of half a million and it is worth at least double that today. Whatâs the most extravagant thing youâve bought? Last summer I felt like I needed to give myself 20 lashes for buying a pair of Â£1,800 Chanel shoes. I could not believe Iâd done it, but they were the most beautiful pair of shoes ever. Whatâs your money weakness? Apart from blimminï¿½?school fees for my kids, which cost a fortune, my weakness is travel. I took my kids out of school for a year and we went around the world, which was amazing. It was the best thing Iâve ever done in my life. We had a daily budget of Â£400 for six people, which the kids managed. Thatâs not bad for that many people but it does add up. What is your financial priority? Maintaining my freedom. Iâve always got my eye on independence. I just donât want anyone else to tell me what Iâve got to do on a Monday morning. Ever. What would you do if you won the lottery? Go on more extravagant holidays. And Iâd give back a bit more. My kids are still young, so Iâm still focused on getting them though their education. My next chapter is to help others beyond my immediate family unit more. Do you support any charities? Iâm an ambassador for In Kind Direct, which is one of the Prince of Walesâs charities, and focuses on minimising waste. I also lost my best friend and childhood soulmate to suicide last year, so I think that Iâll be increasingly involved with charities in that area. What is the most important lesson youâve learnt about money? Money has never been a driver for me and thatâs really important. Youâve got to be driven by life goals. Money doesnât buy you freedom and independence, but it plays a very important part in completing the picture. Sarah Willingham is the founder of the bar company Nightcap",

43,0,COVID reveals the weakness of China's authoritarianism,1130 words,The Boston Globe,"It is easy to see why some people would find zero COVID admirable. But keeping the policy going at this point requires steps that seem unsustainably invasive and stifling ï¿½?both socially and economically ï¿½?and amount to an admission that China's vaccines do not work as well as Western ones do. Omicron has put China between a rock and a hard place. The variant's high transmissibility ensures that the costs of the zero-COVID approach will grow, because more and more lockdowns will be needed to keep the virus at bay. But despite the economic toll, Chinese President Xi Jinping has shown no indication of backing down from his policy. Having spent two years painting himself as the leader who beat COVID-19, he knows that any relaxation and subsequent spike in cases and deaths would spoil that image. Xi's paralysis should be expected from a ruler who has replaced China's top-level collectivism with personalism, creating a regime in which there are few constraints on his authority. These are the predicaments of a strongman. Beijing is likely, then, to keep going with strict lockdowns not because zero COVID is necessarily the ideal policy but because Xi sees no way out that has risks low enough to be acceptable to him ï¿½?because he would own the policy in failure just as he did in success. China is currently facing what is by far its worst COVID-19 surge since the initial Wuhan outbreak, recording thousands of cases per day, even though about 85 percent of Chinese have been fully vaccinated against the virus. In recent weeks, Shenzhen, a hugely important manufacturing city near Hong Kong, has been in full lockdown. So, too, has Jilin Province. Shanghai has already closed its schools and businesses, while numerous compounds across Beijing and Tianjin have shut down as well. Over the last few weeks, some 51 million people have been locked down across China. Chinese officials are trying more consciously than before to mitigate the negative economic impact of zero COVID. Xi has urged officials to take what Chinese state television called more âeffectiveï¿½?measures that minimize âthe impact of the epidemic on economic development.ï¿½?Therefore, authorities are no longer sending all asymptomatic individuals to hospitals but instead to centralized quarantine facilities, which the government is erecting in hard-hit areas. Officials have also modified their approach toward Shenzhen, which is a particularly important link in the global supply chain, producing key items like semiconductors and circuit boards. Manufacturing is allowed to continue there while the city is locked down, essentially implementing the bubble concept that was used for the Beijing Olympics. But even though China has shown a bit of flexibility, Beijing will still lean toward a fundamentally hardline approach. Xi said as much on March 17, when state media reported him as declaring that China will âstick withï¿½?its zero-COVID strategy. The truth is that Xi has not yet found an acceptable alternative. And why does he have no alternative? Because China's vaccines do not work as well as Western ones do ï¿½?as the World Health Organization has reported and as even Chinese officials have admitted. China's vaccines are not made with the mRNA technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna shots that have largely prevented death and severe illness throughout the Omicron wave in the United States and other countries. So if China opens up, the health care system could be flooded with symptomatic patients. And China's health care system is so unprepared for epidemic-type spread that any major shift from zero COVID would risk a public health crisis, with hospitalization and fatality numbers in some locations perhaps resembling those of pre-vaccine New York City or Italy or the recent situation in Hong Kong. The result, as many have pointed out, would be to undermine public confidence in the ruling Communist Party, whose official rhetoric has recently leaned heavily on the country's success in avoiding the chaos COVID-19 has wrought just about everywhere else. For a personalized regime like that of Xi, experiencing such chaos after holding it off for so long would be hard to swallow. This is a key downside of centralized power: When you appear to control everything, anything that goes wrong is inevitably your fault. Finding a believable scapegoat is difficult when you claim to exercise supreme authority. And pivoting to what appears like a reasonable solution ï¿½?procuring and rolling out Western-made vaccines ï¿½?might be too stark an about-face for a leader who has taken such a nationalistic and anti-Western line and whose state media has declared these vaccines worse than those made in China. Xi is not at risk of losing power. Beijing's leadership has banked credibility from decades of economic success and maintains considerable control over society and public discourse. But Xi has backed himself into a corner. He is facing an unrelenting strain of COVID-19, economic headwinds, and now, of course, Russia's war in Ukraine, which has the West threatening to impose severe sanctions on China at an inopportune moment. His regime may not be flexible enough to find a good way out. China's struggle to change direction at this critical moment is a painful reminder of autocracy's flaws. Indeed, it is hard for the Chinese system to reverse policies once they are well-established precisely because decisions are made in a top-down and unified manner, without feedback loops and the local policy freedoms that can facilitate more incremental change. Those who believe autocracy produces better governance ï¿½?as more than a few observers argued when China and other one-party states initially controlled COVID-19 ï¿½?would do well to remember that China is struggling to develop a long-term plan for handling the pandemic not despite being an autocracy but because of it.

920,0,"Gomez, Samberg check out of 'Hotel'",902 words,USA Today,"Mavis and Johnny ""are a good onscreen couple. Relationship goals ï¿½?that's what you wanted me to say, right?"" jokes Samberg, 43, whose NBC sitcom ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" finished its eight-season run last year. For Gomez, 29, who stars in Hulu comedy ""Only Murders in the Building,"" saying goodbye to these films is ""so weird. Especially for me, in my 20s and now going on to 30s, it's really interesting to have grown up with this character. It's been such a delight."" The actors talk to USA TODAY about their friendship and more: Question: The two of you met while promoting the first movie. What did you initially bond over? Selena Gomez: Andy was really sweet. I was a little pipsqueak back then and he was making me laugh. And when weird questions would come up, he would deflect and it was very nice. I remember feeling very comfortable, like, ""This is fun."" Andy Samberg: It's interesting doing press with Selena. She gets a whole other variety of questions than I get ï¿½?it's been fascinating for me to see. She deals with it very gracefully, but man, I wouldn't trade. Q: In ""Transformania,"" Johnny feels that he needs to change himself in order to be accepted. Is that something either of you could relate to in your own lives? Gomez: Guilty. Maybe it's because of social media and the pressure. I definitely have felt like maybe I wasn't good enough or I should look a certain way. I had a hard time, but it's actually been four years for me without social media on my phone besides TikTok. So it's been wonderful. I still post and do what I do, but I've learned to have a balance with it and not let it consume me. Samberg: Everyone has (felt that way) at one point or another, it's just human nature. Especially when you're a kid and a teenager, you're trying to figure out who you are and where you fit in the world, and it's really easy to believe what other people tell you about yourself. But I certainly never thought I needed to change myself into a Godzilla monster. Q: Andy, has your daughter watched these films yet? (Samberg has a 4-year-old with his wife, musician Joanna Newsom.) Samberg: She's still a little too young, but I'm feeling really confident knowing I have four in the hopper. I actually made a choice to stop watching all the animated stuff over the last four years so that I would have it saved up to watch for the first time when she does start, so we can do it together. Gomez: Oooh, that's so sweet. Q: What are some movies that you're most excited to show her? Samberg: Dude, I haven't seen ""Moana"" or ""Coco"" or ""Encanto."" Those are the ones where I'm like, ""Oh, my God, I can't wait to see these movies. I've been waiting for four years!"" (Laughs.) It's going to be exciting. I was talking to my wife the other day about how I can't wait to watch ""E.T."" with her. Stuff like that where we're both like, ""Oh, we're going to cry!"" Q: Selena, congratulations on your first Grammy nomination (for Spanish-language EP ""Revelacin,"" nominated for best Latin pop album). How did it feel to be recognized for music that is so personal to you? Gomez: I cried. (Laughs.) I was very excited. It's wonderful, I did not expect that at all. This is something I worked really hard on ï¿½?honestly, probably harder than any other album because I wanted to make sure that with it being Spanish that it's authentic, it sounds real, it's emotional and beautiful and poetic, which is what I love about Spanish music. I wanted it to be all of that, but it's really difficult not being completely fluent in the language. So there were times where it was really, really hard and I'm so proud of everyone that got to be a part of it. Q: You hinted in Vogue last year about potentially retiring from music. Could you still see that happening? Gomez: I think I just said it wrong. The idea of retirement for me isn't that I would leave forever, it is that I do see myself taking a significant break from music. Not personally ï¿½?I think I'll always be creating and doing music and hopefully maybe even do some side projects with people. I just want to maybe take a step back, but I'm not doing that anytime soon."
776,0,News Corp probes cyber attack it suspects was linked to China,341 words,Financial Times,"The people behind the attack ""are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests"", News Corp's chief technology officer, David Kline, said in the email. The company, which owns the Wall Street Journal, discovered the breach on January 20 and said that the hackers accessed documents from News Corp headquarters, Dow Jones, News UK and the New York Post. It hired Mandiant, a cyber security company, to investigate. ""We will not tolerate attacks on our journalism, nor will we be deterred from our reporting,"" said Kline. Kline said that he believed the attack was ""contained"" but warned that the company was ""in the early stages of our investigation"". The White House last year accused the Chinese government of teaming up with criminal gangs to commit widespread cyber attacks on US companies and government agencies. US president Joe Biden warned last year that cyber attacks could escalate into a ""real shooting war"". This week the FBI said that Beijing had unleashed a ""massive, sophisticated hacking programme that is bigger than those of every other major nation combined"". In 2013, the Wall Street Journal and New York Times reported they had been hacked by China. China has a historically fraught relationship with western journalists. The situation had escalated in recent years as US-Sino relations chilled. In February 2020, the Chinese government expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters after the publication ran an opinion piece headlined: ""China is the Real Sick Man of Asia"". The following month, China revoked press credentials of US journalists at the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal."
842,0,Spotify chooses conspiracy theorist over Neil Yong,278 words,Dong-A Ilbo Daily,"In response, Spotify on Wednesday turned its back on Young with the show to go on. It wrote, 'We want all the world's music and audio content to be available to Spotify users,' going on to say, 'We regret Neil's decision to remove his music from Spotify, but hope to welcome him back soon.' Comedian Joe Rogan-hosted Podcast program garners as many as 11 million listeners for every episode. Cast members including the host have recently sparked controversy by commenting that vaccine-related deaths are explosively rising and it is a mass formation psychosis to get vaccinated. A group of 270 medical specialists recently wrote a letter of protest to Spotify that Rogan's show dampens public trust in scientific research while spreading socially malign sentiments. Born in Canada, Neil Young produced many great songs such as 'Heart of Gold,' 'Old Man,' 'Down by the River' and 'Like a Hurricane.' Ranking 32nd among the Rolling Stones 100 Greatest Artists in 2000, he was awarded Best Rock Song in the Grammy Awards 11 years later."
756,0,Social media platforms must address Russia's Spanish-language misinformation,847 words,The Boston Globe,"That's because social media posts in Spanish have spread rapidly with propaganda and conspiracy theories that blame the United States for the armed conflict and accuse the United States of not telling the world a key fact: that there are American chemical and bioweapon development facilities in Ukraine that were threatening to Russia. Not surprisingly, the media outlet pushing the biolabs conspiracy theory ï¿½?already debunked ï¿½?is RT en EspaÃ±ol, the Russian-controlled television network. Its Facebook page in Spanish posted as recently as Thursday morning a clip of Russia's defense ministry announcing that Russian experts have found new evidence that biological weapons were being developed secretly in Ukrainian labs funded by the United States. It bears repeating: That is false information. And yet the Facebook post remains unflagged as such and continues to rake in high levels of engagement through hundreds of likes, shares, and comments. Similar Spanish-language posts have been flagged by mis- and disinformation experts to urge Facebook and other tech companies to do more to detect and delete these blatant falsehoods. This isn't a new issue. Misinformation in Spanish has rapidly spread on social platforms ï¿½?and often gone unchecked or left up longer than it survives in English ï¿½?about the COVID-19 vaccines and the 2020 presidential election. As the Russian invasion unfolded in Ukraine, Facebook and TikTok banned Russian state media in Europe, while YouTube blocked them globally as it became evident that Kremlin-controlled outlets were spreading propaganda. But according to experts, Spanish-language misinformation and conspiracy theories have a longer shelf life than their English counterparts on social media because, by and large, the platforms are not dedicating enough resources and time to fight them. It's way overdue: Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and Twitter better catch up and take the threat of Spanish-language misinformation seriously. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus is on it and requested meetings with Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and Twitter earlier this year to urge them to take more aggressive steps to tackle misinformation in Spanish. Members of the caucus âhave also called publicly for online platforms to release information on their effectiveness at detecting the prevalence of violative content separated by language,"" wrote caucus members in letters sent to the four tech companies in January. âEverything they do in English should be mimicked in Spanish,"" Democratic Representative Ruben Gallego of Arizona, a member of the caucus, told Politico. The false biolabs narrative has become particularly pernicious and resistant to purging. According to a review by Media Matters, in partnership with the Latino Anti-Disinformation Lab, the Russian-owned news agency Sputnik Mundo is also pushing the conspiracy theory on Twitter and Facebook that the United States âwas experimenting with bat coronavirus samples in the biological laboratories"" that they falsely claim America has in Ukraine. There's also evidence that Russia's propaganda efforts in Spanish began before the war started and that Facebook should be doing more to fight them. âBefore Russia invaded, RT en EspaÃ±ol was spreading this idea that the United States was the reason for possible escalation,"" said Jacobo Licona, a disinformation researcher at Equis Labs, a Latinx research and polling company. Those misleading posts, he said, âhad a very high level of engagement."" As a corrective measure, Facebook said it would try to lower engagement by not recommending those RT en EspaÃ±ol posts to users. But Licona told me engagement at RT en EspaÃ±ol is even higher than before the invasion. âFrom January 23 to February 23, there were on average 56,000 daily interactions on the page. But since February 24 to now, the average has nearly doubled to almost 100,000 daily interactions,"" Licona said. The problem with misinformation is that it doesn't have any borders, Licona said. âContent originated in Latin America often reaches the US Spanish-language community and vice versa."" What's more, a video with misinformation in English that's posted on YouTube may not get flagged and removed before a Latin American influencer does their own Spanish version, which eventually makes its way to the Spanish-language-speaking audience in the United States. It's a vicious cycle. âSpanish-language misinformation is a challenge of hemispheric proportions,"" Licona said. He is right. And whether it is about US elections, the coronavirus vaccine, the Russia-Ukraine war, or even social movements like Black Lives Matter, Spanish-language misinformation cannot remain a blind spot for the tech companies any longer.

He said that despite ongoing pressure on the health system, the rate of hospital admissions and discharges and a shorter duration and less severe illness for the Omicron variant compared to Delta allowed authorities to ease the curbs. Capacity restrictions will remain in place for sport events, while a double mask is mandatory in supermarkets and transport. Greece reported 19,712 new cases on Thursday.

726,0,News of the World publisher fails in bid to end phone-hacking claims,600 words,The Guardian,"Rupert Murdochâs News Group Newspapers (NGN), which published the now defunct newspaper as well as the Sun, asked for litigation to be brought to an end 15 years after the scandal broke. About 1,028 claims have already been settled, plus an additional 358 applications that were made to a compensation scheme run by parent company News International between 2011 and 2016. But NGNâs lawyers were rebuffed when they argued at a hearing in London that it is time to impose a final deadline on potential victims to file new claims against the organisation. The failed bid comes as the Sun recorded a loss of Â£51m last year. NGN spent Â£49m on legal fees and damages relating to historical phone-hacking allegations in the year to 27 June 2021. This compares with the Â£80m NGN spent the previous year. There could be as many as ï¿½?0,000 to 25,000 potential victims of NGNâs unlawful information gatheringï¿½?and there should be no cut-off date, lawyers representing a number of victims argued. David Sherborne, representing the claimant group, said NGNâs application for a final cut-off date was âmisconceivedï¿½? He argued that the âvast majority of victims do not know they have a claim due to the intentionally covert nature of NGNâs unlawful information gathering and its deliberate concealment of the sameï¿½? Anthony Hudson QC, for NGN, told the court on Thursday: âWe say after 15 years of litigation, the resolution and compromise of more than 1,000 claims, the enormous use of court time during that period, vast quantities of disclosure [of evidence] and the huge costs that have been incurred and paid, we suggest that now is the appropriate time to ensure that any intended claims are brought within a reasonable time and that the slow drip-feed of the evidence ï¿½?which on the claimantsï¿½?approach could last many more years, possibly another decade ï¿½?is brought to a conclusion.ï¿½?The barrister said there have been about 45 hearings since 2016, taking up about 70 hours of court time, and that legal costs have been âexorbitantï¿½? with total costs for the third tranche of the litigation alone reaching nearly Â£35m. He said allegations had been in the public domain since former News of the World journalist Clive Goodman was arrested in 2006 and that it would be âdifficult for anyone living in this country to be unawareï¿½?of the phone-hacking scandal. But giving judgment on Friday, Mr Justice Fancourt said he did not agree with NGNâs submission that the majority of potential victims already know they could make a claim. The judge said: âMore claims are now being brought that do not arise from an article being published. Even when claimants did have an article published about them, it is not obvious this was how the information was gathered.ï¿½?He added that new claimants were still learning of potential claims after appearing as witnesses in other claimantsï¿½?cases, but said the courtâs position may change in the future. The court heard that there are currently 52 claims registered, with a further 436 claims at the pre-action letter stage and 82 more âin the pipelineï¿½?"
158,0,Domestic restaurant chains could replace closed McDonald's in Moscow in a year - mayor,420 words,Interfax: Russia & CIS Business and Financial Newswire,"In order to fill niches ""that foreign colleagues are vacating,"" the Moscow authorities have decided to allocate 500 million rubles in preferential direct lending to create additional fast food chains, he said. ""There are special measures directed toward counteracting special closures of those or other enterprises that are closing without any kind of objective conditions. For example you know that the work of McDonald's has ceased for two months. There are around 250 locations that work in the McDonald's system in Moscow. Of course, it's unpleasant - many people have gotten used to going to McDonald's . But one needs to be aware that there are 12,000 public catering enterprises in Moscow, they're all different, work in different areas, but this is a giant network, a humongous network as has never been in Moscow and which was created for the most part in the past 5-7-8 years, and it's a world-class network,"" Sobyanin said at a meeting with the leaders of Moscow trade and service enterprises. The U.S. corporation McDonald's said on Tuesday that it was temporarily closing all its restaurants in Russia and suspending all operations on the Russian market over events in Ukraine. McDonald's President and CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a letter to employees published on the company's website on Tuesday that McDonald's would continue paying salaries to all its employees in Russia and that the Ronald McDonald House Charities would continue its activities in Russia and Ukraine. jk pr ak (Our editorial staff can be reached at eng.editors@interfax.ru)"

705,1,U.S. Retail Sales Rose 0.5% in March -- 2nd Update,959 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"Consumers increased retail and restaurant spending by 0.5% in March compared with the previous month, the Commerce Department said Thursday, down from the revised monthly increase of 0.8% in February. Sales at gas stations accounted for much of the increase with an 8.9% jump over the previous month, reflecting sharply higher fuel prices related to the Ukraine war. Excluding gasoline sales, retail sales fell by 0.3%. Declines in online shopping and auto sales held back spending totals. Overall retail sales would have been even higher if not for a 1.9% monthly auto sales decline. Auto companies struggled with a vehicle shortage during the pandemic due to supply disruptions, pushing prices up sharply. Sales also declined sharply at online retailers, a 6.4% drop over February. Spending rose for a range of other categories, including appliances, electronics, groceries, dining out and clothing. But gains only outpaced inflation in three categories: sporting goods, electronics, and general merchandise, according to Tim Quinlan, senior economist at Wells Fargo. Retail sales aren't adjusted for inflation; on an adjusted basis, retail sales fell by 0.7% last month, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and economist estimates. Annual consumer inflation surged to a new four-decade high of 8.5% in March from the same month a year ago, the Labor Department said Tuesday. Rising costs, especially for gasoline, are likely leading to changes in consumers' behavior to cushion the impact on their budgets. While gasoline prices rose at 18.3% in March over February, the increase in sales was less than half of that. ""The fact that prices themselves were up roughly 20% in the month shows that consumers are combining trips or working from home to not spend as much time in the car,"" Mr. Quinlan said. Consumers have moved away from some pandemic-era spending habits, shifting more spending to services and away from physical goods. Higher prices have also decreased demand for some discretionary purchases, such as furniture, which saw a modest rise in sales in March that didn't keep up with inflation. Households instead are spending more on staples such as food, gasoline and utilities, economists said. They also are returning to shop in physical stores rather than online as the surge from the Omicron variant has faded, with sales at non-store retailers declining for three of the last four months. Despite higher prices, consumers have shown a willingness to spend on activities that were limited earlier in the pandemic. Airlines are reporting strong demand for leisure travel, and local economies that are dependent on tourism have been buoyed by the return of out-of-towners. Juan's Flying Burrito, a New Orleans-based restaurant group with five locations, has seen a 60% increase in sales over last year and is nearing prepandemic levels of business, one of its owners said. The return of tourists for Mardi Gras and New Orleans' role as host for this month's college basketball Final Four tournament have juiced sales. They are expecting another bump when the city hosts two big music festivals this spring, including its famous Jazz and Heritage Festival, after the pandemic forced multiple cancellations of the events. ""Since Covid started receding and the city started loosening restrictions with these big events, sales have definitely ticked up,"" co-owner Jay Morris said. Still, shortages and skyrocketing prices for key ingredients mean the restaurant chain still faces challenges. It is paying $100 per case of limes, which is more than five times what they previously cost, Mr. Morris said, and avocado prices are up strongly, too. ""It's really hard to not have those in a Mexican-concept restaurant,"" he said. Gasoline prices, along with broader inflation, have taken a toll on consumer confidence. Public expectations for the level of inflation a year from now hit a record in March, according to a survey released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The bank said respondents think that inflation is likely to stay elevated in the medium-term, rather than resolving over the next several months. Those expectations have risen as the pace of inflation has reached a rate last seen 40 years ago. The survey found that expectations for food and gasoline prices increased last month relative to February. ""People have an outsized view of gas prices on their overall economic health, but they're also a core material for many other products,"" said Jonathan Silver, chief executive of Affinity Solutions, a consumer-data firm. Some retailers say they are still struggling to keep up with demand because of continued supply-chain challenges, which can lead to long wait times for some products. Scarcity has led vendors to request price markups on their merchandise, sometimes more than once a month for a single product, said Chuck Millsaps, president of Great Outdoor Provision Co., a recreational retailer with nine stores in North Carolina and Virginia. ""When we're able, we've pushed orders ahead,"" Mr. Millsaps said. ""We used to say, don't ship it until it's 70% complete. Now we say, whatever you've got, ship it."" Complicated products with multiple components, like kayaks, might arrive without key parts that have been stranded elsewhere. ""We have to tell customers, well, your boat is here, but your seats are still in Asia."" Write to Gabriel T.

538,1,"FEDERAL GOVT, SABAH AGREE AMOUNT OF SPECIAL GRANT INCREASED BY 4.7 FOLDS",547 words,Bernama Daily Malaysian News,"The amount was increased after the Federal government and the Sabah government reached an agreement on the review of the special grantÂ to Sabah under Article 112D of the Federal Constitution today, following several discussions and negotiationsÂ by the Finance Ministry and the Sabah government, with most of the terms agreed on Feb 14, 2022. This marked an important review as the last review was done in 1969. The new agreement also covers other matters, including for the federal government and the Sabah government toÂ continue negotiation on the 40 per cent revenue claim by Sabah. According to the joint statement, this is to get a new amount for the special grant that can balance Sabah's needs without affecting the federal governmentâs financial position. Â ""If a new amount agreed by both parties is reached before 2026, then the new amount will be used to replace the special grant payment for Sabah starting 2022,"" it said. The statement also stated that the agreement was made without prejudice to the obligations and rights of the federal government and the Sabah government to continue to review the special grantÂ under Article 112D of the Federal Constitution by taking into account the financial position of the federal government and the needs of the Sabah government. It said the Sabah government also had the right to rely on the original formula as stated in Article 112C and Part IV of the Tenth Schedule of the Federal Constitution. Implementation of the review on the special grant includes the right of both the Federal government and the Sabah government to refer the matter to an independent assessor (if no agreement is reached) as stated in Article 112D (6) of the Federal Constitution. The federal government and the Sabah government also agreed to provide the data and information on the financial position of the federal government, as well as the needs of the Sabah government pertaining to the cost of state services, which will be taken into account in the process of reviewing the special grant. Â According to the statement, the agreement reached between the federal government and the Sabah government symbolises the spirit of the Keluarga Malaysia,Â the federal government's commitment under the Federal Constitution and the 1963 Malaysia Agreement to the Sabah government and the state's concern for the role and ability of the federal government to bring development and prosperity. Â ""Our appreciation to the federal governmentâs delegation led by the Minister of Finance (Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz) and the Sabah governmentâs delegation, led by the Sabah Minister of Finance II (Datuk Seri Masidi Manjun) for this historic achievement,"" stated the joint statement.

846,0,Neil Young Demands Spotify Remove His Music -- 4th Update,970 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"Mr. Young didn't respond to requests for comment. The letter came in response to ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast, which is currently Spotify's most popular podcast and also tops Apple 's podcasting charts. In 2020, Mr. Rogan signed an exclusive podcasting deal with Spotify, worth more than $100 million, according to people familiar with the matter. ""With an estimated 11 million listeners per episode, JRE, which is hosted exclusively on Spotify, is the world's largest podcast and has tremendous influence. Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform,"" Mr. Young wrote in the letter. ""I want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform...They can have Rogan or Young. Not both."" While Mr. Young's label, Warner Music Group Corp .'s Warner Records, is the licensor to Spotify and may legally have control over how and where his music is distributed, it is typical for a record company to take an artist's wishes into account. An act of Mr. Young's cachet in particular tends to have more control over their career and creative output. If a decision is reached to remove the music, Spotify could take it down in a matter of hours, according to people familiar with the matter. Streaming accounts for 84% of recorded music revenue in the U.S., according to the Recording Industry Association of America . Spotify is by far the largest music-streaming service by paid subscriptions. Mr. Young's letter cited an episode of the podcast in which Mr. Rogan spoke with Dr. Robert Malone, a virologist who worked on research into several mRNA Covid-19 vaccines but who is now critical of the treatments. Among the claims made was the suggestion that hospitals have been financially motivated to falsely diagnose deaths as having been caused by Covid-19. Mr. Rogan has regularly used his podcast to discuss Covid-19 vaccines and restrictions, railing against vaccine mandates for indoor events and suggesting that young, healthy people shouldn't be vaccinated.  Spotify's bet on Mr. Rogan's show has caused trouble in the past for the audiostreaming company. Some employees expressed concern over the podcast's content during a town-hall meeting in September 2020, relating to material they felt was anti-transgender, according to people familiar with the matter. The company stood by its star podcaster, with Chief Executive Daniel Ek saying that the ambition to make Spotify the ""largest audio platform in the world"" involves embracing diverse voices and differing opinions as the company chases scale in podcasting. ""The most important thing for us is to have very clear policies in place, "" he said in an interview a month after the town hall. ""It doesn't matter if you're Joe Rogan or anyone else, we do apply those policies and they need to be evenly applied."" Earlier this month, a group of 270 scientists and healthcare professionals signed an open letter to Spotify accusing the podcast of ""promoting baseless conspiracy theories"" and asking the service to take action against mass-misinformation events on its platform. ""Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Joe Rogan has repeatedly spread misleading and false claims on his podcast, provoking distrust in science and medicine,"" it said. Since the start of the pandemic, Spotify has removed over 20,000 Covid-related podcast episodes as a result of creators violating its policies, according to a person familiar with the matter. While more than 40 of Mr. Rogan's episodes have been removed, none of them have been related to the pandemic, this person said. Mr. Young also launched his own streaming service in 2018 called the "" Neil Young Archives,"" which offers different yearly subscriptions ranging from $19.99 to $99.99 to access the artist's albums. Mr. Young has previously had issues with streaming platforms. In 2015, he said he didn't need his content ""to be devalued by the worst quality in the history of broadcasting or any other form of distribution"" and that he was pulling his music from streaming services. The artist's music returned to Spotify in 2016. ""That's where people get music,"" he later told Rolling Stone . Monday's letter wasn't the first time the outspoken 76-year-old has used his website to take on big companies in the music business. Last summer, Mr. Young criticized concert promoters in a post, calling live shows super-spreader events and wondering why more artists weren't canceling shows. -- Allison Prang contributed to this article.

51,0,Whopper worries 'No power' to close BK Russia: partner,401 words,New York Post,"Kolobov said he doesn't have the ""authority or power"" to unilaterally shut down the Russian locations in response to the invasion, arguing that this 30% interest in a joint partnership with Burger King was ""far below control"" required to take action. ""The decision to terminate and suspend operations of the franchisee, which employs about 25,000 persons, must be taken by all shareholders considering the impact it may have on the employees and their families,"" Kolobov said in a statement to the BBC.  RBI holds a 15% minority stake in the venture and is selling off its business interests in Russia following the dispute. The company did not respond to a request for comment on his remarks.  RBI's Shear said the Burger King owner operates in Russia through a joint-venture partnership with Kolobov, investment firm Investment Capital Ukraine and VTB Capital, an affiliate of Russia's VTB Bank. Contradiction Kolobov's response contradicted Shear's stance in the open letter explaining Burger King's conundrum in Russia. In the lengthy statement, Shear asserted that Kolobov was ""responsible for the day-to-day operations and oversight of the ~800 restaurants in Russia."" ""We contacted the main operator of the business and demanded the suspension of Burger King restaurant operations in Russia. They have refused to do so,"" Shear said. The deal's terms meant Burger King can't shut down without Kolobov's approval or intervention from Russian authorities, who have grown increasingly hostile toward Western companies, according to Shear.  Burger King rival McDonald's shut down all of its locations in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. tbarrabi@nypost.com"

347,0,Curtin closure sparks plea for help as live music venues face collapse,858 words,The Age - Online,"The announcement prompted other live music venues and politicians to urge the state government to remove restrictions or provide cash relief for businesses that have not been propped up by governments during the Omicron wave, which caused mass cancellation of shows. Premier Daniel Andrews said the Lygon Street venue, a favoured pub for former prime minister Bob Hawke, had historical value and should continue trading. The Victorian Trades Hall Council, which represents Victorian unions, is discussing a bid to buy the property with unions, individuals and community groups. ""I'm sure that the union movement and people who have enjoyed that first-class establishment will get [around it] and maybe they can revisit the decision,"" Mr Andrews said. He said he hoped the establishment had a future, but it was out of the government's control given it was a private commercial property and ""there might be a whole lot of different things at play there"" when it came to the landlord's intention. The state government has provided $290,000 worth of support to The Curtin over the course of the pandemic. It will also announce on Thursday that 160 eligible live music venues will be able to apply for an $8 million grant program providing cash payments of between $20,000 and $65,000. The program is part of a broader $20 million scheme announced in November. ""The government has provided more than $45 million in dedicated support for the live music industry through the pandemic,"" an Andrews government spokesman said. Live music venues are subject to a density quotient of one person per two square metres. These venues are normally permitted to hold one person per 0.75 square metres - allowing many patrons to squeeze in - so the current cap effectively drops these venues down to 37.5 per cent capacity. Simone Pulga, who owns the Butterfly Club cabaret venue in the CBD, said some venues were ""weeks, not months"" from collapse. ""There's a timer on this. No business can trade at 37.5 per cent indefinitely,"" he said. ""There's a dissonance that I can go to the gym in the morning and it's at full capacity, but at night I go to work and [it's] not. There used to be a common goal and common purpose. It used to be COVID-zero in 2020, and then it was vaccination last year. Now, we don't know. It makes it very hard to plan."" Brendan Brogan is a co-owner of Brunswick music venue Howler. He spent Wednesday afternoon transforming it into a function space because there are ""no shows on the horizon"". ""All shows in January and February needed to run at 160 people rather than our usual 400, so they moved to a bigger venue. We sold all the tickets to those events and then they moved, so we made more money. ""We were fine with that for a month or so, but now all the shows for the next three months have moved to larger venues ï¿½?Bookers are calling me saying they want to book our place, but they're asking when the rules will come off, and I can't answer that. It's not a viable business model."" Federal Greens leader Adam Bandt, who represents the seat of Melbourne, said venues needed financial support from the federal or state government if COVID-19 restrictions persisted. ""Live music is the beating heart of Melbourne, but venues and artists are going under and some may not resurface,"" he said in a statement. Mr Bandt and Greens state MP for Melbourne Ellen Sandell have written to the Premier and Planning Minister Richard Wynne urging them to fund the Victorian Trades Hall Council bid to buy the pub. Simon Ambrose, chief executive of the National Trust of Australia, said he supported the push to save the Curtin, arguing ""too many pubs have been lost to the wrecking ball"". ""It's time to stop the facadism and cultural destruction that is happening across our city,"" he said. ""Victoria's planning laws leave us powerless to stop pubs and other cultural venues from being turned into apartments or office buildings."" ""While it has a heritage overlay in the Melbourne planning scheme, it is still vulnerable to redevelopment."" Opposition Leader Matthew Guy said the Curtin was ""a victim of the government's on-again-off-again lockdowns, QR codes in and out, and density"".

64,1,A Growing Tribe of 'Finfluencers' Demystifies Investing for Women,1819 words,The New York Times,"By the end of hourlong workshop, Ms. Dunlap -- who regularly reaches nearly 2.8 million followers through TikTok and Instagram -- had helped roughly 170 women invest nearly $20,000. For many, it was the first time they had ever bought a share. Talking about money, Ms. Dunlap said in an interview later, can be ''the most boring thing in the world.'' And though she cringes at the word empowerment, that's what money is about: the ability to fund causes you support, travel and spend as you like, and make -- or break -- personal relationships without consideration of the financial implications. ''It's what money can buy you,'' said Ms. Dunlap, 27, who dispenses financial tips and career advice, sometimes in T-shirts with slogans like ''Smash the Patriarchy'' or ''Financial Feminist,'' the title of a podcast starting again this month as well as a book due out in December. She eschews American tropes about bootstraps that don't work for a generation whose wages haven't kept pace with tuition bills or the cost of living, and finds common criticisms of younger Americans, like that they're struggling because they don't work hard or buy too many lattes, offensive. ''That is so insulting to the single mom who works harder than any of us but can't afford her rent,'' Ms. Dunlap said. It's an appealing message for many young people, helping make Ms. Dunlap a popular financial guru whose business grossed more than $3.4 million last year, she said, spurred on by a pandemic that has raised the popularity of investing and swelled the ranks of self-made online experts. But rather than rallying behind meme stocks or the latest hot crypto trend, she is part of a growing tribe of largely millennial women aiming to change the narrative around women and money, often by drawing from their own experiences. There's Berna Anat, a.k.a. Financial Hype Woman; Melissa Jean-Baptiste, the BeyoncÃ© of Personal Finance, also known as Millennial in Debt; Delyanne the Money Coach; and Haley Sacks, founder of Mrs. Dow Jones and Finance Is Cool. They are latter-day Suze Ormans without the latte shaming, using TikTok and podcasts instead of TV and radio to dispense practical financial guidance. With popularity comes myriad ways to monetize it, from striking book deals to running workshops. There's also the potential to secure lucrative corporate sponsorships, which caused waves nearly two decades ago when Ms. Orman appeared in a ''lock and roll'' financing ad for General Motors. Larger financial firms were long wary of social media, even as many companies embraced apps like Instagram to connect with customers. But TikTok has become a force they cannot ignore, consultants said, and firms are amplifying their presence there. State Farm, for example, skipped the splashy Super Bowl ads this year and instead created its first-ever TikTok challenge. ''I have spent so much time trying to convince clients to work on social media and embrace it,'' said Ben Cathers, a consultant who works with financial firms at Hootsuite, a social media management company. ''And now they're saying, 'OK, how do we create TikTok videos today?''' Since her first TikTok post less than two years ago, Ms. Dunlap has cultivated enough of a following -- largely women in their 20s and 30s -- to command $15,000 per video from corporate customers seeking a direct line to her audience. But her latest partnership, with an app, called Treasury, started by two others, goes further. With its beginner's workshop and portfolio-sharing tools, the app bills itself as ''a nonjudgmental investing community'' aimed at women. The goal is to help them overcome feelings common to many would-be investors who are cautious -- or even paralyzed -- by the idea of jumping into a subject they haven't mastered. Even if some women hesitate before getting started, they often gain an edge later: Research has suggested women tend to be better savers and investors than men. ''I was the friend every female friend came to,'' Ms. Dunlap said. ''And I also became more committed to managing my own money. I realized I had a passion for teaching women the same thing.'' It started, naturally, as a side hustle. In late 2016, Ms. Dunlap was working for a security firm when she started blogging. Within a couple of years, she began to focus on money and set a goal: $100,000 in savings at age 25. Readers could follow along while she tried to reach her target, which she hit in September 2019, two months after her birthday. That caught the attention of producers at ''Good Morning America,'' and by the end of the year, Ms. Dunlap had quit her job running social media at a start-up and turned her attention to her budding business of financial and career coaching. The pandemic arrived, and her company, Her First 100k, quickly built an even larger online following. Her formula: Posts should be entertaining (one of her majors was theater), educational (there she is negotiating a job offer) and aspirational (who doesn't want to write their book in an Italian villa?). But at the core is practical advice that Ms. Dunlap said grew out of responsible financial habits learned from her parents, who saved religiously and never spent mindlessly during her childhood in Tacoma, Wash. An only child, Ms. Dunlap remembers walking into the den, where she could reliably find her mother balancing the checkbook on the 13th and the 21st of each month. Her father's scripts for negotiating everything from the cable bill to parking fees at hotels lodged in her brain. ''These are the sorts of behaviors I saw,'' she said. ''I just thought that was normal.'' Ms. Dunlap's father also inspired her entrepreneurial spirit. When she was 9, he made her an offer she couldn't refuse: a three-slot candy vending machine, and a $300 loan to buy it from him. She paid it off in roughly two years. They spent one Saturday a month driving around town in his Chevy pickup, refilling her growing stable of machines. She had to buy candy in bulk -- she was initially crestfallen after learning she could have halved her expenses at Costco -- and later pitched local retailers to secure spots for the machines, again modeling her father's approaches. She drafted three-sentence contracts in Microsoft Word, and had a checkbook by the time she was 11. Profits went to her college fund -- she said graduating debt free from the University of Portland had been a major factor in her ability to save that first $100,000 -- and she owned 15 machines when she graduated from high school. At 20, she sold the turnkey business to a 10-year-old, also named Tori, for about $1,700. Treasury, which has positioned itself between D.I.Y. investing and roboadvisers that create and manage automated portfolios, is considerably more complicated than quarter-a-pop vending machines. It's akin to an investing club: Users hook their online brokerage accounts into the app, which tracks their purchases -- TD Ameritrade users can trade in the Treasury platform directly -- and allows them to see how others' portfolios (including Ms. Dunlap's) are divvied up. During the workshops, she cheers users on as they make their purchases, hopefully from a list of popular index funds. She makes it clear she's not offering professional advice -- she calls herself a financial educator -- so the process is something like investing with the encouragement of a well-informed friend. Friendly advice isn't necessarily cheap, though. The initial one-hour workshop costs $99, and users can add a $12.99 monthly subscription to get early access to roughly one workshop a month (for example, on getting started with a tax-advantaged account like a Roth I.R.A.), other events and content. By comparison, putting $500 in a popular portfolio at the roboadviser Betterment costs just $1.25 a year (0.25 percent of the money invested, plus a tad more for the underlying investments). Ellevest, a roboadviser geared toward women, charges $12 annually for its most basic investment plan, and includes extras like online workshops and email courses from certified financial planners. ''There are cheaper options, and yet so many people just don't invest, period,'' said Treasury's chief executive, Elias Rothblatt, who founded the service with Ivar Vong. He said Treasury's goal was to give users the nudge they needed to get started. ''If you put $50 or $100 into a low-cost investment and that makes you feel like, 'Oh, cool, I learned about investing,' then that is a major win,'' he said. The service, which became available to the public in January, has drawn 2,000 users who have invested nearly $13.5 million. In 2021, it helped people invest $4 million of that during its private beta testing. More seasoned investors also see the appeal: Start-up funders, led by Bloomberg Beta, have put in more than $1.25 million. Nearly 270 people took part in that February session. Ms. Dunlap started with a pep talk before diving into explanations dotted with metaphor. She likened buying shares of Amazon, for example, to ''owning a grain of sand on Bezos' beach.'' A little blue counter ticked away in the corner of the screen, tracking total dollars invested as participants made purchases, buying shares of investments like the Vanguard Total World Stock E.T.F., State Street's Global Diversity Index E.T.F. and more. More than half bought something in that hour, spending roughly $120 each -- a modest sum, but a meaningful first step.

Li, the son of Hong Kongâs richest man Li Ka-shing, has a US$900 million stake in GoTo Group. He invested in Tokopedia in 2017, one of his first major bets to grow his empire in Southeast Asia. GoTo, which mainly focuses on serving the Indonesian market, raised US$1.1 billion with shares priced at 338 rupiah (18 HK cents), making it Asiaâs largest and the worldâs fifth-largest IPO this year. GoToâs debut was stronger than those of its competitors, namely Singapore-based ride-hailing app Grab, which was listed on the Nasdaq exchange in December last year. The stock price of another competitor, New York-listed gaming and e-commerce giant Sea, also headquartered in Singapore, has also languished. Both Grab and Sea, which focus on Southeast Asia, have lost around US$71 billion combined on the markets so far this year. âListing locally, in the home market, has a benefit because the investors here understand. They walk on the street, they look out of their window, and they see a Gojek helmet. On Wall Street, [the investorsâ] only taste of the company is through an analytical report that somebody gives them,ï¿½?said Vinnie Lauria, founding partner at Southeast Asia focused-venture capital firm Golden Gate Ventures in Singapore, which is a small shareholder at GoTo. âBut I do think itâd be too soon to say this is hands down a better job for GoTo,ï¿½?said Lauria, though he added that for a local listing, GoToâs debut clearly came out ahead of Grab and Sea. He now expects GoTo to pursue a dual listing in the United States. Local retail investors ï¿½?who count themselves among the legion of GoToâs fans ï¿½?have voiced their sense of pride at buying into the future of two household names. GoToâs constituent companies started out small ï¿½?Gojek was originally a 20-fleet motorcycle taxi-booking operation in 2010. Tokopedia, which started in 2009, was co-founded by William Tanuwijaya, an Indonesian-Chinese entrepreneur with a rural background who used to work night shifts at an internet cafe to pay for his college tuition. The 40-year-old drew inspiration from the likes of Facebookâs Mark Zuckerberg and Alibabaâs Jack Ma to get his business off the ground. More than a decade on, both firms boast more than 2.5 million registered driver partners and more than 14 million merchants on their platforms, whose combined ecosystem contributed 2 per cent of Indonesiaâs US$1.1 trillion economy, according to the companyâs claims. While the e-commerce sector is led by several unicorns ï¿½?or companies valued at above US$1 billion ï¿½?Southeast Asiaâs largest digital economy still offers plenty of room for growth as online spending is expected to rise to US$146 billion in 2025, a jump from US$70 billion last year. Still, GoToâs fortunes cannot be determined by its first week. E-commerce firm Bukalapak, Indonesiaâs largest listing when it debuted last year and raised US$1.5 billion, has seen its stock fall by 60 per cent since last August. Geopolitical dynamics and global economic developments were also likely to have an impact on the stocksï¿½?movement in the near future, Li said. âBukalapak had a challenge that it was only the fourth-largest player in a highly competitive market. Grab and Sea for the last four months have been under the perfect storm of inflation, interest-rate hike and macro geopolitical uncertainties,ï¿½?Li said. GoTo is also not profitable yet and reported a net loss equivalent to US$806 million for the first nine months last year. Analysts predict that GoToâs main challenge following its IPO is to overcome investorsï¿½?scepticism about its business model. Singapore-based fintech-focused consulting firm Kapronasia said in a note last week that the âstrugglesï¿½?of super-app firms could not simply be put down to poor sentiment around the Russian invasion or high inflation. âThe problem lies in their business models, which seek to create one-size-fits-all solutions that users do not necessarily want, and that are built upon questionable foundations,ï¿½?it wrote. âHow much time do people spend in a ride-hailing and food-delivery app? Where is the link from those services to banking?ï¿½?The consultancy firm noted that Gojekâs acquisition of a small Indonesian bank, Bank Jago, in 2020 could help it become âa stronger digibanking playerï¿½?than Grab and Sea."
790,0,China suspected in hack of journalists at News Corp,534 words,Reuters News,"News Corp, which publishes the Wall Street Journal, said the breach was discovered in late January and affected emails and documents of what it described as a limited number of employees, including journalists. It said that cybersecurity firm Mandiant had contained the breach.  David Wong, vice president of consulting at Mandiant, said the hackers were believed to have ""a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests."" A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said he was unaware of the details of the reports but that he hoped ""there can be a professional, responsible and evidence-based approach to identifying cyber-related incidents, rather than making allegations based on speculations."" In a letter seen by Reuters, company executives told their employees that âwe believe the activity affected a limited number of business email accounts and documents from News Corp headquarters, News Technology Services, Dow Jones, News UK, and New York Post.ï¿½?""Our preliminary analysis indicates that foreign government involvement may be associated with this activity, and that some data was taken,"" executives said. The company added that its other business units, including HarperCollins Publishers, Move, News Corp Australia, Foxtel, REA, and Storyful, were not targeted in the attack. News Corp shares were down 1.3% in morning trading. The Wall Street Journal, which reported the news first, competes with Reuters, the news division of Thomson Reuters Corp (TRI.TO), in supplying news to media outlets. Chinese hackers have repeatedly been blamed for hacks of journalists both in the United States and elsewhere. In 2013, for example, the New York Times reported a breach which it said had affected 53 personal computers belonging to its employees. The paper said the timing of those intrusions corresponded with its investigation into the wealth accumulated by relatives of Wen Jiabao, Chinaâs then-prime minister. The report was the first in a series of contemporaneous disclosures about similar intrusions or attempted intrusions at other U.S. media organizations, including Bloomberg, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal. Beijing's hackers have been targeting Western journalists for years, said Mike McLellan, the director of intelligence at cybersecurity firm Secureworks, which has tracked China-linked spying on media organizations on-and-off over the past decade. He said journalists might have access to valuable sources of intelligence about China's adversaries or its domestic opponents. Even considered against China's reputation for aggressive cyber espionage against a range of targets - from military secrets to intellectual property - McLellan said media remained a favorite. âJournalists ï¿½?and the things they're working on ï¿½?are fairly high on their list of priorities,"" he said.

677,1,Amazon CEO Andy Jassy Pledges to Improve Worker Safety in Shareholder Letter,639 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"On employee safety, he said the companyâs injury rates were âsometimes misunderstoodï¿½?but vowed to do better. âWeâre not close to being done in how we improve the lives of our employees,ï¿½?Mr. Jassy said in the letter. He noted that the company identified âthe top 100 employee experience pain pointsï¿½?and is working to try to solve them. âWeâre also passionate about further improving safety in our fulfillment network, with a focus on reducing strains, sprains, falls, and repetitive stress injuries,ï¿½?he said. On the companyâs injury rates, he said incidents in its warehouses were slightly above Amazonâs peersï¿½?average, and slightly lower than the companyâs peersï¿½?average in the courier and delivery business. He said those numbers put the company at about average compared with its peers, but that the company wants âto be best in class.ï¿½?âWhen I first started in my new role, I spent significant time in our fulfillment centers and with our safety team, and hoped there might be a silver bullet that could change the numbers quickly,ï¿½?he added. âI didnât find that.ï¿½?Mr. Jassy took over Amazon from Mr. Bezos, the founder who is now executive chairman of the company. Mr. Bezos used to write annual shareholder letters since the company went public in 1997. The letters often highlighted the companyâs successes, usually told with a storytelling flourish. In a CNBC interview on Thursday, Mr. Jassy said he speaks to Mr. Bezos weekly. âItâs great to have a sounding board,ï¿½?he said. âHe has so much wisdom.ï¿½?Mr. Jassyâs comments about worker safety come as one of the companyâs warehouses in Staten Island, N.Y., recently voted to unionize. Amazon said in a legal filing last week it intends to appeal the loss because of actions taken by the National Labor Relations Board and the Amazon Labor Union. âItâs [the] employeesï¿½?choice whether or not they want to join a union,ï¿½?Mr. Jassy said on CNBC. âWe happen to think theyâre better off not doing so.ï¿½?He noted employees tend to perform better when they have direct connections with their managers. âIf [employees] see something they can do better for customers or for themselves, they can go meet in a room, decide how to change it and change it,ï¿½?he said on CNBC. âThat type of empowerment doesnât happen when you have unions. Itâs much more bureaucratic, itâs much slower.ï¿½?While Amazon hired more than 300,000 workers last year, Mr. Jassy said on CNBC that the company still didnât have enough people in certain locations. Mr. Jassy in his letter also addressed Amazonâs carbon footprint and said the company is making significant progress on its climate pledge to be net-zero carbon by 2040. He said Amazon is committed to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of the companyâs initial target.  Amazon reported in February that fourth-quarter earnings nearly doubled and revenue rose. Mr. Jassy at the time said the companyâs costs were higher over the holidays because of inflation and labor supply shortages.

814,1,Ceapro Inc. - Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Financial Results and Operational Highlights,1089 words,ENP Newswire,"We are thrilled with achievements made in 2021 on all fronts from production operations to research and development, allowing us to expand our pipeline to build a high value life sciences Company focused on immune and inflammation-based diseases. A 14% year over year increase in sales for our base business is absolutely remarkable especially during such a year marked by a continued COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary pressure, issues related to availability of inputs, persistently high logistical transportation costs and labour scarcity. Despite these challenges, our team worked tirelessly to meet strong demand for our products and deliver one of the best ever performances in the Company's history. I thank everyone wholeheartedly for their resilience and dedication,' stated Gilles Gagnon, M.Sc., MBA, President and CEO, of Ceapro. 'In addition to excellent financial and operational results, we had many key highlights over the course of the year and are committed to building on these achievements.' 2021 Corporate and Operational Highlights Pipeline Development Avenanthramides: Announced expanded collaboration with Montreal Heart Institute (MHI) with new clinical study evaluating flagship product, avenanthramides, as a new potential pharmaceutical product. This Phase 1 safety and tolerability study will be led by renowned Dr. Jean-Claude Tardif. Published positive results from Ceapro's previously conducted study evaluating anti-inflammatory properties of low doses of avenanthramides in exercise-induced inflammation paved the way for this clinical trial. Agreement signed with Corealis to formulate 30mg and 240mg dosage pills to be used in Phase 1 study with MHI. Completed physical characterization of avenanthramides and continued to monitor stability studies with new powder formulations. Completed the Phase 1 study protocol which expects to enroll approximately 72 patients. Oat Beta Glucan: Completed pilot clinical trial evaluating oat beta glucan in patients with high cholesterol levels. While there were positive signals that beta glucan nutraceutical formulation may offer appreciable health benefits as indicated with approved Health Canada's beta glucan monograph (Natural Product Division), the study did not achieve in a statistically significant manner the expected primary endpoint related to a decrease of low-density lipoproteins cholesterol when using Ceapro's pill dosage form. Announced research agreement with Boston-based Angiogenesis Foundation to assess in vivo bioefficacy of oat beta glucan and avenanthramides in angiogenesis, blood vessel repairs, and wounds to assess healing and tissue regeneration in various inflammation-based diseases and conditions like COVID-19 presenting damages of the lung blood vessels. Yeast Beta Glucan (YBG) Analyzed and screened YBG feedstock from numerous global suppliers to select ideal sources for best possible product. Identified process conditions for YBG improving morphology of YBG processed using PGX Technology (PGX-YBG) to boost immunomodulating activity. Further developed custom-shape formulations of PGX-YBG for oral administration. Obtained further evidence confirming that PGX-YBG is suitable for lung inhalation. Demonstrated, in vitro, that PGX processed YBG can prevent the activation of macrophages toward a pro-fibrotic phenotype which, according to experts in the field, is seen as a viable therapeutic strategy toward fibrotic disease. PGX-YBG binds to specific receptors (Dectin 1) located on macrophages responsible for the cascade of immunomodulating events when activated. McMaster's research team discovered a new mechanism of action as per PGX-YBG's ability to reprogram macrophages on its own. Continuing PGX-YBG project with McMaster University to assess preclinical animal models to determine posology. Initiated studies with a medical device manufacturer to assess aerosol/nebulizer device for inhalation of YBG. Proved, using an in vitro study, that the Company's PGX Technology maintains the integrity of the YBG molecular structure and enhances its microscopic morphology which leads to a boost in its immunomodulatory activity without generating proinflammatory reaction. Based on these attributes PGX-YBG is poised to become a key strategic asset for the Company. New Chemical Complexes / Delivery Systems: Announced the successful completion of a long-term research program conducted with University of Alberta. This screening program allowed Ceapro to retain the most promising products, such as PGX-alginate, and expand the PGX-processed products pipeline. Combination of alginate and YBG, leading to tunable PGX composites, are now viewed as the most promising products developed from this research program. Pursued bioavailability studies with University of Alberta for new chemical complexes YBG-CoQ10, alginate-CoQ10 and the newly formed alginate-YBG-CoQ10. Results are expected in Q3 2022. Technology: Continued significant technical improvements of the existing PGX plant in Edmonton to develop equipment for the production of PGX-YBG for the purpose of generating material suitable for nutraceutical and lung delivery. Ongoing engineering design in collaboration with experts in the field for designing and building a PGX processing commercial unit. Alginate and yeast beta glucan would be the first products to be processed at large scale level. Given regulatory requirements and to accelerate market entry, yeast beta glucan as a standalone and/or in combination with alginate will be developed at first as a nutraceutical/immune booster. Pursued installment in Edmonton of a commercial scale unit for loading of bioactives onto PGX-processed biopolymers. This system allows loading of active pharmaceutical ingredients, like ibuprofen, onto thin soluble PGX alginate strips for wound healing or oral applications. Continued projects with University of Alberta and McMaster University for the development of potential delivery systems for multiple applications in healthcare. About Ceapro Inc.

The facility has classified bars, pubs and nightclubs as high-risk events for coronary infections. On the other hand, according to the department, food and staff restaurants are places with a low risk of infection. Minister of Economic Affairs Mika LintilÃ¤(center) announced the start of preparations on Friday. According to the minister, the government is very united that low-risk restaurants should not be subject to further restrictions. The bar closure would not materialize immediately. - It will probably talk about a three- to four-week timeline, because then Parliament will decide the law in due course, LintilÃ¤ said. The operation of the restaurants is already heavily regulated, as all restaurants will have to close in the evening and their customer numbers will be limited. Despite THL's recommendation, a total ban on liquor restaurants alone has been considered difficult by the government. Doubts have been raised about the specification of restaurants by law. The law will be prepared in co-operation between the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. The latter has wanted to close all restaurants. The government's coronation ministerial working group met on Friday. According to LintilÃ¤, the introduction of the emergency law was not discussed at the meeting. The support pot could be over 200 million It was also reported at the event that the government is preparing a closure fee and a new round of cost subsidies for companies affected by various corona measures. The closure compensation would currently apply, for example, to sports and sports facilities that have been closed by an official decision. The cost support for companies subject to less restrictive restrictions would be the sixth in a row. There is also an event guarantee under construction that would allow for the planning of summer events. At the moment, Finland could only grant the guarantee until the end of June, but according to LintilÃ¤, the government intends to apply to the European Commission for permission to extend the guarantee until the end of September. The government is due to submit a bill on the support package to Parliament in early February. According to LintilÃ¤, the exact size of the compensation will only be decided when the duration of the various closures and restrictions is specified. He said tentatively that the total amount of aid could be between ï¿½?200 and ï¿½?250 million. Labor market support for entrepreneurs again Due to interest rate restrictions, the government will continue to exempt entrepreneurs from labor market support. Thus, labor market support can be paid to the entrepreneur again, even if the entire business does not cease. Minister of Labor Tuula Haatainen(sd.) Spoke about the matter. This has also been done in the past during the corona epidemic. We also want to eliminate the deductible at the beginning of unemployment again, said Minister of Social Affairs and Health Hanna Sarkkinen(left). Unemployment insurance normally has a deductible for the first five days, during which no daily allowance is paid. Both exemptions would be valid from January to February. The aim is to submit the government's proposals to Parliament as soon as possible, the ministers said. *** DISCLAIMER: THIS IS AN AUTOMATED TRANSLATION FROM FINNISH ***"
636,1,(PR) Numinus Wellness Inc. Reports Q2 2022 Results,2696 words,PR Newswire,"VANCOUVER, BC, April 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - Numinus Wellness Inc. (""Numinus"" or the ""Company"") (TSX: NUMI) (OTCQX: NUMIF), a mental health care company advancing innovative treatments and safe, evidence-based psychedelic-assisted therapies, today announced its fiscal quarter results for the three and six months ended February 28, 2022 (""Q2 2022""). ""Numinus' fiscal second quarter demonstrated the strength of our growing service offering and the efficiency of our operating platform, with gross margin improving to 29.1% during Q2 2022 -- compared to 6.5% in the previous quarter. Most of this improvement is due to the successful integration of the Neurology Centre of Toronto -- an acquisition we completed during just the quarter before, and the expansion of Ketamine-assisted therapy services across our clinic network,"" said Payton Nyquvest, Founder and CEO. ""We're pleased to see the momentum in our business continue to grow, despite the seasonal slowdown associated with the December holidays during the second quarter."" Mr. Nyquvest continued: ""Looking forward, our recently announced proposed acquisition of Novamind will be transformational for Numinus as we establish a strong U.S. presence with eight revenue producing clinics located in Utah and Arizona. It also provides two additional clinical research sites and a strong pipeline of clinical research business, which will significantly expand Numinus' contract research capabilities. We are very excited about the opportunities ahead as we firmly establish the Numinus brand and our comprehensive combined mental health and wellness offering in the U.S. Collectively, our combined business will become a leading integrated mental healthcare company providing psychedelic-assisted therapies across North America, generating more revenue than any of our peers."" Second Quarter Financial Highlights -- Revenues grew 240% year-over-year to $0.8 million in Q2 2022, due primarily to the acquisitions of Mindspace and the Neurology Centre of Toronto. Sequentially, revenues were in line with the prior quarter, representing periods of increased client appointments alongside the seasonally slower period over December holidays. -- Gross margin grew significantly to 29.1% during Q2 2022, compared to 6.5% in Q1 2022 and -25.7% in Q2 2021. The marked improvement in gross margin is due mostly to a greater proportion of higher margin services being booked across Numinus' wellness clinics. Gross margin improvement was most notable in the two wellness clinic businesses acquired in the last 12 months: Mindspace and the Neurology Centre of Toronto. -- Gross profit of $228,759 in Q2 2022, a 349% increase compared to gross profit compared to Q1 2022, and a significant improvement compared to the gross loss of $59,724 in Q2 2021. -- Loss was $7.8 million for Q2 2022, compared to a loss of $4.2 million in Q2 2021. -- Cash balance of $48.3 million as of February 28, 2022.

On a same-store basis, excluding NCT (the acquisition of which completed partway through Q1 2022), client appointments declined 11% compared to Q1 2022. -- As of April 14, 2022, Numinus has five wellness clinics offering services to clients (one in Vancouver, one in Toronto, and three in Montreal) that have a total of 21 treatment rooms. In addition, the Company has two dedicated research clinics where psychedelic studies are being conducted (one in Vancouver and one in Montreal). -- Numinus is pleased to announce that it will be opening a new flagship wellness clinic location in Vancouver, Canada, during the late summer or early fall of 2022. Clinical Trials -- On January 19, 2022, Numinus announced that it had received approvals from Health Canada and the Institutional Review Board to proceed with its clinical trial study for MAPS-sponsored MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD clinical trial study (""MAPPUSX""). Enrollment for the trial is open to eligible participants who were previously enrolled in the placebo arm of the parent study (""MAPP1"") or who were not able to receive treatment due to COVID-19 restrictions. -- On March 30, 2022, the Company announced that it has advanced to the implementation phase of the MAPPUSX trial, by enrolling and dosing the first clinical trial volunteer in Canada. -- Numinus Bioscience has discovered an additional drug product candidate, NBIO-03, that is nearing the final stages of development. The Company now intends to include NBIO-03 in the Phase 1 clinical trial alongside NBIO-01 to establish a maximum tolerated dose. As a result of this new opportunity, Numinus will resubmit its clinical trial application to Health Canada in the next several months to reflect the redefined scope of this study. Numinus Bioscience -- Laboratory Operations -- Q2 2022 revenue of $105,966, a 26% sequential decrease from Q1 2022, but a 19% increase from $89,059 in Q2 2021. During Q2 2022 product shipping challenges impacted the timing of analytical testing services performed for third party clients, which affected the timing of revenue recognition. The Company expects some services intended to be performed during Q2 2022 will now be completed in Q3 2022. -- During Q2 2022, Numinus Bioscience secured several additional strains of psychedelic mushroom species and has already begun genomic analysis of these spore prints for research purposes. -- On February 1, 2022, Numinus announced that it had added three key advisors to its new Bioscience Advisory Board: Graham Pechenik (JD) -- Patent Attorney & Founder, Calyx Law, Dr. Paul Spagnuolo (PhD) -- Associate Professor, University of Guelph, and Dr. Cory Harris (PhD) -- Associate Professor, University of Ottawa. -- On March 9, 2022, the Company announced hat it has received approval from Health Canada to study Ayahuasca and San Pedro. -- On March 14, 2022, Numinus Bioscience announced it was approved for a Containment Level 2 (""CL2"") license by the Public Health Agency of Canada. With the license, Numinus Bioscience will begin: -- The study of pathogens and bacterial, fungal and microbial contaminants to identify baseline markers and optimal growth environments for Psilocybe mushrooms; -- Bioassay studies using mammalian cell lines, to analyze the bioactivity of different whole mushroom formulations that contain both psilocybin and other psychedelic compounds; and -- Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pre-clinical studies using analysis of blood and other bodily fluids, to investigate reactions in the human body to whole mushrooms and other natural formulations. -- As a result of the pending proposed acquisition of Novamind and the two additional clinic research facilities the Company will gain as a result of this expansion, Numinus Bioscience has decided to halt its planned research facility expansion in Nanaimo, B.C. The Company believes diversifying its research capabilities across both Canada and the U.S. will better serve Numinus' contract research clients and long-term strategy.

748,0,Hackers got user data from Meta with forged request,408 words,Agence France Presse,"Criminal hackers have been compromising email accounts or websites tied to police or government and claiming they can't wait for a judge's order for information because it's an ""urgent matter of life and death,"" cyber expert Brian Krebs wrote Tuesday.  Bloomberg news agency, which originally reported Meta being targeted, also reported that Apple had provided customer data in response to forged data requests.  Apple and Meta did not officially confirm the incidents, but provided statements citing their policies in handling information demands. When US law enforcement officials want data on a social media account's owner or an associated cell phone number, they must submit an official court-ordered warrant or subpoena, Krebs wrote. But in urgent cases authorities can make an ""emergency data request,"" which ""largely bypasses any official review and does not require the requestor to supply any court-approved documents,"" he added.  Meta, in a statement, said the firm reviews every data request for ""legal sufficiency"" and uses ""advanced systems and processes"" to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse. ""We block known compromised accounts from making requests and work with law enforcement to respond to incidents involving suspected fraudulent requests, as we have done in this case,"" the statement added.  Apple noted its guidelines, which say that in the case of an emergency application ""a supervisor for the government or law enforcement agent who submitted the... request may be contacted and asked to confirm to Apple that the emergency request was legitimate."" Krebs noted that the lack of a unitary, national system for these type of requests is one of the key problems associated with them, as companies end up deciding how to deal with them. ""To make matters more complicated, there are tens of thousands of police jurisdictions around the world - including roughly 18,000 in the United States alone - and all it takes for hackers to succeed is illicit access to a single police email account,"" he wrote. gc-jm/bfm"

The London-listed food-delivery company forecasts gross transaction value growth in a range of 15%-25% for 2022, and the U.K. investment group says this comes with downside risk considering food price inflation and the fact that like-for-like basket prices through delivery apps tend to come with higher prices before delivery fees. Deliveroo's 1Q GTV growth was strong against a tough year-earlier comparator, Shore Capital says, noting that the new grocery rollout did the heavy lifting. Shore cautions on a normalization in appetite for restaurant delivery, referencing Tortilla's recent earnings. Deliveroo shares are up 2.4% at 109.00 pence.

6,1,ICICI Pru Life net jumps over 2-fold to Rs 185 cr in Jan-Mar,460 words,Press Trust of India,"For the full year 2021-22, the company's net profit declined to Rs 754 crore from Rs 960 crore for the year ended in March 2021, it said. Value of new business (VNB) for FY2022 was Rs 2,163 crore, a growth of 33.4 per cent over FY2021. This was led by a robust growth of 25 per cent in new business sum assured and 20 per cent in Annualised Premium Equivalent for the same period, the company said. VNB is used to measure profitability of the new business written in a period. It is present value of all future profits to shareholders at the time of writing of the new business contract. It is also referred to a new business profit (NBP). The company has a well-diversified product mix with linked savings at 48 per cent, traditional savings at 31 per cent, protection at 17 per cent and the balance of 4 per cent accounted for by group savings products, it said. The board has approved a final dividend of Rs 0.55 per equity share for FY2022, said the insurer. The company's 13th month persistency ratio improved to 85.7 per cent for FY2022, up from 84.8 per cent for FY2021, indicative of the quality of business being underwritten, it added. Despite concerns and challenges posed by the onset of the Omicron variant, company's robust technology backbone has enabled continuity in operations, be it onboarding new customers or delivering superior service.

In March, we posted the best ever monthly sales by the company in any year since inception. This helped grow our VNB by 33 per cent year-on-year to Rs 2,163 crore for FY2022 with a robust VNB mrgin of 28 per cent."" Further, the insurer said that the strong performance was driven in equal measure by over 100 valuable partnerships forged during the year.

122,1,DATA SHOWING MORE WORKERS,401 words,The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal,"The Department of Workforce Development reported Thursday that Wisconsin's unemployment rate for March dropped to 2.8%, according to preliminary estimates. DWD will update the state's official unemployment rate for March next month, while February's finalized rate came in at 2.9% - tied for the all-time low. Officials also noted that the state had a record 3,056,200 people employed last month, according to preliminary data, which also underscores a strong overall economy. The news comes while many industries in the state continue to struggle with ongoing workforce shortage challenges. ""We've heard of the Great Resignation, but that is somewhat turning around,"" DWD chief economist Dennis Winters said during a press briefing Thursday. ""We're getting a little bit of data in where the older workers, the baby boomers essentially, are coming back into the workforce. The causes of that are uncertain."" Winters added that time will tell whether that workforce trend will continue. ""That will be a big determinant in the overall labor force participation rate, which will then be a big determinant in how critical the job quantities are,"" he said. State officials said March's preliminary unemployment rate of 2.8% marks a record for the state, though previous estimates have reached that level as recently as December 2021, though that month's rate was later revised to 3.1%. The state's finalized unemployment rate reached as low as 2.9% in February of this year, March 2020 and the months of January, February and March 2018. Despite the positive growth, Winters said ongoing labor force challenges continue to put a damper on the economic growth in not just Wisconsin, but in national and global markets as well. We just don't have the personnel,"" he said. ""That's why technology and training matched together is critical to bring it together to increase that productivity going forward so the economies can grow and the standard of living can grow.

Suedzucker said it expects âsignificantly higherï¿½?operating profit in the first quarter of its new financial year starting on March 1 against the 49 million euros in last yearâs first quarter. ""The forecast for the first quarter and the full year is based on the assumption that the Ukraine war will remain temporary and regionally limited, that the physical supply of energy and raw materials is guaranteed,"" Suedzucker said. ""Suedzucker's expected transfer of the significantly higher prices, especially in the raw material and energy sectors, into new customer contracts will be of decisive importance."" Raw sugar futures rose to the highest level in nearly five months on Wednesday, boosted by stronger energy prices and a slow start to the cane harvest in Centre-South Brazil. A Suedzucker spokesman declined further comment on the reasons behind the positive outlook given on Thursday.  Suedzucker unit CropEnergies, which produces the green fuel bioethanol, also gave an optimistic outlook for its new year on Thursday.

Massive Restaurants aims to have 100 points of sales for its cloud kitchen format by the end of this calender year, up from 14 currently. It has been working on its Pizza brand Slyce for the past two years and will launch it in mid March. It will also launch a biryani brand by the end of March. Both brands will be delivery only. Rahul Singh, founder and CEO of the Beer CafÃ© said the weekend business has been very good, but the industry is still operating at 50% capacity and the night curfew that is still on in states such as Delhi is 'devoid of any logic.'âThe virus has nothing to do with timings. States should look at Bengaluru that has done away with these curbs,"" he added.

It will launch a new Copper Chimney outlet in Delhi this month besides new outlets for Joshh, its new Indian QSR format. ""We will also have various food courts opening up in corporate parks etc. We are back in expansion mode and have seen a very fast bounce back this time. Rents have come down and consumers are looking to step out now. The home deliveries continue to be promising.

We opened two new outlets for our Bougie and Miso Sexy brands in Delhi recently and will open another outlet for a Japanese food brand this month. We also have something coming up in Bengaluru and another seven to eight outlets in the pipeline. Our major concern is ongoing curbs such as night curfews in Delhi.

While each company had to consider its own financial situation, McDonald's was the first major voice in the industry to take a stand. The giant burger chain occupies a ""pre-eminent place"" in fast food, essentially paving the way for every other chain to follow its lead, president and CEO of Kalinowski Equity Research Mark Kalinowski told Insider.  McDonald's ""made the decision for other companies that much easier,"" he told Insider. McDonald's has nearly 850 locations in Russia, and combined Russian and Ukrainian locations make up about 9% of revenue and 3% of operating income, the company said. CFO Kevin Ozan told CNBC that the closures will cost McDonald's about $50 million a month [https://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-say-russia-closures-will-cost-50-million-per-month-2022-3?inline-endstory-related-recommendations=]. Once McDonald's made a public decision, fast food competitors could make their own calculations. ""If McDonald's is going to take a hit on operating profits for a while"" on its relatively large Russian presence, other chains whose bottom lines would be less impacted can make that decision with less risk, Kalinowski said. ""From a PR perspective, it makes sense,"" he told Insider. The industry's in-step response to following McDonald's lead shows that for all the changes in fast food in recent decades, McDonald's is still the biggest decision-maker. Other chains tend to defer to McDonald's , Kalinowski said.  McDonald's is often the first chain to make moves that are eventually adopted by others in the industry.

The IOC and host nation Japan are still confident that the Games will go ahead as planned, but no one has any real idea on how long this might go on for. Just from athletes I have spoken to, there is definitely real concern over the Games. The concern isnât just over whether the games get cancelled or not. For each individual athlete, it is also over their own preparations. As an athlete, getting sick is never great and if you got this virus bad you might face missing weeks of training. It could result on you missing the podium in Tokyo.? Or missing the Games altogether. Another friend of mine told me of his concerns that if they move the Games then he might not even get selected.? With markets crashing and supermarket shelves being cleared, these are definitely interesting times for everybody. But when you are living during this Covid-19 pandemic with a spinal-cord injury I guess it becomes even more daunting ï¿½?as such an injury can remove your cough and sneeze reflex. With very little core function, the thought of not being able to cough is a pretty scary proposition.? This might not sound too bad. But this virus hits elderly people hard ï¿½?and this also includes your biological age due to underlying medical conditions. So this is a scary time, and I completely feel for everyone in the same boat as me how scary this is.?I remember back to catching the flu in November last year ï¿½?I thought I was going to stop breathing. I couldnât cough to clear my lungs as the level of my injury is right at the nerves which go to the lungs.? It knocked me out for weeks, so I would be lying if I said I wasnât slightly scared of Covid-19 and its possible effects on my lungs.? I am a very optimistic person who always looks for solutions over problems. But I must admit this has got me a little bit shaken.? Watching whatâs happening in Italy has been hard to believe ï¿½?particularly as life seemed to be continuing almost as normal here.? I looked at the MRI of a 44-year-old manâs lungs and it was unbelievable, unfortunately he didnât survive.? So I am staying positive but also taking advice from Austrian neurologist Viktor Frankl.?He speaks of acceptance of your current situation. These are his own words ï¿½?which I have had on my wall for the last four years: âThe meaning of life lies in finding a purpose and taking responsibility for ourselves and other human beings.ï¿½? In other words, by having a clear âwhyï¿½?we can face all the âhowï¿½?questions of life. This has got me through all those hours in hospital and continues to serve me daily.? Thereâs a reason that in-flight safety presentations always instruct us to secure our own oxygen masks before assisting fellow passengers. We canât help others effectively unless we first protect ourselves. So I spoke with a medical oncologist friend and they advised me to self-isolate.? I am now on day four and thinking this could be a long road ahead; thankfully the weather is getting warmer and I got out on my bike for a few laps of Richmond Park. Along with indoor turbo sessions I am well prepared mentally for the process. I guess all my time in hospital equipped my mind to deal with self-isolating. It also probably helps being an introvert.? I canât help but think of the poor people undergoing their cancer treatment right now though, as I prepare for my own hospital appointment in a few weeks, but I am grateful that side of things is under control. My main goal is keeping my immune system strong because another issue I have from my spinal-cord injury is a compromised immune system, thus moving me into a vulnerable group.? Itâs hard to go from a strong athlete to now feeling so vulnerable, but thankfully I have a strong mind."
543,0,CNY dining-in crunch as restaurants face strong demand but curbed capacity,574 words,Business Times Singapore,"For Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant in Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel, CNY eve bookings reflected a 25 per cent increase in diners as compared with last year, according to hotel manager Alvin Lim. On Jan 5, the multi-ministry taskforce on Covid-19 announced that the current set of safe management rules were unlikely to be relaxed before the CNY period, in light of the Omicron variant that threatened a new wave of infections. This was a noticeable change from CNY last year, when Singapore was in Phase 3 of its reopening. Groups of up to 8 were allowed to dine together then, as opposed to the current limit of 5. The dining restrictions meant a smaller seating capacity this year, even as demand has not shrunk. According to chief executive of White Restaurant, Alan Wah, current restrictions limit the seating capacity of his restaurants to 70 per cent of pre-pandemic capacity. To accommodate the demand for reservations, restaurants have found ways to increase dine-in capacity. For instance, hotels such as Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel and Conrad Centennial are repurposing their function rooms to accommodate more guests for their restaurants while adhering to government guidelines. ""This year, we have identified our Presidential Suite as another option for private dining,"" said Mew Yan Ping, director of marketing and communications at Conrad Centennial. For takeaways, restaurants generally reported an increase in orders from their set menu and corporate giftings, compared with last year. The 5-person cap on dining-out group sizes could be another reason why more people are turning to takeaway options instead of going to restaurants. ""It's not so easy for families to gather this year,"" said Samuel Yik, managing director of Dian Xiao Er. He added that festive corporate lunches are also slow due to the dine-in cap. Leveraging on the popularity of takeaway options, restaurants are using the opportunity to expand their takeaway catalogue to cater to different tastes. ""It was a conscious decision to increase our variety of Lunar New Year a la carte takeaway delicacies as we do see a higher demand for takeaways based on Christmas and New Year's Eve,"" said Lim. Yet the dining-in business is still what restaurants prize most. At Dian Xiao Er, for instance, takeaway orders have generally increased - but the restaurant will prioritise dine-in orders over takeaways, even to the extent of rejecting takeaway orders upon reaching their quota. Yik said that takeaways are not as profitable for the business, citing commission fees of delivery platforms and loss of revenue from dine-in service charge. Affirming the drawbacks on delivery takeaways, Wah said that White Restaurant will be prioritising dining in and takeaway pickups for the eve of CNY. ""Due to past experience where there was a shortage of riders during festive peak, we will not be opening up our delivery channels to avoid disappointing our customers."""

""Infringement of U.S. copyrights is a big problem in our economy,"" U.S. District Judge Richard Berman said. ""It's doubly troubling that it can be conducted ... from outside the U.S."" The Manhattan judge said Bridi played an ""important supervisory role"" in the piracy scheme. In addition to imposing the 22-month prison term, Berman ordered the defendant to pay $120,000 in restitution. Sparks allegedly cost studios tens of millions of dollars over nearly a decade by leaking movies and TV shows before their scheduled release dates. Prosecutors said the group concocted bogus reasons to obtain early copies of copyrighted DVDs and Blu-Ray discs from wholesale distributors. Sparks then used computers to override the discs' copyright protections, known as ""cracking"" or ""ripping,"" and recoded the discs with such names as ""Drones,"" ""Rovers,"" ""Geckos"" and ""Sprinter"" so they could be shared online, prosecutors said. Before being sentenced, Bridi said he had gone down the ""wrong path,"" and that his actions hurt studios and employees. ""I am deeply remorseful,"" Bridi said. ""I'm really sorry for what I've done."" Prosecutors had sought a 27- to 33-month prison term, mirroring federal sentencing recommendations. Bridi's lawyer sought his client's release, saying he had spent enough time behind bars and wanted to reunite with his wife and twin teenage sons. The defendant was born and raised in Ghana, and in 2012 moved to England, where he lived on the Isle of Wight. He was arrested in August 2020 and extradited a year later. Two other defendants have also been charged in the case. Jonatan Correa, pleaded guilty to a copyright infringement conspiracy charge and was sentenced last May to 2-1/4 years of supervised release, while Umar Ahmad of Norway is at large.

488,1,Excelerate IPO makes $384M; LNG stocks climb as export project expectations rise,389 words,SNL Financial Extra,"US LNG stocks climb as Ukraine conflict fuels expectations of export build-out The investment firm SL Advisors LLC felt bullish about U.S. LNG projects headed into 2022, as global gas prices hovered around record levels and existing U.S. export facilities ran at full bore. SL Advisors, which focuses on midstream energy investments, reasoned that a tightening global gas market bolstered the prospects of U.S. LNG projects like NextDecade Corp.'s Rio Grande LNG in Texas securing the long-term contracts required to finance their projects, with not much LNG supply scheduled to come online by mid-decade, according to Henry Hoffman, a partner at the investment firm. US EIA hikes gas price forecasts due to high LNG exports, slower solar additions The U.S. Energy Information Administration raised its forecast Henry Hub natural gas spot prices, partly because it expects exports to Europe will increase due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

NextDecade seeks permit extension for Rio Grande LNG  NextDecade asked for a two-year permit extension to build its proposed Rio Grande LNG export terminal in Texas, telling the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that it is on track to commercially sanction the project in the second half.

665,0,Is Meta in decline?,791 words,The Toronto Star,"But a recent story was different. It was about Meta's record single-day loss of more than $250 billion (U.S.) in market value. This was attributed mainly to a drop in Facebook user numbers, the result of their ongoing struggle to attract younger users away from fresher and more relevant competitors, like TikTok and Roblox. These and many other factors are coalescing to contribute to Meta's slow decline. Meta's big bet is on the metaverse. In the metaverse, people wearing AR/VR headsets or goggles interact via avatars with three-dimensional objects in virtual reality. Like social media, it is a space where sociality and commerce mix, but it is a more embodied experience of the internet. Someday it may be as much a part of our lives as social media is today, and Meta's payoff will come if it is one day welcoming billions of people into this vast and evolving virtual space. Meta aspires to dominate the metaverse as it has social media and it is investing tens of billions of dollars in acquiring companies, hiring people, and developing technologies to do so. But its success is far from guaranteed. Competitors, such as Microsoft and Sony, are in the race to develop its own technologies to challenge Meta. In addition, the metaverse that has been built so far remains underdeveloped. The user experience is limited where clunky, often legless avatars engage in a restricted set of actions. There remains a long way to go. Another challenge for Meta comes through a shift in regulatory focus. In some places it is already underway and causing headaches for Meta. For instance, recent European Union legislation now prohibits the transfer of EU users' Facebook and Instagram data to the U.S. It is proving such a challenge that Meta has recently threatened to pull Facebook and Instagram from the EU. While the EU's data protection laws are more stringent than most, theirs may be a lead that others follow. For years Meta, mainly though Facebook and Instagram, could operate with no effective regulatory oversight curbing its ambitions. It is in a class of company, with Google another prominent example, called ""surveillance capitalists,"" that thrive by knowing, using, and monetizing the data on our human experiences. Regulators missed the boat to properly regulate surveillance capitalists at their inception as they failed to foresee the significant social and economic changes these new technologies had set in motion. Few could conceive of how people could generate such valuable data and how companies would exploit this. But power is changing. Some regulators are finally beginning to get to grips with social media. They are also keenly aware of the potential threats the metaverse poses, both in terms of companies gaining monopoly powers and in protecting the integrity and safety of people's data. It is increasingly difficult for Meta to set the terms of engagement for social media, and it might become even more difficult in the metaverse. Meta's decline will be hastened by the growth of new competitors, many that could emerge from behind ""The Great Firewall of China,"" that cannot simply be acquired. Meta and other non-Chinese tech brands cannot operate in the world's largest market. Behind this ""wall"" new technologies and companies are being developed and may advance to threaten Meta. We have already seen the impact that TikTok has had on Facebook and Instagram, and others will follow. A final challenge for Meta is the move to Web 3.0. The participative social web of today is called Web 2.0. We access it primarily on mobile devices and it is dominated by a concentrated set of companies, including Meta. Web 3.0 is a more decentralized internet. It is based on blockchain and cryptocurrency and aims to move power away from a concentration of central players. Web 3.0 might eventually allow individuals to have more control over their data and digital identities, which will pose a challenge to surveillance capitalists like Meta, which is built on acquiring and monetizing such data. With these many challenges, it will be interesting to see if the masters of Web 2.0 can maintain their preeminence in its next iterations.

952,0,Australian woman attempts to contract Covid so it doesn't spoil wedding: Report,419 words,Hindustan Times,"Yes, you read it right. According to some Australia publications, Maddy Smart has posted a video on TikTok where she is seen hugging men and women at a nightclub in Melbourne in attempt to catch the virus, which she believes will prevent it from crashing the occasion. In the 15-second video titled ""Catch COVID not feelings,"" Smart is also seen swapping drinks. ""POV your wedding is in 6 weeks and you still haven't had COVID,"" she said in the accompanying caption, as reported by New York Post. While TikTok is banned in India, it is available in many other countries across the world. The video was posted just before the government in Australia's Victoria, Melbourne's state, announced that it will be closing all indoor dance floors for everyone, except wedding parties, from January 12 due to Omicron surge. The post generated mixed reactions from users on TikTok - some of them praised the woman's novel approach, while others said they are ""confused"" by the so-called preventive measure, reported New York Post. Although aggressive lockdowns and tough border controls kept a lid on infections earlier in the pandemic, Australia is now battling record Covid-29 infections. The number of infections has crossed the 1 million-mark, more than half of which have come in the past week alone, throwing a strain on hospitals and supply chains. Growing hospital admissions have forced officials to restore curbs in some states, as businesses grapple with shortages of staff because of sickness or isolation requirements. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday that Australia must ""push through"" the fast-moving Omicron outbreak, planning changes to isolation rules to allow work in food production and distribution by those who have been in close contact with asymptomatic infections.

821,0,"US star Joe Rogan, podcaster in eye of misinformation storm",727 words,Agence France Presse,"But he also has many detractors, starting with luminaries Young and Mitchell, who removed their music from Spotify in protest at its hosting of Rogan's podcast. He has spread disinformation about the coronavirus and other topics on the air. Both musicians said the false claims, and Spotify's failure to do anything about them, was the reason for their decision. R&B singer India Arie followed suit, citing what she said were Rogan's ""problematic"" comments on race. For his accusers, he is particularly dangerous because his show ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" which has been broadcast exclusively on Spotify since 2020 under a deal worth an estimated $100 million, attracts a staggering 11 million listeners per episode on average. Often with a glass of whiskey in hand, he chats casually for two to three hours with a guest on topics as varied as flying saucers, psychedelic drugs, red meat and fitness, slipping in an expletive here and there. Rogan, with a tongue as sharp as his arms are tattooed, was already famous when he began the program in 2009. A comedian and martial arts commentator known for tight T-shirts and what critics have branded his ""toxic masculinity,"" in the 1990s he was a TV actor on sitcoms including NBC's ""NewsRadio."" Later he hosted the popular reality show ""Fear Factor."" When he launched the podcast, his ratings quickly took off. People from all walks of life asked to come on. In 12 years, he has hosted nearly 1,000 guests -- 88 percent of them male, according to the fan site JRELibrary. They include Tesla boss Elon Musk, who smoked a joint on his set, whistleblower Edward Snowden and film director Oliver Stone. But Rogan has also given voice to climate sceptics, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and, since the start of the pandemic, figures in the anti-vaccine movement, earning him the label of ""a veritable megaphone of right-wing lies"" by progressive website Media Matters for America. Posing as a critic of political correctness, he has attacked the left for demonising conservatives and flirted with unfounded theories held dear by former president Donald Trump's supporters -- notably about the presence of undercover FBI agents among the US Capitol attackers on January 6 2021. Like the former Republican president, he hates ""losers."" ""I grew up around a lot of losers and one of them was my dad,"" a former police officer who was violent and who left his family, Rogan said in an interview in 2016. ""There was a lot of desire to not be like that guy and not be like all of these people around me who had no hope and no future."" Yet he defends himself against accusations of being an ideologue or of voting exclusively on the right. An atheist who supports gay marriage, the decriminalization of soft drugs, and the preservation of gun rights, he calls himself a libertarian and said he even considered supporting self-described socialist Senator Bernie Sanders in the last Democratic primary. As for his guests, ""I'm interested in having interesting conversations with people that have differing opinions. I'm not interested in only talking to people that have one perspective,"" he said in a video posted on Instagram after Young's criticism that seemingly conflated misinformation with opinions. ""I'm not trying to promote misinformation,"" he continued. ""I will do my best to try to balance out these more controversial viewpoints with other people's perspectives."" He said he agreed with Spotify's announcement in response to Young and Mitchell that Covid podcasts would include links to factual and scientifically sourced information. In a perhaps telling comment for someone who was already famous before launching his podcast, he admitted he had not been ready for the ""strange"" responsibility of having ""this many viewers and listeners."" ""It's nothing that I prepared for, and it's nothing that I ever anticipated."" chp/vgr/st/mlm"
831,1,EQS-Adhoc: ???????SÃ¼dzucker expects significant earnings increase in the first,723 words,AWP Original Press Releases,"DGAP-Ad-hoc: SÃ¼dzucker AG / Key word(s): Quarter Results/Forecast ???????SÃ¼dzucker expects significant earnings increase in the first quarter of the current 2022/23 financial year 14-Apr-2022 / 14:05 CET/CEST Disclosure of an inside information acc. to Article 17 MAR of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, transmitted by DGAP - a service of EQS Group AG. The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. ------------------------------------------------------------ Positive initial outlook for full fiscal 2022/23 despite Ukraine war After a very positive start to fiscal 2022/23, SÃ¼dzucker AG expects EBITDA and operating result for the first quarter of fiscal 2022/23 (1 March to 31 May 2022) to be significantly higher than last year's levels (Q1 2021/22: EBITDA: EUR 121 million; operating result: EUR 49 million). For fiscal 2022/23 as a whole, SÃ¼dzucker expects group revenues of EUR 8.7 to 9.1 (2021/22 year: 7.6) billion. We see EBITDA in a range of EUR 660 to 760 (2021/22: 692) million and consolidated operating result in a range of EUR 300 to 400 (2021/22: 332) million. The war in Ukraine, which has been ongoing since the beginning of the 2022/23 financial year, has further intensified the already high volatility on the sales markets and price increases on the procurement markets. The resulting economic and financial impact and the duration of this temporary exceptional situation, in addition to the Corona pandemic, are difficult to assess. In addition, the risks associated with the Corona pandemic continue to exist. The forecast for the first quarter and the full year is based on the assumption that the Ukraine war will remain temporary and regionally limited, that the physical supply of energy and raw materials is guaranteed and that the sales and procurement markets will partially normalize during fiscal 2022/23. In this context, SÃ¼dzucker's expected transfer of the significantly higher prices, especially in the raw material and energy sectors, into new customer contracts will be of decisive importance. The annual report for fiscal 2021/22 - including detailed forecast for fiscal 2022/23 - will be published on 19 May 2022, and the quarterly report for the first quarter of fiscal 2022/23 on 7 July 2022.

726,1,Dropped Catch: Why Wesfarmers' online marketplace is struggling,848 words,WAToday.com.au,"Three years and one pandemic later, Catch's growth story is looking more like a saga. Since its purchase, the business reported an inaugural full-year profit of just $1 million in 2020, before posting a $46 million loss in 2021 and a $44 million loss in the first half of fiscal 2022. And though the business' revenue started strong, in the last half it fell by 4.3 per cent. Last week, Wesfarmers announced Catch's managing director - former Amazon executive Pete Sauerborn - would depart and the business would be moved out of its Kmart division into a new data and digital arm called OneDigital. From the outside, it appears Wesfarmers is moving to restructure and hopefully stem its losses at Catch. But a key question remains: why, during a period when online shopping has seen rampant growth, is a business like Catch struggling at all? The answer, according to some familiar with the business before Wesfarmers' purchase, is an erosion of the very start-up culture lauded by Scott. Like many start-ups, Catch was tightly focused on costs and ran as a very lean business - a stance inherently at odd with a heavily corporatised, governance-focused conglomerate such as Wesfarmers. Following the purchase, a steady stream of new managers and consultants were brought in to help run the business and manage its new requirements as an entity of one of Australia's largest listed businesses. These new hires, all on respectable salaries, rapidly increased Catch's headcount and its costs, eating away at the business' bottom line. It was also, reportedly, difficult to get Wesfarmers' different divisions - the operations of which are famously kept very separate to each other - to come to the table to discuss how Catch could benefit the broader group, something that the conglomerate may now have acknowledged with the move to put Catch under OneDigital. Ben Gilbert, a veteran retail analyst with investment bank Jarden, told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald he believes one of the main challenges for Catch was pivoting the business away from its âdeal-of-the-day' focus and toward Wesfarmers' goal of it being an all-around marketplace, which could sit hand-in-hand with its similarly placed Kmart and Target department stores. ""If you look at the key ingredients for a successful marketplace, both here and offshore, its range, its price, and its delivery,"" Gilbert says. ""Catch's challenge is that it hasn't been able to push its range quite as aggressively as it's needed to, so it hasn't been front of mind in consumers' heads when they go to buy their next widget."" Gilbert also notes Wesfarmers has spent a significant amount of money on online marketing for Catch in an attempt to better scale the business, which so far hasn't translated into revenue or profit growth. And alongside the operational challenges lies the broader issue of competition. With the online retail space heating up during COVID, competitors such as Kogan, eBay and Amazon have all gained ground, each fighting for customer attention and their dollars, stunting Catch's growth efforts. Gilbert backs the company's choice to move Catch out of the Kmart Group and into the data and digital division, saying it opens the door for Catch to better leverage the strength of the rest of Wesfarmers' retail brands and potentially position the business to act as the overarching online marketplace selling goods from all of the conglomerate's flagship brands. ""Wesfarmers arguably needs a marketplace that sits above all of its brands, where it can still maintain brand integrity with a Bunnings store, a Priceline store, etcetera,"" he says. ""This move shows they're thinking now about a more of a holistic approach and how they're going to leverage the power of those brands."" ""I think that's the natural evolution for Catch."" From Wesfarmers' perspective, while Catch may have underperformed in recent years, the acquisition has been a slam dunk from a valuation perspective, with the online marketplace estimated by some analysts to be worth as much as $2 billion thanks to COVID's online shopping boom. Next week, the company will also open its first Catch fulfilment centre in NSW in an effort to meet growing customer demand. But Wesfarmers can expect to face questions about Catch at its upcoming strategy day in June, with analysts keen to know if the business has dropped the ball, or if it's just a fumble.

563,0,"Dine-in ban in Delhi affects Gurgaon and Noida restos, NCR home deliveries down by 30%",894 words,The Times of India,"The reasons are restrictions on dining hours in Gurgaon and Noida and weekend curfew ï¿½?most people would drive down from Delhi to neighbouring cities on weekends for dining and that is not happening now. It is a very disappointing situation,ï¿½?says restaurateur and Noida chapter head of National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) Varun Khera, who has outlets in both Delhi and Noida.'Almost 30% fall in delivery numbers across NCRâIn the pandemic, whenever restaurants were closed for dine-in and were only offering takeaways and home deliveries, the number of orders were usually sufficient for businesses to stay afloat and run their kitchens with skeletal staff. But in the last one week, even the delivery orders have seen a huge slump, which is worrying restaurateurs. âWe donât know what the reason is for the low number of delivery orders this time, but there has been a sharp decline. Just delivery and takeaway wonât help us sustain businesses in the long run, so we are just hoping that restrictions are lifted soon,ï¿½?says restaurateur Saurabh Khanijo. Varun Khera adds that there has been âalmost 30% decline in the number of food delivery orders from December last week till now.ï¿½?Restaurateur Vikrant Batra adds, âI am doing delivery service from some of my outlets only to minimize losses. It is not possible to keep the kitchen running at all outlets and incur costs when delivery numbers are not very high across NCR. Also, if we keep all outlets open for delivery and do not get enough orders, we have a lot of perishables and that adds to our losses.ï¿½?No dine-in and weekend curfew in Delhi is affecting Gurgaon and Noida footfall tooâIn Delhi, many restaurants do not do takeaways or delivery and have decided to remain completely shut amid dine-in restrictions. But in Gurgaon, where restaurants are allowed to be open for dining-in with time and capacity restrictions, several restaurants have temporarily shut down due to lack of customers. âI know of so many outlets at Gurgaon hubs like Sector 29 that have decided to remain shut temporarily because there is no footfall. When it was announced that dine-in will be shut in Delhi, even I had moved staff and resources from Delhi outlets to Gurgaon and Noida outlets, hoping that footfall would increase there, but that didnât happen, so we had to send most of the staff on leave. I think after Delhi restaurants were shut for dining, people got scared to dine out in Gurgaon and Noida too,ï¿½?says restaurateur Varun Puri. Restaurateur Umang Tewari says that time restrictions in Gurgaon and Noida is also deterrent for people who would otherwise drive to the neighbouring cities from Delhi for dining. âNo one wants to spend an hour driving to be at the restaurant for just an hour or so. On weekends too, people canât step out. So, businesses in Noida and Gurgaon are suffering as well,ï¿½?says Umang.Even though dine-in is allowed in Gurgaon and Noida, various COVID restrictions have limited the footfall (picture for representational purposes only)'Survival will be impossible for businesses if restrictions continue for longâRestaurateurs say that businesses across NCR have been impacted and many outlets might face permanent closure if restrictions continue for long. âRestaurants are always the first to be shut during COVID restrictions and last to open. It is becoming very difficult for us to run businesses when we are allowed to stay open for just a few months at a stretch,ï¿½?says Umang Tewari. Kabir Suri, restaurateur and president, National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), had earlier said in a statement, âRight from the onset of COVID, the food and beverage industry has been one of the worst-hit. We somehow survived so far, but with the new guidelines in Delhi, it seems highly unlikely that we can sustain any longer. We were shut for most of last year. We have been operating at 50 per cent capacity and restricted hours since then. We had just started seeing some respectable surge in consumption which prompted us to hire back our people but now we are in a fix. These new guidelines, which prohibits dining completely and allows only deliveries, is completely unsustainable. It is like an excruciatingly slow death for an erstwhile vibrant industry.ï¿½?For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

714,0,Ukraine invasion: TikTok's global ambitions take another hit as Russia's 'fake news' law forces suspension,723 words,scmp.com,"Chinese-owned app TikTok, the countryâs first social media platform with global influence, has suspended live streaming and new content in Russia to comply with a law that criminalises the spreading of what the Kremlin calls âfake informationï¿½? The suspension of new uploads by users in Russia, which has a population of 144 million, is another setback for its global expansion plans after a permanent ban by New Delhi last year. TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, the worldâs most valuable unicorn, is not available in China as it was designed for the international market.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge [https://www.scmp.com/knowledge], our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. As such, it has largely followed its Western peers by banning Russian state media from using the app in the European Union, and by adding state media labels to certain channels. The TikTok policy is in sharp contrast to its Chinese version Douyin, which is filled with information sourced from Russian state media, amplified by Chinaâs own state media outlets. TikTokâs position is also not in line with the Chinese government, which has refused to call Russiaâs military action in Ukraine an âinvasionï¿½? and officially opposes any sanctions against Moscow. On Monday, Chinaâs foreign minister Wang Yi called [https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3169604/china-says-it-keen-play-constructive-role-resolving-ukraine?module=lead_hero_story&pgtype=homepage] Russia its âmost important strategic partnerï¿½? TikTok âis acting in the interest of its employees and users to protect them from draconian laws,ï¿½?said Alex Capri, a research fellow at Hinrich Foundation and business lecturer at the National University of Singapore. However, âas a Chinese company, the question will arise regarding possible pressure from Beijing to fall in line with Chinaâs geopolitical priorities and public position regarding Russiaï¿½? he added. In 2021, TikTok downloads in Russia totalled 26.4 million, accounting for 3.6 per cent of total downloads globally, including those for its Chinese sibling Douyin, according to market tracker Sensor Tower. While TikTok has played a key role in disseminating information about the war ï¿½?with some even calling it the âTikTok Warï¿½?ï¿½?the platform remained silent for 10 days after Russiaâs invasion. On March 5, TikTok issued a statement highlighting its âstate-controlled media policyï¿½?and policy on âcombating misinformationï¿½? It would follow Twitter and Facebook to âapply labels to content from some state-controlled media accountsï¿½? the TikTok statement said. TikTokâs attempts to walk a tightrope when it comes to the war in Ukraine reflect the challenges it faces in navigating geopolitical confrontations, even though the app has positioned itself as an apolitical platform where users can share fun videos. India, which used to be TikTokâs biggest market in terms of users, banned the app in the summer of 2020 after a deadly border clash with China, and made the ban permanent last year on national security grounds. TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew told Bloomberg last week that it was âchallenging to build a global companyï¿½?because âyou need to be global and local at the same timeï¿½? A week after Russia launched its military attack on Ukraine, the Kremlin passed a so-called âfake newsï¿½?law that imposes prison sentences of up to 15 years on those spreading information that contradictrs the Russian governmentâs narrative on the war. The legislation coincided with Russiaâs blocking of Facebook and Twitter in Russia. Several Western digital giants, including Microsoft, Netflix and Epic Games, have also suspended sales in the country. Before TikTokâs suspension in Russia, the app had seen a slight dip in its popularity. In the week starting February 24, when Russian president Vladimir Putin announced a âspecial military operationï¿½?in Ukraine, TikTok had 476,000 and 118,000 downloads in Russia and Ukraine respectively, down from 516,000 and 127,000 a week before, according to Sensor Tower."

337,0,Confident Crown boss supports US takeover,432 words,The West Australian,"âHowever, uncertainty does remain and in regards to those circumstances and the underlying value of Crown we believe the cash price of $13.10 per share represents a compelling offer for shareholders to consider,ï¿½?Mr McCann said. He also said the recommendation by the board to back in the $9 billion bid for Crown considered a number of issues including an assessment of the underlying value of shares, which was ânot a short-term, point-in-time analysisï¿½? Mr McCann, pictured, said he had not heard directly from Crownâs biggest shareholder James Packer about how he intended to vote his 37 per cent stake in the company, but said it was Crownâs recommendation that he and other investors support Blackstoneâs bid.  Crownâs rival and potential suitor Star Entertainment Group on Thursday ruled out a bidding war for the casino company. The results highlighted that Crown fell deeper into the red as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns on the east coast and operating restrictions, despite growing revenue by 34 per cent to $778.6m. The company racked up closure costs ï¿½?which included costs incurred at Crown Melbourne, Crown Perth and Crown Sydney due to government-directed shutdowns ï¿½?of $79.2m.  Crown also released a trading update on Thursday that showed the outbreak of the Omicron variant in Victoria and NSW adversely impacted its Melbourne and Sydney operations at the start of the calendar year due to absenteeism. Crown Perth was affected by precautionary measures such as mask-wearing, with average weekly revenue for the first six weeks of the 2022 calendar year down 23 per cent on the average weekly revenue performance during the first half. Mr McCann said he was looking forward to the borders opening and bringing back gaming revenue and hospitality resources. He said the food and beverage business had been âa bit of a challengeï¿½? struggling to reach full capacity. âOn week nights some of our restaurants are closed ... but weâre encouraged by what weâre hearing about where governments are moving,ï¿½?he said."
445,0,High roller fails to stop Aussie casino from suing over alleged $44m debt,579 words,The Straits Times,"""The judgment in the Singapore proceeding made it clear that it was only by the procedural defence, available to Dr Wong in that forum, that the case was dismissed,"" wrote Judge of Appeal Philip McMurdo last month on behalf of the appeal court. The Star Entertainment had sued Dr Wong in the Singapore High Court in February 2019 for purported losses at the casino in Queensland between July 26 and Aug 2 in 2018. The Star sought to recover A$43,209,853.22, which is the value of a dishonoured cheque he had signed that breached a cheque cashing facility agreement inked with him. In the Singapore International Commercial Court decision grounds issued in 2020, International Judge Jeremy Cooke had held that The Star's claim fell foul of Section 5(2) of the Civil Law Act, citing a previous Court of Appeal decision. The section prohibits the recovery of gaming debts, subject to certain exceptions. Court documents said that a year earlier in 2017, Dr Wong had travelled to Australia and gambled at a Sydney casino operated by a company related to The Star. On that trip, he signed a blank cheque, but left it undated as well as the payee and the amount blank. In a deal he made with The Star in 2018, it was agreed that if Dr Wong provided ""a replacement cheque"" to The Star with the amount and date left blank, The Star was authorised to complete that cheque with an amount equal to what was outstanding and to date the cheque. Based on that provision, The Star filled out the cheque, inserting the amount of S$45,145,654.64, the date of Sept 7, 2018, and its name as the payee. The Star deposited the cheque into its account with the National Australia Bank, but by then Dr Wong had taken action which resulted in the cheque being dishonoured, according to court documents. In the current lawsuit, which commenced in 2020, The Star claimed A$43,209,853.22 as damages for breach of the facility agreement. Dr Wong, a Singaporean, applied but failed to have the lawsuit dismissed or obtain a stay on it by a Brisbane judge. He then took his case to the Court of Appeal, which dismissed his case with costs. The court said last month in its judgment: ""What is clear is that The Star has endeavoured throughout to prosecute its claim to a determination on the merits. ""In hindsight, the Singapore proceeding could be said to have caused an unfortunate delay in the ultimate resolution of this dispute."" But such a criticism about delay was not sufficient evidence to say that The Star's conduct in filing this lawsuit in Queensland ""would serve to bring the administration of justice into disrepute"", said the court."
204,1,How to cultivate agri-startups,909 words,BusinessLine (The Hindu),"Economic Survey . However, the share of agri-startups in this is negligible. It appears that the startup ecosystem in India is skewed in favour of services ï¿½?Big Data, Edtech, fintech, logistics and supply chain activities ï¿½?rather than agriculture and manufacturing. While startups have several options to mobilise funds, their early stage break-through funding normally comes from angel investors (private equity and venture capital) and the government (seed capital). While venture capitalists are keen on investing in startups based on, among other things, their disruptive business model, high growth potential and their ability to make quick profits, agri-startups have been lagging in attracting funds. Need for agri-startups It is a well-established fact that Indian agriculture is largely not a viable profession due to many structural issues. As a result, very few investors are interested in deploying their funds in this sector. However, India is a rural-centric and agri-based economy, and nearly 60 per cent of the population depends on this sector for livelihood. Therefore, agri-startup entrepreneurs need to be encouraged in the following ways: First , seed capital from the banks and hand-holding of agri-startups by institutions such as National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), by extending credit plus services, will go a long way in this direction. In September 2020, the Reserve Bank of India directed banks to treat loans up to Rs. 50 crore to agri-startups under priority sector lending. Further, the announcement of a fund for agri-startups by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget speech is a welcome move. The exclusive fund for agri-startups and rural enterprises will be launched through NABARD in order to give a fillip to the farm produce value chain. However, the government should ensure âease of fundingï¿½?for agri-entrepreneurs to attain the intended objectives. Second, by taking a cue from the social business model promoted by Muhammad Yunus, agri-startup entrepreneurs may tap low-cost funds. Third, a dedicated exchange for agri-startups may be established just like a stock exchange for small and medium enterprises. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) may stipulate liberal regulatory norms for listing of agri-startups on the bourses. This will pave the way for raising much needed risk capital for scaling up agri-startups and rural enterprises. Fourth, renewed thrust on collectives ï¿½?Farmer Producers Organisations (FPOs) ï¿½?will enhance the economic viability of agriculture by fostering penetration of technology and technical knowhow, improving productivity, and enabling enhanced access to inputs and services to the farmers. This will improve the collective bargaining as well as purchasing power of farmers so that they will be able to pay for the services of agri-startups in India. AgroStar, an agri-startup, offers an online marketplace for farmers to buy farm inputs besides providing real-time advice on management of their crops to increase their yields. Similarly, Ninjacart, and WayCool offer B2B platforms to control end-to-end agricultural supply chains to enable the farmers to sell their produce through multiple distribution channels. Fifth, the entrepreneurs should be imparted with financial literacy and education as the startup world is full of domain professionals and engineers, who hardly know anything about finance and investors. Therefore, entrepreneurs would be successful in mobilising capital from the market if they team up with agricultural researchers, financial experts, and technology wizards. For instance, IIT Madras and Tamil Nadu Agricultural University promoted incubation centres and accelerators to promote agri-entrepreneurs by connecting the dots in the ecosystem. Sixth, agri-startups that focus on climate change and disaster management will flourish in the near future. Even international agencies such as the World Bank and International Fund for Agricultural Development are willing to assist agri-startups in the context of achievement of sustainable development goals in general, climate action (SDG 13) in particular. Seventh, angel investors, venture capitalists and private equity holders may be given tax incentives on capital gains apart from providing ease of doing business at the time of their exit from the agri-startups. More specifically, the government should create an investor-friendly regime to attract funds in the agri-startup sector. Eighth, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and State Agricultural Universities have developed numerous farmer-friendly technologies but the same have not been commercialised so far. So policymakers may be proactive in this context by identifying right stakeholders under public private partnership, for conversion of brilliant ideas into useful products/services. Ninth, an insurance mechanism may be developed to de-risk genuine failures of agri-entrepreneurs. This will improve their risk appetite. Finally , agri-startups will flourish in India if they are associated with industry associations like Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Indian Chamber of Food & Agriculture, NASSCOM, etc., especially for testing/validation of prototypes before their launch. In sum, concerted efforts should be made for promotion of agri-startups in order to implement climate-smart agricultural practices in rural India, thereby ensuring food and nutritional security of the nation.

553,1,RISE IN PRODUCER PRICES HIGHLIGHTS INFLATION // Brisk Q1 results for Minnesotaâs Fastenal,611 words,Star-Tribune,"The company said pricing actions they took in the second half of 2021 and during the first quarter helped to offset inflationary pressures on transportation costs, fuel and products it distributes to customers. Fastenal distributes fasteners, safety products and other products through its network of branch locations, Onsite locations and its FMI devices (Fastenal Managed Inventory) ï¿½?which include scanned stocking locations, industrial vending machines and bins that hold bulk components managed through infrared, RFID and scaled bins. Fastenal expects much of its future growth to come from its FMI Technology and Onsite locations (dedicated sales and service centers staffed by Fastenal but generally inside or adjacent to a customer location). During the first quarter the company signed a record 106 new Onsite locations and are on pace in 2022 to meet their annual goal of signing 375 to 400 Onsite locations. The signings are a further signal to Fastenal that the business environment is normalizing. Fastenal also said revenue through its FMI Technology was $610.5 million, up 48.4% from the first quarter of 2021. Supply-chain challenges still persist and the labor market remains tight but Fastenal CEO Dan Florness told analysts on the companyâs earnings call that conditions have stabilized and that he has heard anecdotally from his regional managers that they have been starting to see more applicants for positions with the company. During the quarter, Fastenal achieved two important business milestones in March, announcing that its international business and e-commerce operations both exceeded $100 million in monthly revenue for the first time. The company also announced that it would resume two important in-person company events. For years public companies have been transitioning to virtual annual meetings and nearly every company held virtual annual meetings the past two years. Fastenal was one of the few to host a community event as part of the annual meeting before the pandemic but held virtual meetings the last two years. On April 23, Fastenal will again host its annual meeting in person at Winonaâs Remlinger Muscle Car Museum where it expects a good local turnout. It will be the first time the company hosts the annual event at an off-campus site but is planning to give tours of its new office building. On April 19 and 20, the company will conduct its annual customer expo in person after hosting virtual events the previous two years. The expo showcases the range of solutions Fastenal offers its customers and this year focuses on Fastenalâs supply-chain solutions. Fastenalâs shares ended Wednesday up 2% to $58.98.

674,1,Piano Maker Steinway Musical Instruments Plans IPO -- Barrons.com,340 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"Steinway did not disclose how many shares it would sell or a potential price range, according to an April 14 prospectus. That information should come in future filings. The New York-based company's shares will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker STWY.

57,1,"Legislature approves reimbursing towns with retail pot sales The legislation aims to increase the number of municipalities participating in the adult-use marijuana program by reimbursing them up to $20,000 for opting in.",655 words,Portland Press Herald,"Only about 10 percent of Maine municipalities allow adult-use sales. According to Sen. Benjamin Chipman, D-Cumberland, many communities are not participating because of the cost of rule development, issuing licenses, inspection, enforcement and more. The products are subject to a 10 percent excise tax, all of which goes into the state's General Fund and none directly back to the municipalities where the products are sold. Because of that, Chipman told the Senate on Friday, the state still has a viable black market. Allowing a reimbursement of up to $20,000 should help persuade towns and cities that have held off because of the cost, he said. According to the Maine Municipal Association, Maine is the only state that has legalized adult-use marijuana without allowing municipal governments to recover any expenses from their regulation of the industry. The original bill, proposed by Sen. Tiffany Roberts, D-South Berwick, would have given 5 percent of gross sales and excise tax revenue to the municipalities. ""In the development of Maine's adult-use marijuana industry, the state has asked municipalities to help balance the newly sanctioned use of this commodity, however, municipalities are not yet seeing a return on their investment,"" Roberts told the committee on taxation when introducing the bill. Kate Dufour, legislative advocate for the municipal association, said that while the group would have preferred to have revenue-sharing approved, she's glad to see the bill acknowledge that the state should take a role in assisting towns as they implement the state program. ""It's essentially putting your money where your mouth is,"" she said. The state has 85 recreational retail stores spread across about 50 municipalities. Another 180 stores are in various stages of the approval process, according to state data. In 2021, the adult-use market brought in just shy of $82 million, earning over $8 million in tax revenue for the state. John Burke, a Scarborough attorney specializing in cannabis licensing, told the committee that the cost of opting in has caused many towns and cities to institute significant licensing fees to offset costs. Portland, for example, has a $10,000 licensing fee, he said. In Lebanon, it's $50,000. ""Not having revenue sharing is preventing the state from receiving the type of revenue it anticipated from the adult use program, hurting the businesses lawfully operating in the adult use program and frustrating municipalities that were supposed to be partners with the State in administering (it),"" he wrote. ""Those municipalities not opting in continue to obtain a financial benefit (directly or indirectly) from these businesses, as much of the revenue generated by the Adult Use program goes into the General Fund."" Despite the rollout of the state's adult-use market in October 2020, Portland officials didn't approve retailers until March 2021. The implementation of business licensing and regulation has been time-consuming and costly for the city, said Jessica Hanscome, director of the city's department of permitting and inspections, in written testimony to the committee. She said the department had to hire three new staff members to help manage the workload brought on by the city's rollout of the market.

562,0,Japan ready to expand virus restrictions as infections surge,406 words,Associated Press Newswires,"The order will be finalized this week and is likely to take effect Friday, the government spokesman said Tuesday. The measures are expected to last for about three weeks in 16 regions, including Okinawa, Yamaguchi and Hiroshima, which were already placed under some restrictions earlier this month. Other areas seeing surging infections, such as Osaka, may be added later. âThe infections are rising at an unprecedented speed,ï¿½?Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters. Worries are growing about infections spreading so quickly that hospital systems may get stretched thin, he said. He acknowledged additional action may be needed if the numbers of people shoot up, required to undergo quarantine or hospitalization. About 80% of the Japanese population have received two vaccine shots, but only 1% the booster. The government has promised to speed up boosters, but most people wonât be getting them until after March or later, under the current schedule. The third dose is recommended particularly against omicron, which is causing more breakthrough infections than earlier forms of the virus. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is keen on avoiding public discontent of its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, widely seen as behind the ouster of the previous prime minister. Nationwide parliamentary elections will be held in a few months. Bars and eateries that abide by the government restrictions are eligible for aid. But some say that hasnât been enough. More than 20,000 new cases were reported Monday nationwide, showing cases are rising quickly because of omicron. Most experts think the case tally is an undercount because testing is not widespread.

987,0,Shops ditch Auckland CBD,396 words,The New Zealand Herald,"And the increase ï¿½?from 1.4 per cent to 14.4 per cent ï¿½?was recorded by Colliers NZ before the summer holidays and this yearâs Covid-19 Omicron outbreak, which further delayed the expected return of some shoppers and office workers to downtown Auckland after last yearâs 107-day Delta outbreak lockdown. Strip retail is when shops are sited next to each other in the traditional town centre style common in New Zealand before malls were invented. â[The 13 per cent increase] is the highest weâve recorded in our twice-yearly survey since the mid-1990s,ï¿½?Colliers head of research Chris Dibble said. âAgain, similar trend to office [vacancy data] though, high-quality, well-positioned retail as well as malls are outperforming in the CBD.ï¿½?Colliers NZ data released yesterday showed vacancy rates of office space in Aucklandâs CBD increased from 4.7 per cent in December 2019 to 10.9 per cent in December 2021. The doubling of office space for lease in central Auckland since before the pandemic signalled an unprecedented change in the way we work, with some big businesses shrinking traditionally large headquarters so workers can work some or all days from home. Some major Wellington companies and public service departments have also confirmed the switch to hybrid ï¿½?some days working at home and some in the office. Vacancy rates for retail space in Wellington CBD rose from 3.8 per cent in December 2019 to 4.9 per cent in December last year ï¿½?with a high of 7.8 per cent in December 2020. For various reasons, such as traditionally fewer tourists and foreign students, Wellington CBDâs retail sector had been âmuch more resilientï¿½?than Aucklandâs, Dibble said. While workers embrace the freedom and flexibility of fewer days travelling from home to office, their vanishing act has been wearing thin for Auckland CBD business owners. ï¿½?Rise of the suburbs, p37-39"
990,0,"Companies that refuse to exit Russia, and the evil of war",475 words,The Straits Times,"1. Withdrawal: Completely halting Russian engagements or exiting Russia. 2. Suspension: Temporarily curtailing operations while keeping return options open. 3. Scaling back: Scaling back some business operations while continuing others. 4. Buying time: Postponing future planned investment, development, or marketing while continuing substantive business. 5. Digging in: Defying demands for exit or reduction of activities. In my commentary, I describe how the list will exert peer pressure on companies to rethink their presence in Russia, particularly consumer-facing goods and services industries that are vulnerable to reputational damage and consumer boycotts. But ultimately, any firm's decision to withdraw from a country is nuanced and seldom binary. Companies must weigh the continued Russian military aggression and reputational cost of going against global opinion, against continuing to serve ordinary citizens who may be bystanders to geopolitical conflict.Ukraine war: The evil that men do Adolf Hitler and Nazism - after all these years - have remained morally instructive and perhaps even more so now, says Professor Chong Siow Ann in this commentary. One of Russian President Vladimir Putin's strangest justifications for the invasion of Ukraine - or the ""special military operation"" as he described it - is saving innocent civilians by ""de-Nazifying"" the country and toppling the government in Kyiv, which he claims has been seized by ""extreme nationalists and neo-Nazis"". This is even though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish and had relatives who perished in the Holocaust. How does one comprehend or justify the atrocities in Bucha - the mass graves and bodies of civilians scattered along its streets? Says Prof Chong: ""In the face of whatever evil being done to others, we should recall the incandescent words of Elie Wiesel: 'We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere'.""New podcast on social and political affairs And on the subject of Ukraine, here's a plug for the new Opinion podcast series, In Your Opinion.

But while the eccentric businessman - who is the richest man in the world with an estimated net worth of $260 billion - is known around the world for his professional endeavors, quirky lifestyle, and rocky romances, his life has not always been so high-profile. In fact, Musk, 50, experienced a difficult childhood thanks to a rocky relationship with his father - who the SpaceX founder has described as 'evil' in the past and a seemingly-lonely upbringing. Now, it seems, Musk has moved far past the tough times, in order to attempt to once again make financial history with his attempted takeover of Twitter. The SpaceX founder announced on Wednesday that he wants to buy Twitter for $41.39 billion - offering $54.20 per share in cash. It's been reported that Twitter's board of directors is meeting on Thursday afternoon to discuss Musk's historic bid and 'carefully review the proposal,' and that the company plans to hold an all-hands meeting later in the day to update employees. Musk said that he is pursuing the takeover of Twitter not for financial gain, but for the 'future of civilization,' adding that he has a 'Plan B' if his initial $41.3 billion offer fails. 'This is not about the economics,' he said at the TED2022 Conference in Vancouver on Thursday afternoon, as it was reported that Twitter's board is plotting to employ a 'poison pill' in order to stop his takeover attempt. 'My strong intuitive sense is having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is important to the future of civilization. The civilizational risk is decreased the more we can increase the trust of Twitter as a public platform. 'Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it's really important that people have both the reality and perception that they are able to speak freely, in the bounds of the law.' According to Bloomberg[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-14/elon-musk-launches-43-billion-hostile-takeover-of-twitter?cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_content=tech&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter], Musk is currently the wealthiest person in the world - with a net worth of around $260 billion. Besides launching his own aerospace manufacturing company - SpaceX - he also serves as the CEO of automobile company Tesla, Inc. and has created The Boring Company - a construction service dedicated to building tunnels. He has also co-founded Neuralink, a neurotech company, and artificial intelligence research laboratory OpenAI. Previously, he created Zip2 - an online directory that provided addresses and directions to newspapers - as well as X.com - an online banking system that was later turned into PayPal. But how did Musk go from a nerdy child living in South Africa with an absentee mother and emotionally abusive father to the richest man on Earth? Musk didn't have the easiest childhood - he was severely bullied by his classmates and it got so bad that he was once hospitalized after they pushed him down a set of stairs. As he entered his teen years, he dreamed of moving to America but struggled to find the funds. Against all odds, he eventually made it to the U.S. - through scholarships, loans, and working two jobs simultaneously - where he graduated from college and launched his first business. But not without more hardship - while starting his primary company in 1995, Musk became homeless and had to sleep on the couch in his office. As he gears up to potentially purchase Twitter and expand is already-enormous list of business ventures, FEMAIL has taken a look back at his career from start to finish - including how he escaped his abusive father to how he started his first million-dollar company without even having a place to live.  Elon Musk's childhood: How he overcame years of abuse from his 'evil' and 'terrible' father Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. For the first eight years of his life, he lived with his mom, Maye - a dietician and a model from Canada - and his dad, Errol - a South African engineer - as well as his siblings - younger brother, Kimbal, and younger sister, Tosca. He previously recalled his parents being absent for much of his childhood, revealing that he was often watched by a housekeeper. 'I just had a housekeeper who was there to make sure I didnât break anything,' he recalled to Rolling Stone [https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-the-architect-of-tomorrow-120850/]in a 2017 interview. 'She wasnât, like, watching me. I was off making explosives and reading books and building rockets and doing things that could have gotten me killed. Iâm shocked that I have all my fingers.' He fell in love with reading at a young age, and also credited 'books' with 'raising him.' As a young child, he had his adenoids - the lymphatic tissue located behind the nasal cavity - removed because doctors thought he was deaf. However, his mother later realized that he could hear, and that he was just 'in another world.' The business mogul grew up wealthy, with his dad once claiming that they 'had so much money, at times they couldn't even close their safe.' His parents divorced in 1980, and Musk went to live with his dad - which he later regretted. 'It was not a good idea,' he told the outlet, while reflecting on his decision to move in with his father. 'I felt sorry for my father, because my mother had all three kids. He seemed very sad and lonely by himself. So I thought, ""I can be company."" 'Yeah, I was sad for my father. But I didnât really understand at the time what kind of person he was.' He went on to call his dad a 'terrible human being,' adding that he 'carefully thought-out plans of evil.' 'You have no idea about how bad [it was],' he continued. 'Almost every crime you can possibly think of, he has done. Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done.' He added that although Errol was emotionally abusive, he never physically hurt him. In a statement to the outlet, Musk's father wrote: 'I love my children and would readily do whatever for them.' He also responded to Musk's claims during an interview with DailyMail.com months later, saying, 'Elon needs to grow up. He needs to get over himself. Iâm not going to hit back. 'Iâm going to wait until he comes to his senses. Heâs having a tantrum, like a spoilt child. He canât have what he wants and now I am apparently an evil monster.' Musk first became interested in computing and video games at age 10. By the time he was 12, he had already created his own video game - which he later sold to a company called Blastar for $500 after entering a local contest. Described as an 'awkward and introverted' kid, Musk was bullied throughout his childhood. It got so bad that he even had to be hospitalized after a group of his classmates threw him down the stairs at one point. 'For the longest time, I was the youngest and the smallest kid in the class because my birthday just happens to fall on almost the last day that they will accept you into school, June 28,' he recalled to Rolling Stone. 'And I was a late bloomer. So I was the youngest and the smallest kid in class for years and years. ï¿½?The gangs at school would hunt me down ï¿½?literally hunt me down.' He began taking karate, judo, and wrestling classes so he could learn to defend himself. And when he started to fight back, the bullying ended. After graduating from Pretoria Boys High School, he decided to apply for a Canadian passport so he could get closer to the United States. While waiting to be approved, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months. When asked why he wanted to move to North America, he later told 60 Minutes[https://youtu.be/52x0ukhE2Vo?t=323], 'It seemed like the vast majority of such things came from the United States. 'I also read a lot of comic books, and they all seemed to be set in the United States. So itâs like, ""Well, Iâm going to go to this place.""' He moved to Saskatchewan, Canada, in 1989, where he lived with a second-cousin for about a year. During that time, he worked odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill to get by. The billionaire recalled his father telling him that he was 'never going to make it' right before he left. '[He said] Iâm never going to make anything of myself. He called me an idiot all the time. Thatâs the tip of the iceberg, by the way,' he told Rolling Stone. He attended Queen's University in Ontario for two years before he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics in 1995. During college, he interned at an energy storage company called Pinnacle Research Institute, and at the video game developer Rocket Science Games. In 1995, he was accepted at Stanford University in California for a Ph.D. program, but dropped out two days into it. A deeper dive into the Musk family: How his siblings earned their own fame and fortune Musk's mother has been a model for more than 50 years now, appearing in campaigns for magazines like Time, New York Magazine, Elle Canada, Women's Day, and Vogue, and for brands like Special K, Revlon, and Target. She starred in BeyoncÃ©'s music video for her hit song Haunted in 2013, and made history in 2017, when she became CoverGirl's oldest spokesmodel at age 69. She also wrote her own memoir in 2019, called A Woman Makes a Plan: Advice for a Lifetime of Adventure, Beauty, and Success. While promoting the memoir, she recalled realizing that Musk was a 'genius' at age three. 'Well at thee, I knew he was a genius, but you still don't know if he's going to do great things,' she told CBS This Morning. 'Because many geniuses end up in a basement being a genius but not applying it.' In an essay for CNBC[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/31/elon-musk-mom-parenting-secret-to-raising-successful-kids.html], Maye admitted to feeling guilty about 'working full-time' when her kids were young, but added that she 'didn't have a choice.' 'Taking care of my children was the top priority; I worked hard to keep a roof over our heads, food in our stomach, and basic clothes on our back,' she wrote. Musk's siblings have launched major careers of their own over the years. His brother, Kimbal, is a well-known restaurateur, chef, and entrepreneur. He owns The Kitchen Restaurant Group - a collection of restaurants located throughout Colorado, Chicago, and Indianapolis. He also founded an urban farming company called Square Roots, which focuses on growing food in indoor, climate controlled shipping containers. He also sits on the boards of two of his older brother's companies - Tesla and SpaceX - and he helped co-found the software company Zip2 with him in 1995. He was married twice - first, to a woman named Jen Lewin whom he shares three kids with. He then married Christiana Wyly in April 2018, who is an environmental activist and the daughter of billionaire Sam Wyly. As for Musk's sister, Tosca works as a filmmaker in South Africa and has made quite a name for herself in the movie industry. She directed her first feature film, called Puzzled, in 2001 - and her older brother served as the film's executive producer. She has since produced over a dozen movies, TV shows, and web series. Musk's growing business empire: How he went from a nerdy kid in South Africa to a billionaire mogul In 1995, Musk founded a web software company called Zip2 with his brother, Kimbal, and businessman Greg Kouri. The company was funded by angel investors and it created an online guide which provided newspapers with maps, directions, and yellow pages. And the tech mogul wants people to know that his dad did not help him start his first business. 'One thing [my dad] claims is he gave us a whole bunch of money to start, my brother and I, to start up our first company. This is not true,' he told Rolling Stone in 2017. 'He was irrelevant. He paid nothing for college. My brother and I paid for college through scholarships, loans and working two jobs simultaneously. 'The funding we raised for our first company came from a small group of random angel investors in Silicon Valley.' While working on the company, Musk later revealed that he couldn't afford to pay rent, so he often slept on a couch in his office and showered at the local YMCA. 'When my brother and I were starting our first company, instead of getting an apartment, we just rented a small office and we slept on the couch,' he said [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Qh-vwpYH8]in 2014. 'We showered at the YMCA and we were so hard-up that we only had one computer.' It's been said that when he and Kimbal disagreed on business matters, they would settle them by wrestling. He recalled working on the website 'seven days a week, all the time,' and would often stay up all night coding it. Eventually, Zip2 was purchased by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. Through the sale, Musk received $22 million for his seven per cent share. He then went on to co-found X.com - an online financial service. It took off pretty quickly - earning more than 200,000 customers during its initial months of operation. The company eventually merged with Confinity - who owned PayPal - and in 2000, Musk was replaced as CEO with Confinity founder Peter Thiel. The company then renamed X.com to PayPal, and sold it to eBay for $1.5 billion. Musk was still the largest shareholder at the time, and received $175.8 million from the sale. After becoming inspired by Mars Society's plans to place a small greenhouse on Mars and grow plants on the planet, Musk tried to obtain refurbished missiles from Russia. However, after he was told that he'd have to pay $8 million to purchase the missiles, he decided to start a company that could build its own affordable rockets - and SpaceX was born. 'After my second or third trip back from Russia, I was like, ""Whoa, thereâs got to be a better way to solve this rocket problem,""' he said at the 2018 South by Southwest conference[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzlUyrccbos]. Convinced that he could bring down the cost of getting to space, he teamed up with rocket engineer Tom Mueller to found SpaceX in 2002 - originally called Space Exploration Technologies Corp. - using $100 million of his previous fortune.  SpaceX launched its first rocket, called Falcon 1, in 2006, but it failed to reach Earth's orbit. The company faced two more failed attempts before it successfully made it into orbit in 2008. The company has gone on to release a series of space transportation devices, including the Falcon 9 rocket, and has become one of the most successful aerospace manufacturers in the world.  SpaceX has also launched its own satellite internet constellation called Starlink - which provides internet coverage to 29 countries on Earth. Musk invested $6.5 million - becoming the majority shareholder - in Tesla Motors in 2004, an electric car company. He then became heavily involved in the company and was promoted to CEO in 2008.  Tesla's stock has continuously risen since its first initial public offering in 2010, and as of 2020, it was considered the most valuable carmaker in the world. In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion. In 2016, Tesla acquired SolarCity - a solar energy company created by Musk's cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive - and together, they created Tesla Energy. Inside Musk's rollercoaster love life: How he has fathered seven children with two women and gone through multiple divorces Musk's love life has been heavily covered in the media throughout his career - going through multiple divorces (including two with the same wife he married twice) and welcoming seven kids along the way. He and his first wife, Justine Wilson, now 49, met while they were both attending Queen's University, and they tied the knot in 2000. While discussing the day they first met, Wilson described Musk as a 'clean-cut, upper-class boy with a South African accent who appeared in front of her one afternoon as she was leaping up the steps to her dorm,' during an essay for Marie Claire[https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a5380/millionaire-starter-wife/], which was written in 2010. 'He said we'd met at a party I knew I hadn't been to. (Years later, he would confess that he had noticed me from across the common room and decided he wanted to meet me.) 'He invited me out for ice cream. I said yes, but then blew him off with a note on my dorm-room door. 'Several hours later, my head bent over my Spanish text in an overheated room in the student center, I heard a polite cough behind me. 'Elon was smiling awkwardly, two chocolate-chip ice cream cones dripping down his hands. He's not a man who takes no for an answer.' They couple tragically lost their 10-week old son, Nevada Alexander, in 2002, when he died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). They then welcomed twins Griffin and Xavier, now 17, in 2004, and triplets Kai, Saxon, and Damian, now 15, in 2006; all five of the children were conceived via IVF. In her essay, Wilson recalled feeling more like an 'employee' than a 'wife' to Musk. 'He had grown up in the male-dominated culture of South Africa, and the will to compete and dominate that made him so successful in business did not magically shut off when he came home,' she explained. 'This, and the vast economic imbalance between us, meant that in the months following our wedding, a certain dynamic began to take hold. 'Elon's judgment overruled mine, and he was constantly remarking on the ways he found me lacking. ""I am your wife,"" I told him repeatedly, ""not your employee."" '""If you were my employee,"" he said just as often, ""I would fire you.""' She said that what ultimately led to their divorce in 2008 was a car accident, where her first thought was, 'My husband is going to kill me.' She added: 'In my mind's eye, I could suddenly see myself: a woman who'd gotten very thin, and very blonde, stumbling out of a very expensive car with the front-left wheel smashed in. 'I barely recognized myself. I had turned into a trophy wife - and I sucked at it. I wasn't detail-oriented enough to maintain a perfect house or be a perfect hostess. 'I could no longer hide my boredom when the men talked and the women smiled and listened. I wasn't interested in Botox or makeup or reducing the appearance of the scars from my C-sections. 'And no matter how many highlights I got, Elon pushed me to be blonder. ""Go platinum,"" he kept saying, and I kept refusing. 'Not long after the accident, I sat on our bed with my knees pulled up to my chest and tears in my eyes. I told Elon, in a soft voice that was nonetheless filled with conviction, that I needed our life to change. 'I didn't want to be a sideline player in the multimillion-dollar spectacle of my husband's life. I wanted equality. I wanted partnership. I wanted to love and be loved, the way we had before he made all his millions.' After one month of counseling, Musk filed for divorce. As of 2010 when the essay was written, Wilson said she and Musk were 'estranged,' but that she did not regret their relationship. 'Although I am estranged from Elon - when it comes to the children, I deal with his assistant - I don't regret my marriage,' she wrote. 'I've worked through some anger, both at Elon for rendering me so disposable, and at myself for buying into a fairy tale when I should have known better. 'But I will always respect the brilliant and visionary person that he is. I also can't regret the divorce (our case was bifurcated, which means that even though the property issues aren't settled, our marriage is legally dead). 'Elon and I share custody of the children, who are thriving. I feel grounded now, and deeply grateful for my life.' Their five children have largely managed to remain out of the spotlight, although it was revealed in 2018 that all of boys were being educated at a radical, ultra-exclusive school set up by the Tesla founder at his SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California. The 'experimental' school, which is called Ad Astra, meaning 'to the stars' in Latin, was set up in 2014. As of 2018, it was being attended by a very small, select group of students, including Musk's five sons and the offspring of several SpaceX employees. Although few details about the school's methods have been revealed, some reports suggest that its students are subjected to a host of very unconventional teaching techniques. Previous reports on Ad Astra also stated that the children are allowed to skip any subjects they don't like, spend time building flamethrowers and learn how to 'defeat evil A.I.s.' Musk created Ad Astra to 'exceed traditional school metrics on all relevant subject matter through unique project-based learning experiences,' according to a previously unreported document filed with the IRS and uncovered by tech-focused publication Ars Technica[https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/first-space-then-auto-now-elon-musk-quietly-tinkers-with-education/?amp=1&__twitter_impression=true]. Following his split from Wilson, Musk began dating British star Talulah Riley, who is most known for her roles in Pride & Prejudice, St. Trinian's, Fritton's Gold, The Boat That Rocked, Inception, Westworld, and Bloodshot. It was said that they met at a bar in London, with Ashlee Vance writing in her book, Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, that they 'hit it off immediately.' 'I remember thinking that this guy probably didnât get to talk to young actresses a lot and that he seemed quite nervous,' Riley said of the night they met. 'I decided to be really nice to him and give him a nice evening. Little did I know that heâd spoken to a lot of pretty girls in his life.' Rile, now 36 - who was a virgin when she began dating Musk in 2008 - first tied the knot with the Tesla architect in 2010. However, their first marriage ended in 2012, when she reportedly walked away with $16 million as part of a divorce settlement. 'It was an amazing four years. I will love you forever. You will make someone very happy one day,' he tweeted at the time. By the following summer, they had remarried. But then, in December 2014, she filed for divorce a second time, only to withdraw her lawsuit the following year. In March 2016, Riley requested a divorce a third time, and the pair split for good; the couple did not have any children together. Musk told Forbes [https://www.forbes.com/sites/hannahelliott/2012/01/18/elon-musk-to-divorce-wife-talulah-riley/?sh=3cb9a24871b2]at the time, 'We took some time apart for several months to see if absence makes the heart grow fonder, and unfortunately it did not. 'I still love her, but Iâm not in love with her. And I canât really give her what she wants.' He also called her 'a great woman' and said he will 'always be friends' with her. At the time, he said he had no interest in marrying again for a while, adding, 'I think it would be extremely unwise for me to jump into a third marriage without spending considerable time figuring out if the third one will work. 'It was never my intention to have a short marriage. Essentially Iâd want to be super sure before getting married again, but I certainly would love to be in a relationship. For sure.' Musk dated actress Amber Heard, 35, for several months in late 2016 and early 2017, after he reportedly pursued her for many years. Heard's ex-husband Johnny Depp later accused Heard of cheating on him with Musk while they were still married, but both Musk and Heard denied the affair. They split in the summer of 2017, and afterwards, he told Rolling Stone in 2017 that he was 'really in love' with Heard and that their breakup 'hurt bad.' 'She broke up with me more than I broke up with her, I think,' he told the outlet at the time. 'Iâve been in severe emotional pain for the last few weeks. Severe. It took every ounce of will to be able to do the Model 3 event and not look like the most depressed guy around. For most of that day, I was morbid.' He continued, 'If Iâm not in love, if Iâm not with a long-term companion, I cannot be happy. 'I will never be happy without having someone. Going to sleep alone kills me. Itâs not like I donât know what that feels like: Being in a big empty house, and the footsteps echoing through the hallway, no one there ï¿½?and no one on the pillow next to you. F**k. How do you make yourself happy in a situation like that?' Musk then began dating singer Grimes in April 2018, a month before they made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala. A source told Page Six[https://pagesix.com/2018/05/07/elon-musk-quietly-dating-musician-grimes/] at the time that they met online 'through a joke about artificial intelligence that Musk had planned to tweet, but discovered Grimes had already made.' Rumors started to swirl that they had split by that fall, after the pair unfollowed each other on Twitter, however, Grimes insisted that they were still together during a March 2019 interview with Wall Street Journal[https://wsj-articles-legacy.sc.onservo.com/articles/the-life-and-death-of-grimes-11553084548]. Then, in January 2020, she announced that she was pregnant with their first child via Instagram, when she shared a pic of her baby bump, with no caption. They then welcomed their son in May of the same year, who they named X Ã A-12, but they call him 'X' for short. 'Describing her role in her son's life, Grimes told Vanity Fair [https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/03/grimes-cover-story-on-music-and-mars]that she has taken responsibility for 'handling his creative stuff,' while she notes that Musk 'really sees [X] as a protÃ©gÃ©.' Just over a year after welcoming their son, who now 23 months old, Musk told Page Six[https://pagesix.com/2021/09/24/elon-musk-and-grimes-break-up-after-three-years-together/] that they were 'semi-separated.' 'We are semi-separated but still love each other, see each other frequently and are on great terms,' he said in September 2021. 'Itâs mostly that my work at SpaceX and Tesla requires me to be primarily in Texas or traveling overseas and her work is primarily in LA. Sheâs staying with me now and Baby X is in the adjacent room.' Grimes relocated in December from her home in Los Angeles to a property in Austin, Texas, where she is currently residing in a 'sleepy neighborhood cul-de-sac' that is located 'a short drive' away from Tesla's factory. They then welcomed their second child via surrogate that same month - a baby girl named Exa Dark SiderÃ¦l. According to the singer, the newborn's quirky first name, Exa, was inspired by the supercomputing term exaFLOPS, which is 'the ability to perform one quintillion floating-point operations per second,' while her second name Dark, is a nod to dark matter and 'the unknown.' 'People fear it but truly itâs the absence of photons. Dark matter is the beautiful mystery of our universe,' she told the magazine. Finally, SiderÃ¦l, which is pronounced sigh-deer-ee-el, is a 'more elven spelling' of sidereal, which Grimes described as 'the true time of the universe, star time, deep space time, not our relative earth time.' Their daughter's third name is also a reference to Grimes' favorite Lord of the Rings character, the elf Galadriel. The couple will call their baby daughter 'Y' for short. During the time of the Vanity Fair interview, Grimes said she 'would probably refer to Musk as her boyfriend,' adding that the relationship was 'very fluid.' She said: 'We live in separate houses. Weâre best friends. We see each other all the timeï¿½? We just have our own thing going on, and I donât expect other people to understand it. This is the best itâs ever been.... We just need to be free.' However, after it came out, she took to Twitter to reveal that they had since broken up. 'Me and E have broken up *again* since the writing of this article,' she wrote on March 10. 'But heâs my best friend and the love of my life.' Both Grimes and Musk noted to Vanity Fair that their current separate living situation is the best for both of them, explaining that they each have very different needs and likes when it comes to creating a home. While Musk likes things to be 'reasonably neat,' Grimes is described as taking a more creative, artistic approach to her home. She also enjoys Japanese art and anime, which the Tesla founder explained he 'doesn't like.' Grimes said she was determined to keep her daughter's life as private as possible - unlike her son X who has been featured numerous times on his father's social media accounts, and has been seen out in public with his parents on several occasions. She noted that her son 'is just out there,' largely because Musk has been 'bringing him to everything,' however she is eager to ensure that her daughter will not have to face the same public scrutiny, even stating that 'the best situation' for the parents would be for 'her to train the girl' and for 'him to train the boy.' 'Didnât mean for them to find out about my daughter so please respect her privacy as Iâd love her to be able to live as private of a life as possible,' she added on Twitter, while discussing the article. 'This is the last time Iâll do any traditional press [cause] Iâm a pretty private person. Havenât done press in a long time [cause] my personal life is so mad and I think itâs hard to foreground my work but also maybe itâs all intertwined at this point.' Aside from his complex dating life, Musk's living condition is also somewhat of a mystery. It is currently unclear where exactly the business mogul - who has an estimated net worth of around $221 billion - is living. He announced last year that he was 'selling almost all physical possessions,' including several California properties amounting to more than $100 million - and $15 billion worth of Tesla stock. He purportedly then moved into a 75-square-foot $50,000 'Tiny House' close to SpaceX's Starbase rocket-launch site in Boca Chica, Texas."
239,0,"Sommelier, 30, who was fired from Salt Bae's Knightsbridge restaurant after 'eating an avocado after 5.30pm' brands the steakhouse 'McDonald's for rich people' and claims guests are served 'frozen chips and Heinz ketchup'",1204 words,Mail Online,"* He said Â£1,000 bottles of wine were sold for up to Â£3,000 in staggering markups * Sommelier of eight years branded the pricey eatery 'toxic' in a scathing review A sommelier who was fired from Salt Bae's restaurant for 'eating an avocado after 5.30pm' has branded the eatery a 'toxic working environment'. Guillermo Perez, 30, from Madrid, compared Nusr-Et, in Knightsbridge, central London, to a 'McDonald's for rich people' for charging guests extortionate prices - despite allegedly serving them 'frozen chips with Heinz ketchup'. Turkish chef Nusret GÃ¶kÃ§e rose to fame back in 2017 for his unusual meat seasoning technique in which he lets salt run down his elbow, and has often been spotted slicing meat for customers at his pricey restaurant. Specials include a Golden Giant Tomahawk steak for Â£1,450, Golden Giant Striplion for Â£1,350 and Golden Kafes for Â£500 - while a simple burger and coke will set you back Â£100 and Â£9 respectively. David Beckham, Jason Statham and Naomi Campbell are among the famous faces to have eaten at Nusret's restaurants - which include locations in New York, Dubai and Istanbul. But sommelier of eight years Mr Perez, who has lived in the UK since 2012, claimed the TikTok star's London outlet was 'immoral' in a scathing attack, adding that bottles of wine were being marked up by 'incredible' amounts. 'Bottles worth Â£1,000 would be sold for up to Â£3,000, for example,' Mr Perez told MailOnline, 'Of course you can charge people whatever price you want, but it's pretty immoral when the quality of the food and service does not match the price. 'One day I saw a big bag of frozen chips and I thought 'really? That's what we are serving people?' 'And they had Heinz ketchup and mayonnaise, which you can get from the shop.' It follows a swathe of savage reviews on TripAdvisor , which claimed the meat was 'smelly' and 'not at all tasty' - with one telling would-be punters to 'avoid it like the plague.' Mr Perez continued: 'I have worked in Mayfair and other good restaurants, but my experience there was very disappointing.' He added: 'I think people there want to show how much money they have, almost everybody paid in cash.' Mr Perez was dragged into HR on January 20 after he was berated by a chef in the staff canteen - which is shared with a hotel ï¿½?for eating his own avocado and rice. Workers from Nusr-Et are not allowed to eat food from the canteen after 5.30pm, Mr Perez said. 'I arrived with my own food at 5.35pm and took a plate and the chef started shouting at me telling me I can't eat from the canteen,' alleged Mr Perez, whose past work experience includes the upmarket Sushisamba, 'I tried to explain that the avocado was mine and that I was just taking a plate and some cutlery and he accused me of being aggressive and called my general manager.' Within 30 minutes, Mr Perez was told to report to HR, where he was chastised for 'arguing with the chef' and told not to return after that day. He was told he would not receive his week's holiday pay or work a notice period. Mr Perez, who has trained as a sommelier in Argentina and worked in top restaurants in Mayfair and central London, said: 'I told them that it was not fair because I had not received any verbal or written warning, and I had done nothing wrong. 'I wanted to take legal action but I could not really do anything because I was still on my probation period.' Mr Perez said he pressed HR for better justification for his sacking, before he was told that he had not sold enough wine. 'I asked her to look up the latest sales figures, which showed I had actually sold the second-most out of all the sommeliers ï¿½?even though I had worked fewer hours, so their reason was a lie,' he claimed. 'They also said when they hired me that my performance would not be rated on how much I sold, but then they complained that I did not sell enough in my first month.' Mr Perez said the working environment was 'toxic' due to the managers and employees who had been brought over from Greece, where Salt Bae's first restaurant was launched. He accused the managers of favouring the staff brought over from Mykonos, as they were often given the biggest or most important tables to serve. When Mr Perez tried to challenge the system, he claims a staff member tried to sabotage his service by knocking him as he served Â£60 shots to guests. 'The staff brought from Greece and Turkey were terrible and unprofessional,' he claimed, 'Everyone else, who had been trained in the UK or had experience in the hospitality sector in London were lovely and did a great job.' Mr Perez is joining a cruise ship in two months to be a sommelier for a luxury onboard restaurant. But it means he has been left jobless and unable to find work after being unexpectedly let go from Salt Bae's restaurant. 'I've had to use my own savings to pay rent and live because of course no one wants to hire someone for just one-and-a-half or two months,' he said. 'I wish I had never accepted a job there.' It comes after diners were left less than impressed with the glitzy eatery in December, when a slew of bad reviews left it at number 20,491 out of 23,811 in the capital on TripAdvisor . One person commented: 'Do not be fooled by the glitz and glam and waste your money. 'Terrible food. Meat was not at all tasty. Ended up going for a Â£5 kebab after a Â£300 bill... this place is the biggest joke in London.' Meanwhile another wrote: 'Insult to humanity. Worst food, worst service. Paid over Â£1,800 for three of us. 'Poor quality, smelly meat, small portions. Rather spend Â£50 in the local restaurant, will be better! Never again! Stay away, it's a death trap!' A third added: 'Avoid like the plague. 'I travel all over the world conducting my business and have eaten in many many restaurants but this is the worst one yet. 'The ones in L.A, Turkey and Dubai are amazing and I couldn't recommend them highly enough but I would never return to Nusr-et in London. 'I dined here with some business associates and felt embarrassed afterwards that I'd chosen such a god awful place to dine in. This place is all hype and no substance give it a miss or dine at your own peril.' MailOnline has contacted Nusr-Et for comment. Revealed: The eye-wateringly expensive menu in full"
889,0,"Facebook stalling report on human rights impact in India, allege whistleblowers",527 words,The Guardian,"More than 20 organizations on Wednesday joined whistleblowers Frances Haugen[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/24/frances-haugen-i-never-wanted-to-be-a-whistleblower-but-lives-were-in-danger] and Sophie Zhang[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/12/facebook-fake-engagement-whistleblower-sophie-zhang], as well as former Facebook vice-president Brian Boland, to demand the company, now called Meta, release its findings. âAs a result of the consistent and continuous barrage of hate on social media, particularly on Facebook, Indian Muslims have been practically dehumanized and rendered helpless and voiceless,ï¿½?said Zafarul-Islam Khan, a former chairman of Delhi Minorities Commission, speaking at a press briefing organized by Facebook critics known as the Real Facebook Oversight Board. Meta had commissioned law firm Foley Hoag in 2020 to carry out an independent review of its impact in India ï¿½?the companyâs largest market[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/23/technology/facebook-india-misinformation.html#:~:text=With%20340%20million%20people%20using,is%20the%20company%27s%20largest%20market.] at 340 million users ï¿½?but its release has repeatedly been delayed, activists allege. In November, rights groups told the Wall Street Journal that the social media company had narrowed the draft reportâs scope and was delaying the process of releasing it. Calls for more information on how hate speech plays out on Meta platforms in India intensified when Haugen leaked internal documents in 2021 showing how the the company struggles to monitor problematic content in countries with large user bases. The papers revealed in particular how users in India were inundated with fake news, hate speech including anti-Muslim posts and bots interfering with elections. These papers underscored an ongoing critique that the company does not allocate proportional resources to its larger, non-English markets. Haugen revealed in her papers and testimony to Congress that Facebook has earmarked only 13% of its global misinformation budget to non-US countries, though Americans make up just 10% of its active daily user base. Such funding issues are particularly stark in countries like India, which has 22 official languages, said Teesta Setalvad, an Indian civil rights activist and journalist, in a press conference on Wednesday. âFacebook allows unchecked inciting content that has become an instrument for targeting minorities, Dalits and women in India,ï¿½?she said. Facebookâs director of human rights policy, Miranda Sissons, said in a statement : âGiven the complexity of this work, we want these assessments to be thorough. We will report annually on how weâre addressing human rights impacts, in line with our Human Rights Policy.ï¿½?In their letter to Facebook, activists cited the UN guiding principles on business and human rights, which urge that companies should âbe prepared to communicate this externally, particularly when concerns are raised by or on behalf of affected stakeholdersï¿½? âFacebook knows its operations happen behind a veil,ï¿½?Haugen said. âBut when we speak to each other, we begin to see a larger, more comprehensive view. We must push for mandatory transparency.ï¿½?âUnless Facebook is required to publish, India will not get the safety it deserves,ï¿½?she added. Reuters contributed to this report"

364,0,"From snow-trekking to igloo-building and Moonbiking, itâs time to head off-piste",1803 words,sundaytimes.co.uk,"âIt was crazy busy,ï¿½?he said. âWe were worked off our feet. I really couldnât complain.ï¿½?Wait. What? The thing I hadnât considered was that last year the ski lifts were ordered to close but there was nothing to stop people driving up to the ski resorts to get fresh air into their lungs and have fun in the snow. The only activities open to them were those that didnât require mechanical ski-lifts and this has led to a veritable explosion of interest in off-piste activities. Some of these have been around for ever, such as snow-trekking, ski touring and cross-country skiing, while others are relatively new, such as fat-biking and the latest French trend, Moonbikes. Meanwhile, management at the resorts found themselves twiddling their thumbs on a subsistence wage, so they ended up spending a lot of time looking at their offerings and getting a bit more creative. In just about every ski resort, this phenomenon was repeated. Over in Val dâIsÃ¨re, about 50km to the east of La Plagne, ChloÃ© HarlÃ© of the tourist office talked of how one upside of the lockdown was that it allowed them to reflect on the nature and offer of their resort, and look at ways to improve their range of services. It also allowed time for hotels and restaurants to renovate and dress in their best colours for when the tourists would return to the slopes. And with ski stations being very much on the front line when it comes to global warming, the pandemic also allowed resorts time to beef up their environmental policies. Back in on the trail in La Plagne with Philippe, meanwhile, weâre crossing a busy piste. Ski slopes can be a bit tricky to negotiate when youâre not used to them and I squint my eyes in the bright sunshine. It feels as if Iâm trying to traverse a motorway and I canât really tell how fast people are whizzing down the mountain, so I just follow Philippe, ensuring I stay slightly downhill of his position so that in the event of the worst coming to the worst and a skier crashing into us, heâll cushion the impact. Anyway heâs an expert so itâs not going to happen. Weâre wearing snowshoes or, as the French much more accurately describe them, raquettes . Once weâre on the other side of the piste, weâre in a winter wonderland ï¿½?a real one, untouched by humans since the previous nightâs heavy snowfall. Itâs all soft white curves and quiet, and we follow in Philippeâs assured footsteps, stepping into the deep snow sometimes up to our knees but knowing that it goes much deeper. âItâs like a 4x4 for your feet,ï¿½?he says, pointing out that the snowshoe spreads your bodyweight over an area five times larger than youâd otherwise have. The only trick is to ensure to stay upright. A fall in deep snow is hard to get up from ï¿½?both due to the physical struggle involved and the helpless laughing it precipitates. Another unique feature of this part of the world, Philippe points out to me, is the existence of a pine tree that grows only out of the rocks. What? I ask. Right in front of me, there it is ï¿½?a tall, proud, strong pine tree that is rooted in the rock. âLook, there are some over there too,ï¿½?he says, and I turn around to see that half the trees surrounding me are also growing out of the rock, splitting the stone as they get bigger. It is all down to one bird, he says. Without this bird, the tree wouldnât exist, and maybe without the tree the bird wouldnât exist. Who knows? In any case, the bird has a habit of storing up the seeds from these trees in crevices in the rock, in the manner of a squirrel or, say, a Cavan man. For a variety of possible reasons, the bird doesnât return to claim his booty from some of those crevices and, when that happens, the seeds begin to sprout in their hidden rocky enclave and grow into mighty fine trees. The aforementioned Moonbiking is a new off-piste highlight that I, for one, would like to do again and again. Itâs a bit like an electric-scooter version of the snowmobile. Next to it, the noisy petrol-burning engine of the latter looks trÃ¨s passÃ© in our ecologically minded present. Conceived and built locally at Annecy ï¿½?though disguised as an American idea with its name and labelling entirely in English ï¿½?the Moonbike gives you one hell of a thrill-ride over the slopes and through the fields of off-piste virgin snow. At the back of this âbikeï¿½?is a caterpillar track while at the front is a ski in place of a wheel. You steer by leaning left or right rather than by turning the handlebars. Itâs tricky, but you soon get the hang of it and before you know it, youâre whooping with delight in the Alpine night air, tearing up the snowy hillside on a cool âsnowpedï¿½?that sounds like an electric rotavator. Thereâs also been a recent explosion in the art of igloo-building on the French slopes. Itâs a great exercise in teamwork and tremendous knockabout fun. We were four in all ï¿½?me, my son, local tourism rep SÃ©verine and our jovial team leader and former elite mountain infantry soldier Guillaume. We built a small one that just about accommodated a grown man sitting down with his legs crossed. At other resorts, the idea is taken to another level. At Chamrousse, for example, you can dine, warm your cockles with vin chaud and sleep overnight in an igloo. This is a resort that has achieved the Flocon Vert label, distinguishing it as having achieved a high level of sustainability. More and more French ski resorts have this âgreen snowflakeï¿½?stamp of approval firmly in their sights. In tandem with becoming more eco-friendly and widening their off-piste offer to an increasingly discerning winter-holidaying public, some French resorts have been taking a change of direction; rejigging their image in the face of a changing world. Such is the case with Courchevel. Long perceived as the kind of place where Russian or British millionaires like to roll up in their gleaming Jeeps wearing designer ski clothing, the resort is now firmly moving from World Bling Capital to World Ski Capital. Next year, it will be hosting the World Ski Championships and, according to Romain Delasselle, a local tourism representative, it has all the facilities necessary to underpin its reputation for those who like to aim for the highest sporting standards. Similar to its neighbour Courchevel, La Plagne is made up of a series of villages, all of them purpose-built at different stages. This spreading out has helped to keep the resort reasonably quiet and low-key, feeling much smaller and cosier than it actually is. In many ways, itâs a great place to get back to the slopes because it offers a wide range of skiing without the feeling of being in an overly busy super-resort. In fact, La Plagne is large and has some 225km of slopes; it was named the worldâs most popular ski resort in 2014. It is also connected by gondola to both Peisey-Vallandry and Les Arcs, making it part of the enormous Paradiski area, with more than 425km of piste. If youâre here for a week, however, youâve more than enough to keep you going without having to go elsewhere. Planning a trip to la plagne?

481,0,Recall workers before it's too late,810 words,National Post,"But with the lifting of capacity limits comes another warning to employers: recall employees to the workplace before it's too late. Although some sectors, such as tech, have embraced remote work and shifted to that model permanently, many employers are patiently waiting for their empty offices to be filled. We wrote on this topic in October, when we cautioned that permitting employees to work from home longer than legally necessary risked making that a permanent term of their employment. In such a scenario, an employee who was later forced back to the office could claim the move amounted to a constructive dismissal, refuse to attend and sue for wrongful dismissal if the employer did not back down. That was two lockdowns and two waves of COVID ago. The news that the latest lockdown is coming to an end makes it now opportune for employers to advise employees that they are required to return to work. Some tips to remember are: ? The time to recall employees to the office is limited. The sooner employers act, the less likely an employee can claim constructive dismissal. If employers act quickly enough and employees refuse to return to the office, they have abandoned their employment. ? Employers should document these communications: a phone call is not sufficient protection. ? And finally, if remote work is the new norm, employers should offer new contracts that include workfrom-home rules. Employers legally have a choice of offering employees their jobs back at the office at their existing remuneration but offering a lesser amount if they prefer to work from home. With a shortage of workers though, that may not be practical. Many employers will fail to address these issues and 2022 may just become the year of ""return-to-work"" constructive dismissal claims, just as 2020 was with COVID-19 layoffs and 2021 with vaccine mandates. As with those other claims, the employer's timing and proper documentation will play a key role in deciding whether employees will receive an award of damages. Employers should not view the Jan. 20 announcement as just another false alarm, but rather, take Premier Ford at his word and act accordingly Many employers who failed to properly handle temporary layoffs and vaccine policies have spent a considerable amount in damages and legal fees over the past two years. Employment lawyers have moved from niche practitioners to some of the most in-demand legal specialists due to these kinds of policy errors by employers. Some employee-side law firms have even instituted bonuses based on the number of claims filed by associates each month. At our firm, when acting for employers, we are receiving fewer demand letters Instead, employer clients are being served statements of claim without warning. Many of these claims could have been avoided. It is never too late to get your business's documents up to date and in order. Drafting contracts that will survive judicial scrutiny is the first step. With so much uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, employers are well-advised to determine now their intentions as to which employees will be permanently granted work-from-home status and to provide instructions and documentation accordingly. And to be clear: It is the employer's right to decide which employees that will be - provided they act quickly. Financial Post Got a question about employment law during COVID-19?

758,0,"Fact check: News is broadcast live on Russian TV, no evidence antiwar protest was fake",1454 words,USA Today Online,"Russian state-owned media outlets have for weeks presented an alternate reality of the invasion of Ukraine, characterizing the war as a âpeacekeeping operationï¿½?and pushing disinformation. Online, some claim a Russian producer's antiwar protest during a live evening newscast was just another propaganda stunt. âThere are no live on-air television broadcasts in Russia. None. Ever,ï¿½?reads a March 15 Facebook post that generated more than 400 interactions within six days. âLike most of the world, I saw the video of the âbrave Russian womanï¿½?yesterday. On the one hand I thought, âoh, wow, amazingï¿½? But at the same time, there was something that felt off.ï¿½?On March 14, Marina Ovsyannikova interrupted a live broadcast from the Channel One network in Moscow by holding a sign reading ""No War"" in English. She was later detained and taken into custody, according to the human rights group OVD-Info. Following her arrest, Ovsyannikova was questioned for 14 hours and appeared in court. She was released and charged with âdiscrediting the Russian Armed Forces,"" according to Pavel Chikov, a Russian human rights lawyer representing her. Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks The user who published the Facebook post, Texas-based singer-songwriter Bria Blessing, questioned how Ovsyannikova gained access to the studio with a large poster, her ânonchalant, almost playfulï¿½?body language and the lack of reaction from the news anchor sitting at the desk. âThe answer - it was all staged. Itâs now come out that the whole thing was fake,ï¿½?Blessing wrote, pointing to a 2015 article from The Guardian about the Kremlinâs information warfare. Similar versions of the claim circulated on Facebook and Twitter, where some members of Ukraine's parliament shared it. But there are live broadcasts on state-owned Russian TV channels, according to independent fact-checking organizations. Media and disinformation experts say the post isn't evidence the demonstration was fake. USA TODAY reached out to the Facebook users who shared the claim for comment. News is broadcast live in Russia Vera Tolz, a professor of Russian studies at the University of Manchester, said in an email that there had been live TV news broadcasts in Russian until at least March 17, noting that state-owned channels modified their approach to broadcasting in response to the protest. âHistorically, all major newscasts are âclean liveï¿½?because news could happen during the show and the importance may require immediate reaction from an anchor,"" Vasily Gatov, a Russian media analyst and senior fellow at the University of Southern Californiaâs Annenberg Center, told USA TODAY in an email. Fact check roundup: What's true and what's false about the Russian invasion of Ukraine He pointed to and translated a March 15 Facebook post from his friend and former Channel One news anchor Yulia Pankratova, who wrote that the networkâs evening news broadcast always airs live, without even a one-minute delay. Marek Bekerman, a lecturer in international journalism at the University of Salford in the United Kingdom, said in an email that while itâs easy to deceive audiences into believing a pre-recorded item is live, it would be difficult to do so âon a continuous basis over a period of time for a news-oriented outlet.ï¿½?He said itâs also ânot practicalï¿½?or necessary for the purposes of Russian propaganda or disinformation. âThere is no logical connection between this incident and the coverage of the civilian deaths or atrocities in the conflict,ï¿½?Bekerman said. âClaiming that the protest on Russian television distracts attention away from events on the ground verges on paranoia ï¿½?if anything, it brings it in a sharper focus.ï¿½?More: President Biden uses presidential power to give additional $800 million to Ukraine Adrian Campbell, an associate professor at the University of Birmingham in the U.K., said if the news wasn't broadcast live, it would have been reflected in reporting of the incident from independent Russian news outlets, such as Meduza. Studio access isn't unusual, protester could face further prosecution Social media users expressed skepticism that Ovsyannikova was able to interrupt the broadcast and get through security. But Russian media experts say it isn't unusual for a producer to have studio access. ""Ovsyannikova's social media shows that she had been a long-time employee of the television network,"" Sarah Oates, a professor at the University of Maryland who researches Russian propaganda, said in an email. ""Television production works in Russia very much the way it does in the west ï¿½?trusted employees are often near the set and have full access."" Ovsyannikova used her employee ID badge to pass through two security check points and âbreezed past a final guardï¿½?at the studio door, according to the Wall Street Journal. Pankratova, the former Channel One news anchor, said in the Facebook post that when she worked for the network, security guards were in place. But employees such as editors or makeup artists could show a pass to gain access. Further, the $280 fine some social media users have pointed to is related to a video Ovsyannikova posted online before the protest, not for her performance during the live broadcast, BBC reported. Media experts and news reports indicate Ovsyannikova could face further prosecution and imprisonment under a new Russian law, which punishes anyone who uses âwarï¿½?or âinvasionï¿½?to describe the conflict with up to 15 years in prison. Other assertions that the protest was staged surfaced online as well, including in a post from Larissa Doroshenko, a teaching associate specializing in disinformation at Northeastern University. It illustrates the lack of consensus over the nature of the Russian protest. In the March 15 post, Doroshenko said she believed the protest was staged based on the reaction of the anchor and the lack of a more severe punishment for Ovsyannikova, who remained free and able to give interviews. Doroshenko, though she didnât provide direct evidence the incident was staged, told USA TODAY in an email that she believes it was orchestrated to âemphasize that ordinary Russians are against the war and are suffering from sanctions, as well as that only Putin is to blame for this war.ï¿½?She said Russian media has staged protests in the past. Fact check: Ukrainian boxer auctioned Olympic medal in 2012, not during Russian invasion Our rating: False Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that a protest during a Russian news broadcast was staged because ""there are no live on-air television broadcasts in Russia.""

953,0,âGovt. order on closure a slow death for restaurant industryï¿½?302 words,The Hindu,"The order issued by the Delhi government on Monday prohibiting dining at restaurants and allowing only deliveries is unsustainable and will lead to a slow death of an erstwhile vibrant industry, said the National Restaurant Association of India. It urged the government to provide the industry with some âoxygenï¿½?to survive the closure. All restaurants and bars in the city, which had so far been running at 50% capacity and with restricted operating hours, were ordered to be closed in view of the rise in COVID-19 cases. Kabir Suri, president of NRAI, said the guidelines came at a time when restaurants had just about started seeing a respectable surge in consumption, which promp-ted the industry to hire back staff who had lost jobs. âWe are very worried about the fate of 3,01,715 people employed in Delhi restaurants. We donât want them to suffer but unfortunately, we donât have adequate resources to support them for long. Over 25% of restaurants were shut last year and more than 24 lakh people lost their jobs nationally. These new guidelines are going to be even further detrimental to the industry,ï¿½?Mr. Suri said. He said it is disheartening to see that the restaurant industry, which operates in a safe and closed environment, is being asked to shut while some other activities like airlines, transport and markets continue to function. âWe need some urgent oxygen for our survival. I urge the Delhi government to either allow us to operate in normal hours with safeguards, or compensate us, our employees, suppliers and landlords suitably for the loss of business resulting from the lockdown,ï¿½?Mr. Suri said.",
729,1,Vehicles Sales Increase By 19.4 Percent in March,245 words,AllAfrica,"In March 2022, vehicle sales were dominated by Toyota (47.5%), Volkswagen (13.2%), Nissan  (5.6%), Ford (4.4%) and KIA (4.2%). Simonis Storms economist, Theo Klein said the strong local demand for new vehicles could be a result of the N$13 billion paid in life insurance claims between the second quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2021. ""This is potentially one explanation for the strong local demand for new vehicles, creating major backlogs for certain brands as discussed earlier. This can also potentially explain why growth in instalment credit for households has been moderate to stagnant as well,"" Klein said. Klein said Namibian consumers can expect car prices to continue rising in 2022 in addition to higher costs of operating vehicles, such as higher fuel and spare parts prices. ""In a rising interest rate environment, we do also expect slightly lower demand for car loans,"" Klein added."
214,1,UAE: Ministry warns against recruiting domestic workers from unlicensed agencies,736 words,Gulf News (Dubai),"The ministry has warned people in the UAE about âunlicensed recruitment agencies, including unreliable social media pages, that promote the services of these category of workersï¿½? The hiring family can contract infectious diseases if the hired worker was ill as unlicensed agencies will not take measures to ensure the workersï¿½?medical fitness. On the other hand, dealing with approved recruitment agencies guarantees the rights of all parties in accordance with the Domestic Workers Law and its Executive Regulations. âProtecting the rights of all partiesï¿½?The ministry recently issued a decree that allows private recruitment agencies to offer domestic workers on hire, provided they obtain a licence after meeting certain conditions. The ministry said that dealing with licensed agencies will protect the rights of all parties. Domestic workers in the UAE primarily come from Philippines, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Nepal and India. The ministry has signed a memorandum of understanding with the countries that the workers come from in order to control the recruitment process and guarantee the rights of all parties. A periodic review of fees will also be done according to the recruitment costs of each of these countries. Recruitment packages Licensed recruitment offices offer different packages for recruitment of workers. Traditional package: The worker is registered on the employerâs records and resides with him or her during the contract period of two years, which is the period during which the recruitment office guarantees the employer the services of the domestic worker. This package allows the employer to replace the worker or recover the cost of recruitment in the event of any of the following cases during the first six months of the employment term: ï¿½?If the worker terminates the contract without a legitimate reason. ï¿½?If the worker quits without an acceptable reason. ï¿½?If there are fitness-related issues with the worker. ï¿½?If the worker is unable to carry out the contracted task in the manner agreed. Temporary package: Where a trained and qualified assistant worker is provided within 24 hours and this worker is registered with the recruitment office for a contractual period of two years, during which, the worker is not allowed to move with the employer. Flexible package: This provides a domestic worker registered with the recruitment office to work under a flexible system (hours-days-weeks-months) and the cost of recruitment depends upon the type of employment. This package has a set of benefits, including the provision for qualified and trained domestic workers. The number of replacements is not specified. The ministry has developed services such as cancellation and renewal of residence permits of domestic workers and registration of complaint about interruption of services. Wages through WPS The services can be obtained through the ministryâs website, the ministryâs smart application and by calling the toll-free number 80060. âThe employer can complete any of the services such as cancellation or renewal of the residence permit of the domestic worker or register a complaint for interruption of work through the smart application of the ministry, without the need to enter the password and user name,ï¿½?said the ministry. The ministry has called upon employers to pay the wages of domestic workers through the Wage Protection System (WPS), as the system allows them to pay wages on time in the easiest way in a manner that preserves their right to prove the payment process. Direct cash transfers WPS, which is optional, allows employers to pay wages to employees and domestic workers through the system, by way of direct cash transfers to banks, through money exchange houses that provide the service and that are registered with and approved by the UAE Central Bank, or through the smart applications of these agencies. The system includes all domestic worker categories, including sailors, housekeepers, cooks, guards, private drivers, shepherds, groomers, falconers, workers, housekeepers, farmers, gardeners, private trainers, private teachers, private nurses, special representatives and private agricultural engineers."

595,1,"Treading Cautiously, Developers Ramp Up New Seniors Housing Projects",758 words,Wealth Management,"âWeâve seen developers engage multiple market studies, typically two or three per a project, instead of relying on a single report for a âgoï¿½?or âno-goï¿½?decision,ï¿½?says James Graber, managing director of valuation and advisory services and leader of the Seniors Housing and Healthcare practice for CBRE. Many seniors housing properties have struggled to rent units in recent years. The seniors housing development pipeline was chugging along, fueled by demographic trends generating more than sufficient demand. Then the coronavirus pandemicâwith the terrible toll it took on elderly Americansâwreaked havoc with the sector. Between fatality rates and a slowdown in move-ins, just 81 percent of units were occupied in the fourth quarter of 2021, according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care (NIC MAP). Thatâs down from a high of 88.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. âDevelopers are more sensitive to market dynamics, and less willing to âpushï¿½?a project that shows limited feasibility,ï¿½?says CBREâs Graber. Developers are also testing markets for the availability of a workforce[https://www.wealthmanagement.com/seniors-housing/biden-keep-pushing-nursing-homes-staffing-level-rules]. Many seniors housing properties now struggle to hire enough staff, and often have to hire expensive temporary staff from agencies. âCosts and increased operating expenses will have an impact on your ultimate stabilized yield and IRR so itâs important to be as accurate as possible,ï¿½?says Austin Sacco, co-head of national senior housing for CBRE. Developers start construction on new seniors projects Despite these worries, leasing activity is picking up[https://www.wealthmanagement.com/seniors-housing/seniors-housing-sales-activity-likely-pick-second-half-2021] and developers having started building again. âConstruction began to pick up again in primary markets after a significant pandemic-related slowdown in 2020,ï¿½?says Brian Chandler, managing director and co-lead for the Seniors Housing Practice at JLL. Developers started building properties totaling 8,204 beds on where the majority of beds will be independent living[https://www.wealthmanagement.com/seniors-housing/senior-housing-s-new-new-thing] in 2021, up from less than 6,000 in 2020, according to NIC MAP. They also started building properties totaling 9,648 beds where the majority of bed will be assisted living, up from close to 7,000 the year before. Itâs a substantial amount of new construction. The new units under construction equaled 4.8 percent of existing inventory at the end of 2021 in primary and secondary markets, according to JLL. But itâs still a lot less than the number of units under construction at the last peak at the end of 2019, which was 7 percent of the existing inventory. Lenders provide financing for new construction Despite these worries, most developers can find financing to start building. âThere is still a significant amount of liquidity in the sector and a home for most transactions,ï¿½?says CBREâs Sacco. Interest rates from bank lenders are still relatively lowâoften floating between 250 to 350 basis points over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, experts say. âThe interest rate environment has been volatile as a result of ongoing geopolitical issues,ï¿½?says Sacco. âFrom a spread perspective, today youâre likely looking at a range of high 2âs to mid 3âs.ï¿½?Most developers will have to accept more risk by taking out recourse loans that come with a repayment guarantee. The most common structure for new construction is a loan that covers 65 percent of the cost of construction with a modest guaranty of 15 to 30 percent that typically burns off fully as the property begins to earn income and reaches certain performance hurdles, says Sacco. âNon-recourse construction financing is hard to come by unless you have an established track record reflecting successful on-time and on-budget projects,ï¿½?says Sacco. Typically, non-recourse loans cover between 55 percent and 57 percent of the cost of construction, says Sacco. Private equity debt funds are also eager to finance construction. Their loans cover 65 to 70 percent of the cost of construction. âThe catch with debt funds is that a loan typically needs to be $50 million or more to transact,ï¿½?says Sacco."

And at this moment, I would like to pass the floor on to Mr. Takis Arapoglou, the Chairman of the Board of Tsakos Energy Navigation. EFSTRATIOS-GEORGIOS A. ARAPOGLOU, INDEPENDENT CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, TSAKOS ENERGY NAVIGATION LIMITED: Thank you, Nicolas. Good morning and good afternoon to all. Thank you for joining our call today. The results we published today demonstrate the continued operating resilience of TEN in historically very weak markets that prevailed throughout 2021 and operating performance clearly far superior to our competition. This allows us to continue our confident path with great conviction and propose a dividend as we have done since inception in an uninterrupted fashion. We are currently experiencing very firm market conditions, which are not based on fundamentals. This is clearly an event-driven situation generated by both a surging post-pandemic economy and its inflationary and supply chain repercussions as well as by the admittedly quite sad war and humanitarian disaster in the Ukraine, affecting the world in more ways than one. It is still too early to say whether the current recovery is transitory and for how long or to any extent more permanent in nature. But in any case, we consider it as a welcome bridge towards the long-awaited recovery in the tanker market based on strong industry fundamentals. For this, TEN, through its well-structured operating model, is perfectly positioned to benefit from as it is indeed benefiting from already, reflected and acknowledged, as you are all aware, by the recent rise in the stock price. So congratulations once again for Nikolas Tsakos and his team and best wishes for continued success in 2022, and thanks again. And over to you, Nikolas Tsakos. Thank you.  NIKOLAS P. TSAKOS, FOUNDER, CEO, PRESIDENT & EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, TSAKOS ENERGY NAVIGATION LIMITED: Chairman, thank you very much and good morning to all of you from New York City where actually we had the opportunity to be on the New York Stock Exchange and celebrate our 20th anniversary as a quoted company here 20 years of continuous growth, as the Chairman said, and continuous dividend payments. However, looking back in the 2021, which was the worst tanker rate year in recent memory, more than 30 years ago, we had similar rates. We started the new year with enthusiasm looking forward for a post-COVID opening up environment that makes transportation like other services flourish. And whilst we were starting feeling the positive changes, we had the unprecedented events of February, end of February with the Russian invasion. So we started the last 2 years, every morning we were starting by making sure how to protect our seafarers and our crew and our vessels from the pandemic. I think we have a small break over couple of weeks, and now we're there trying to protect again our seafarers, our crew, our vessels from the difficult situations faced within the -- after the Russian invasion. But as the Chairman said, TEN is a company built on difficult situations. So we have a model that is able to pass through the hurdles and come out stronger. Counting, this is -- since inception, this is our fifth crisis starting with the Paris crisis in '96. The events followed the 9/11. Then of course the Lehman crisis, COVID, and without interruption, the Russian invasion. But we keep a steady hand to the wheel. We navigate the waves. I think good seafarers are only become good when they have to go through storms, and this is what we do. Right now, we are enjoying what we have prepared the company with, with 40 vessels out of our 71 on spot or profit-selling arrangements, every single $1,000 of spot market exposure have increased, $0.07 down to our bottom line. And we are experiencing the best rates since 2008 as we speak. So although none of us is happy with what is happening, actually, as our CEO, we'll play and hope that the atrocities will stop as fast as possible and the world will go to an open state, because shipping actually flourishes when we have open season, open borders. And we expect with the fundamentals that are out there, less than 8% across the part of the world, a newbuilding replacement program with many vessels exceeding their 15th of the 20th year anniversary and outnumbering by the first-time partly the additions to enjoy, hopefully, prosperous and peaceful couple of years going forward. But in the meantime, we have to navigate with difficulty, and that's what we do. We feel confident to maintain our dividend. And hopefully, if things continue, to have an increased dividend in the second half of the year. And with that, I will ask George Saroglou to give us a quick wrap of 2021, a very quick (inaudible) is not the year we want to remember and talk about the future. Thank you.  GEORGE V. SAROGLOU, COO, VP & EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, TSAKOS ENERGY NAVIGATION LIMITED: Thank you, Nikolas, and Good morning to all of you joining our earnings call today. Let's go to the slides of our presentation. Starting with Slide 3, we see that intent since inception. In 1993, we have faced 4 major crises, fifth now with the war. And each time the company, thanks to its tested counter-cyclical operating model, that targets growth of market lows has come out stronger. And of course, it's not exception this time. While we navigated the company through the challenges the COVID pandemic has created, we have managed to grow and prepare the company for its next phase. We announced newbuilding contracts for 4 dual-fuel LNG powered Aframax tankers against long-term employment to a major oil concern. Factoring the latest orders and considering the company's start in 1993, with 4 modern tankers, we currently have a pro forma fleet of 71 vessels for an annual growth of 15% in terms of deadweight tons. In next slide, we see the pro forma fleet as its current -- in a current employment profile. We have a combination of vessels in fixed time charters and flexible employment contracts, which means time charter with profit-sharing, contracts of affreightments and spot trading vessels that capture the market's upside. All dark blue color vessels, 26 in the slide, are on fixed rate time charters, while the light blue and red color vessels or about 61% of the fleet currently in the water have exposure in the market's upside. This means that TEN is well positioned to capture the positive tanker market fundamentals. In fact, we already witnessed better spot rates as the invasion of Russia in Ukraine, a tragic event, and the trade dislocations that it created has fuel spot rates to high levels. We took advantage of the low freight market environment in the last quarter and last year to bring forward a number of scheduled special surveys repairs to have these vessels ready once the freight market for tanker rebounds. Out of 21 special surveys last year, 12 were for vessels that were brought forward. Fleet modernity is a key element of our operating model. During last year, we sold 3 of our older tankers. And as we mentioned, we replaced them with a newbuilding order for 4 dual-fuel Aframax tankers that will enhance the company's environmental footprints as these LNG dual-fuel-powered vessels are the first such investments in the company's history. We are also building one more DP2 Shuttle Tanker for delivery at the end of the second quarter of this year. All remaining newbuildings are coming with long-term employment attached. We also took delivery in January of our newest LNG vessel, TENERGY. The vessel entered immediately a 5 year time charter that is expected to make contribution to our bottom line as the LNG sector is currently very strong. Inclusive of the above charters, TEN's minimum fixed revenue has a backlog that exceeds $1 billion. Moving into Slide 5, we see that the left side presents the all-in breakeven cost for the various vessel types that we operate in TEN. As you can see, we continue to have a low cost base. And during the year, the revenue generated from the time charter contracts was again sufficient to cover the company's cash expenses paid for the vessels' OpEx, overheads, chartering costs and loan interest. We must also highlight the purchasing power of Tsakos Columbia Shipmanagement and the continuous cost control efforts by management to maintain a low OpEx average for the fleet, while keeping the high fleet utilization rate quarter-after-quarter. Despite 21 special surveys during last year, we achieved an overall 92.6% utilization for the fleet. And thanks to the profit-sharing element, a cornerstone of TEN's chartering strategy, for every $1,000 per day increase in spot rates, we have a positive $0.33 impact in annual EPS based on the number of TEN vessels that currently have exposure to spot rates. Debt reduction is an integral part of the company's capital allocation, as we see in Slide 6. The company's debt peaked in December of 2016. Since then, we have repaid $380 million of debt and repurchased 100 million in 2 series of step-up preferred shares we had outstanding. In Slide 7, we see that in addition to paying down debt, dividend continuity is important for common shareholders and management. TEN has always paid the dividend irrespective of the market cyclicality. About $0.5 billion in dividend payments have been distributed since the New York Stock Exchange listing in 2002. The next dividend of $0.10 per share will be paid in June. Exact details of the payment will be announced during the company's first quarter '22 earnings call. Slide 8, global oil demand continues to recover. We had 6.8 million barrels per day increase last year as a result of the vaccination rollouts and gradual return of mobility and economic activity to levels flow to the pre-pandemic demand -- oil demand levels. Despite current headwinds, oil demand is expected to rise by another 2 million barrels in 2022, which means that based on the current forecast, we will be at the pre-pandemic oil demand levels during -- sometime during the second half of the year or latest by year end. On the global supply front, OPEC+ producers continue to manage supply with discipline. Some countries have not been able to meet their monthly quotas and underproducing. Global oil stocks continue to fall and are now 300 million barrels below the 5 year average. Non-OPEC production is set to rise in 2022. As a result of the war in Ukraine, we had a second coordinated effort to release in total approximately 214 million barrels from the strategic petroleum reserves of the United States and OECD member countries for the next 6 months in an effort to lower energy prices and counter-balance the effect the war has created in the energy markets. With oil demand recovering, let us look at the forecast for supply of tankers on Slide 9. The order book stands at around 5.6% or 285 tankers over the next 3 years, the lowest it has been in over 20 years. At the same time, a big part of the fleet is over 15 years. 30% of the fleet are in excess of 1,500 tankers. Almost 400 tankers or 7% of the fleet are currently over 20 years. Slide 10. As the next slide shows, 2018 was one of the highest scrapping years of records since -- with 22 million deadweight ton removed from the market. Last year, we've seen an acceleration of scrapping from the second half and ended with almost 15 million deadweight tons removed. Scrap prices continue to be at very high levels. With more environmental regulations coming, discussions for alternative fuels and 7.2% of the global fleet above 20 years, we expect scrapping activity to remain high and act as a balancing factor for fleet supply going forward. So to summarize, oil demand, the recovery continues. Oil supply, we've seen monthly production increases by OPEC. Non-OPEC production is set to increase in 2022, bringing more cargoes to the market at the time when global oil stocks are below the 5 year levels and demand is increasing towards the pre-COVID levels. Recent geopolitical events in Ukraine and the sanctions that followed for the large numbers of Russian state oil and privately held tankers to be excluded from the market as oil majors and oil traders boycotted these vessels, creating a supply squeeze in the Aframax and Suezmax sectors. As rates firm, we are seeing increased activity across the tanker board. Order book supply of tankers, the order book to current fleet ratio is at historical low levels. A big part of the fleet is reaching phase-outs age pointing to a tighter supply of tankers for the next 18 to 24 months. And if you look generally at TEN, we have a modern fleet, which is well positioned to capture the expected recovery of the market. We continue to reduce debt. We have a strong balance sheet, strong banking relationships that allow the company to take advantage of the opportunities that will be presented. And with that, I will ask Paul to walk you through the financial highlights of the fourth quarter and the year. Paul?  PAUL DURHAM, CFO & CAO, TSAKOS ENERGY NAVIGATION LIMITED: Hi, this is Paul. Can you hear me? NIKOLAS P. TSAKOS: Yes, Paul, we can hear you. Go ahead.  PAUL DURHAM: Okay. Well, I'll continue from where we lost George. There are several aspects to quarter 4 that contributed to a positive change in fortune in the tanker market, including higher TCE and a 6% increase in revenue. But also in quarter 4, management of TEN concluded, based on cash flow projections, that 7 of its oldest vessels had incurred non-cash impairment charges despite their excellent condition. This is also to our benefit. These charges totaled $86.4 million, a significant amount. But by incurring these charges, the vessel values will more accurately reflect current fair market values. In addition, quarterly depreciation charges, henceforth, will be reduced by $2.3 million in each of the following quarters. The quarter 4 financials were actually much in line with the 3 recent quarters, and excluding the impairments, resulted in a modest loss of just $14.9 million. In a difficult market, there was a 6% increase, as I've said, in revenue compared to the previous quarter 4 with total revenue reaching $139 million. And although annual revenue dipped from the prior year, can still achieved over $0.5 billion revenue in the year with almost full vessel employment, strongly indicating an improving market that we now see gathering pace. While tankers operating in the spot market struggled to cover daily OpEx, our average TCE was nearly $17,000 per day despite 6 vessels dry docking in quarter 4. Even with dry dockings and soaring bunker prices, total expenses increased by a manageable 9% after excluding current and prior year impairments. Vessel operating expenses fell by 3%, keeping daily operating expenses per ship at $7,900 helped by a stronger dollar, while G&A remained at $7.2 million. Our daily overheads remaining at a low $1,200 per vessel. Other expenses remained relatively stable compared to the prior quarter 4, including interest and finance costs, remaining at about $9 million in both fourth quarters as interest rates declined and positive bunker hedges helped provide some balance against the higher bunker costs. Generating adequate EBITDA and preserving cash reserves over the past year and especially in recent quarters has been a challenge given market conditions, although we managed to reduce debt in the year by $130 million and insured financing for the LNG carrier and for the forthcoming shuttle tanker and recent Aframax orders. All of these activities have put extra pressure on our liquidity. However, thanks to our time charter strategy and to refinancing by our banks, we successfully managed to -- managed our operational cash flow and fully met our debt service obligations. And to date, this year, we have bolstered our cash reserves to more healthy levels, helped by a promising market take-off, soon to be reinforced by a tanker sale with the prospect of further sales. And at this point, I'll finish my comments. Go back to Nikolas. NIKOLAS P. TSAKOS: Thank you, Paul. Thank you for giving us a very, I would say, rosy for the future, financial position that we always maintain. As you know, TEN has always kept a strong balance sheet through thick and thin. And if you go to the last 20 years, we're very proud with -- very proud of our banking relationships, very proud of the very low spread that we have charged for our debt when we grow the company with accretive transactions. And this has been done by consistency by -- as we have on dividend payment. Perhaps, we are one of the very few companies in our peer group that has never ever approached our banks for any sort of renegotiation, and I think this is appreciated in a huge way. But when we hear that spreads are going higher and when we hear the people, other colleagues of ours, are facing difficulties in finding finance, our treasury environment department out of London has a view of very supportive associate banks to help personal growth and in our projects, and thank you for accomplishing this. And hopefully, as we go forward, the -- since we have navigated the worst part of the storm, I think we will be able now to pay more time and dividend for our common shareholders also, together of course, without refers that have outperformed the market in a very big way. And with this, I would like to open the floor for any questions that we could be careful to answer. Questions and Answers OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from Christopher Robertson from Jefferies. CHRISTOPHER WARREN ROBERTSON, EQUITY ASSOCIATE, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I wanted to ask about the ATM activity during 4Q. I guess, can you comment on how much was raised from the common share issuance and versus the preferreds? And then any issuances done year-to-date, what remains under the ATM and what would trigger any further issuances there? NIKOLAS P. TSAKOS: Well, yes, as you see from the report, I think we had about $20 million of -- in amount in the fourth quarter. And I think the majority of that is from common shares, a very a small part of it has gone with the preferred. CHRISTOPHER WARREN ROBERTSON: And then any issuances done year-to-date during 2022? NIKOLAS P. TSAKOS: I think it's similar issuance which we will be reporting in a couple of weeks with our results. CHRISTOPHER WARREN ROBERTSON: And then in terms of the 4 dual-fuel Aframax newbuilds on order, can you talk about the contract duration against those, expected EBITDA contribution? And does they're still scheduled for delivery in 2023 through 2024? And can you talk about kind of the cadence of delivery there? NIKOLAS P. TSAKOS: Yes. I mean, this is -- thank you for hosting this question because it's a very important part of our strategy going forward. Back in 1993 when we were at almost 30 years ago when we started then, our aim was to end up the then century by the beginning of 2000 to be able to have a full double fleet. And that was, if you remember, that was helped at the time the new legislation following the open line. We were able to accomplish this on a timely mode. And when we entered the New York Stock Exchange in March of 2002, we came with 24 double vessels. Well, now we're undergoing a very similar exercise, although we're a bit older, but I think wiser I hope. So what we would like to do is by the end of this decade, by 2030, to have the vast majority, if not all, of our vessels of the future technology of energy carriers, which right now seems to be the U.S., which could be either the alternative fuel, it could be gas or ethanol going forward. And of course, hydrogen is in the way part of our mind and our technical and environmental committees are working on designs like that together with our long-term shipyards. So we look at this initial 5 to 10 year contracts as a start with a very predominant and very experienced end user, Equinor, to build those ships and start our process that we would like by 2030 to have it completely. We are looking at the returns. We look at it as a return on equity of this, so we look at on the high cubic feet. I mean, our main always target is in excess of 15%. But when we're doing new high quality projects, we will do anything between 10% and 15%. CHRISTOPHER WARREN ROBERTSON: You mentioned controlling OpEx cost inflation. So last year, the OpEx story was negatively impacted throughout the industry from COVID-related cost pressures. Do you see that aspect improving this year? And if so, where are the current cost pressures coming from in terms of expenses?  NIKOLAS P. TSAKOS: Well, as I think as George, our COO, mentioned, we would like to help, starting for all our seafarers onboard because they went to have very difficult 2021 and 2020, having to spent their numerous months extending the sea service to help the company onboard the ships. And in such a difficult environment, we were able to reduce operating expenses. I think this is really something that the Tsakos operating team, we will have to thank them because they really were able to achieve a task of reducing expenses in an environment of increased, as you see, inflation by almost in excess of 3% over the year. And that by bringing -- we also included there half dozen at least of special surveys of good work forward to have those ships ready to date where these very high rates that we are having and also many of dislocation expenses in which we have actually to navigate vessels even [VMCs] to places like the Philippines to change the crew. So we don't have -- in mind, we were able to reduce expenses and we want to thank the seafarers and the management of Tsakos technical team for achieving this for us. Going forward, of course, we are looking at an inflationary environment. However, having looking at the weak euro, I think this balances out at least for us. As you know, the majority of our expenses are (inaudible) paid in euro. And having a weak euro and the stronger dollar will help balance the inflationary trends. So I will not foresee other than the charter expenses which we are hedging a significant part of it an immediate negative effect at least for the first 6 months. OPERATOR: And the next question comes from the line of Magnus Fyhr from H.C. Wainwright. (Operator Instructions) And the next question comes from the line of Magnus Fyhr. MAGNUS SVEN FYHR, MD & SENIOR MARITIME ANALYST, H.C. WAINWRIGHT & CO, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Nick and team Tsakos, can you hear me? NIKOLAS P. TSAKOS: More than sufficient. MAGNUS SVEN FYHR: Just a curious question on the Green fleet initiative. It sounds like you're defining the Green fleet as dual-fueled. I mean, you do have some eco-ships in your fleet, but it's about 42 vessels that are built before 2013, which some significant fleet replacement over the next couple of years here to have a fully dual-fuel fleet. How do you -- from a capital allocation standpoint, how do you go about financing this? Should we assume long-term contracts or just selling old assets and replacing it with new given that your stock is trading at below NAV? NIKOLAS P. TSAKOS: Well, we hope by the time it is the road show to the U.S. to build NAV. I'm only joking, but thank you for your question. I think we are doing these transactions because it sounds for us sitting around the table and just talking about Green ships and it sounds more simply. It's a huge technical task. You very rightly say that we have at least half of our fleet is already of the eco design. And our technical team and environmental committee is doing a lot to actually implement from January 23, the new legislation that will reduce the footprint of even of our older ships and bring them to a much more environmentally friendly circumstances to be able to navigate way under the legislative tasks that we are facing. And by placing our fleet, we would only do it together with the end users at least for the first part. After we have a dozen fleets hold the dual-fuel technology, a dozen vessels, and that will make us comfortable operating. Then we will be able to start [getting ships] even without employment. So it's not so much the risk, the financial risk is what we want also to take care of is the technical risk, but we are together with big major oil companies are getting the right ship for the right period and for the years to come. MAGNUS SVEN FYHR: Equinor seemed to be on the forefront of this. Are you having other conversations with other oil companies? And have you seen some change here over the last year as far as the appetite for financing these through long-term contracts? NIKOLAS P. TSAKOS: Yes. I think we're seeing also European and American companies, at least we have offers to bring another 10 vessels for 2 similar companies with 7 to 15-year employment profiles. MAGNUS SVEN FYHR: Just one last question. Rates have been very volatile here over the last month. Can you talk a little bit about the first quarter, what you've seen so far versus end of March vis-a-vis the fourth quarter? Maybe just talk about maybe Suezmaxes and Aframaxes on the crude and perhaps for once? NIKOLAS P. TSAKOS: Well, I think for a change and I think without taking care of all the, I would say, all the issues, impairments and non-cash items in 2021, I think we will be returning to a significant profit in the first quarter. And if things continue the way are today in an even better profit for the first 6 months. And of course, we're still in the middle or the beginning of the second quarter, but these rates, as you know, the rate is not the secrets are quite significant from the Aframaxes to the product carriers and the Suezmaxes all of them, regardless of the Russian crisis, regardless of Russian location, the whole market is very positive. So we believe that this could be the game changer. But you and I and the rest of the analysts we've been talking and the rest of our peer group for the last 18 months. MAGNUS SVEN FYHR: And I mean the spot rates have moved up here, would this be a time where your clients, the oil companies would try to lock in some vessels may be at higher rates, but maybe just secure tonnage? I mean, we still have some tonnage out there, but we see an appetite for time charters improving? NIKOLAS P. TSAKOS: There is a part to shape a very large appetite of first-class charters and traders and try and not to lose the boat literally in this case. So they were offering deeper rates in January, at 15% higher, in February it's higher, in March even higher now. And I think it is getting to a level that we can see a significant retention we might log a couple of ships. We have a very large portfolio to be able to take some on the spot and some on longer term protection. OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)  NIKOLAS P. TSAKOS: Well, I don't see we have any more questions. And I would ask our Chairman will give us his closing remarks. And we want to wish everybody Happy Easter from here from New York. And looking forward to for all of us to enjoy a peaceful holiday period this week and the next week (inaudible). And hopefully, we will be able to be reporting higher dividends and higher returns in our (inaudible) call, and hopefully, all is going to be settled hopefully in a peaceful way. And with that, I will ask our Chairman, Takis Arapoglou for his closing remarks. EFSTRATIOS-GEORGIOS A. ARAPOGLOU: Thank you, Nikolas. I have nothing else to say. I just wish you good luck and safe travels and hope you have a very productive road show in New York. Good bye from me. NIKOLAS P. TSAKOS: Thank you very much. Thank you, sir. Thank you.

33,1,Wawa has plan for expansion; CEO says firm envisions more drive-throughs.,399 words,The Philadelphia Inquirer,"Wawaâs drive-through locations have a smaller, limited menu based on the storeâs most popular offerings. Prepackaged, grab-and-go snacks (such as Tastykakes) and items like gallons of milk arenât available. âThe drive-through is primarily about convenience and speed of service, and if we made the entire offer available it would be hard to be able to meet the metrics for speed of service and convenience,ï¿½?Michael Sherlock, Wawa senior vice president and chief marketing officer, told The Inquirer when it opened its first drive-through in New Jersey in 2020. The drive-through expansion plan follows a similar trajectory to the brandâs expansion overall. Wawa first opened its doors in Folsom, Delaware County, in 1964. From there, it moved into New Jersey and Delaware, and in just under 15 years, 200 Wawa stores were open throughout the region, later creeping into Virginia and Maryland. The company made its biggest leap in 2012 when it opened its first store in Florida. As the store continued to grow its presence in the Sunshine State, first in the Orlando area and later around Miami, localsï¿½?reactions have ranged from excitement to indifference, with one person in 2019 calling it âjust a cool gas station.ï¿½?Across the Philly region ï¿½?Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware ï¿½?and throughout Washington, Virginia, and Florida, Wawa has 965 stores, the Journal reports.

635,0,PM to ask CRTC to review Russian news channel's âpresence on Canadian airwaves',736 words,The Globe and Mail,"State Department report last month. âThe CRTC is an independent body and we will be asking them to begin the process to review Russia Today's presence on Canadian airwaves,"" Mr. Trudeau said on Monday, referring to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. He added that âthe rigorous process is important when it comes to the independence of media in our country."" RT is included in a list nonCanadian channels authorized for distribution. If it were to be removed from that list, TV providers would not be permitted to carry it in the future. âThe CRTC has received complaints about RT from citizens and is analyzing the situation,"" spokesperson Eric Rancourt wrote in an e-mail. âWe are also aware of the Prime Minister's comments and are awaiting further information."" For years, RT's priority has been to secure the widest distribution possible, including in Canada. While many cable channels make money by earning a per-subscriber fee from distributors, RT did not charge one. In 2017, The Globe and Mail reported RT paid some major Canadian TV providers to carry the channel. In other cases, RT provided the signal for free. This meant many Canadians received the channel automatically in their TV packages, until the decisions this weekend to pull it off the air. Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong said on Monday that he believes there should be more transparency around such deals. âI think the cabinet should issue an order to the CRTC requiring Canadian TV providers to disclose payments they receive from foreign state-controlled broadcasters,"" Mr. Chong said. âIn an age of disinformation, transparency and information are effective ways counter propaganda from authoritarian states."" Rogers, Shaw and Telus did not respond to questions on Monday about whether they received payments from RT for carriage, and how many households received the channel before it was pulled. Bell declined to provide that information. Independent Toronto-based telecom VMedia, which announced it was also pulling the channel on Monday, said it received RT for free. The CRTC's Mr. Rancourt wrote in his e-mail that the regulator does not disclose information such as rates paid for carriage and other âcommercially sensitive information"" that is filed confidentially. Despite the changes to its TV distribution, RT's content is still available for free online to Canadians who seek it out, including on RT's own website and on YouTube, where some videos display the label, âRT is funded in whole or in part by the Russian government.""  YouTube, which is owned by Google parent company Alphabet Inc., has indefinitely suspended the ability for channels affiliated with Russian statefunded media, including RT, to make money from ads. âWe also significantly limited recommendations to several channels, including Russian channels affiliated with recent sanctions,"" YouTube spokesperson Lauren Skelly wrote in an emailed statement. âAnd in response to a government request, we've restricted access to RT and a number of other channels in Ukraine. We will continue to monitor new developments and may take further actions."" In his remarks, Mr. Trudeau highlighted âa significant amount of disinformation circulating from Russia, including on social media,"" during the crisis. The Russian embassy in Canada warned on Monday that Russia could retaliate with reciprocal countermeasures, but it did not specify what those would be. âIt's obvious discrimination against Russian media and also is a violation of the principle of the freedom of press and right of people to have access to the various sources of information in a pluralistic manner,"" the embassy said in a statement to The Globe. âIt shows that in Canada a right to different opinion can be undemocratically suppressed.""

934,0,Selena Gomez took a 'wonderful' break from social media: 'I've learned to have a balance with it',1159 words,USA Today Online,"Mavis and Johnny ""are a good onscreen couple. Relationship goals ï¿½?that's what you wanted me to say, right?"" jokes Samberg, 43, whose NBC sitcom ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" finished its eight-season run last year. For Gomez, 29, who stars in Hulu comedy ""Only Murders in the Building,"" saying goodbye to these films is ""so weird. Especially for me, in my 20s and now going on to 30s, it's really interesting to have grown up with this character. It's been such a delight."" Spoilers: 'Only Murders in the Building' uncovers a killer in shocking season finale The actors talk to USA TODAY about their friendship and more: Question: The two of you met while promoting the first movie. What did you initially bond over? Selena Gomez: Andy was really sweet. I was a little pipsqueak back then and he was making me laugh. And when weird questions would come up, he would deflect and it was very nice. I remember feeling very comfortable, like, ""This is fun."" Andy Samberg: It's interesting doing press with Selena. She gets a whole other variety of questions than I get ï¿½?it's been fascinating for me to see. She deals with it very gracefully, but man, I wouldn't trade. Q: In ""Transformania,"" Johnny feels that he needs to change himself in order to be accepted. Is that something either of you could relate to in your own lives? Gomez: Guilty. Maybe it's because of social media and the pressure. I definitely have felt like maybe I wasn't good enough or I should look a certain way. I had a hard time, but it's actually been four years for me without social media on my phone besides TikTok. So it's been wonderful. I still post and do what I do, but I've learned to have a balance with it and not let it consume me. Samberg: Everyone has (felt that way) at one point or another, it's just human nature. Especially when you're a kid and a teenager, you're trying to figure out who you are and where you fit in the world, and it's really easy to believe what other people tell you about yourself. But I certainly never thought I needed to change myself into a Godzilla monster. Q: Andy, has your daughter watched these films yet? (Samberg has a 4-year-old with his wife, musician Joanna Newsom.) Samberg: She's still a little too young, but I'm feeling really confident knowing I have four in the hopper. I actually made a choice to stop watching all the animated stuff over the last four years so that I would have it saved up to watch for the first time when she does start, so we can do it together. Gomez: Oooh, that's so sweet. Q: What are some movies that you're most excited to show her? Samberg: Dude, I haven't seen ""Moana"" or ""Coco"" or ""Encanto."" Those are the ones where I'm like, ""Oh, my God, I can't wait to see these movies. I've been waiting for four years!"" (Laughs.) It's going to be exciting. I was talking to my wife the other day about how I can't wait to watch ""E.T."" with her. Stuff like that where we're both like, ""Oh, we're going to cry!"" Q: Selena, congratulations on your first Grammy nomination (for Spanish-language EP ""RevelaciÃ³n,"" nominated for best Latin pop album). How did it feel to be recognized for music that is so personal to you? Gomez: I cried. (Laughs.) I was very excited. It's wonderful, I did not expect that at all. This is something I worked really hard on ï¿½?honestly, probably harder than any other album because I wanted to make sure that with it being Spanish that it's authentic, it sounds real, it's emotional and beautiful and poetic, which is what I love about Spanish music. I wanted it to be all of that, but it's really difficult not being completely fluent in the language. So there were times where it was really, really hard and I'm so proud of everyone that got to be a part of it. Q: You hinted in Vogue last year about potentially retiring from music. Could you still see that happening? Gomez: I think I just said it wrong. The idea of retirement for me isn't that I would leave forever, it is that I do see myself taking a significant break from music. Not personally ï¿½?I think I'll always be creating and doing music and hopefully maybe even do some side projects with people. I just want to maybe take a step back, but I'm not doing that anytime soon. A recipe for joy: How baking and craft shows helped me make it through another pandemic year Q: You both have food shows streaming right now (""Selena + Chef"" on HBO Max, hosted by Gomez, and ""Baking It"" on Peacock, co-hosted by Samberg). How do you think you'd fare as a ""Baking It"" contestant, Selena? Gomez: I'm horrible at baking. I don't know what to do, I just don't. The concept is crazy. I love cooking so that I can just throw things together. I'm not a great cook, either, but it's still fun. Samberg: You'd be a good host, that's all I do. I've probably baked 10 times in my life and I've enjoyed all 10 immensely. I wouldn't say I'm a professional baker ï¿½?more like a 10 times type. Q: Speaking of crossovers ï¿½?Andy, would you ever consider guesting on ""Only Murders in the Building"" Season 2? Samberg: Of course I'm interested, are you kidding? I already want to hang more with Selena, and Steve Martin and Martin Short are two of my absolute, all-time comedy heroes. That show is fantastic, so I'll do anything with any of them.

102,0,The Star may struggle to keep casino licence after shocking evidence,679 words,The Age - Online,"In February 2021, Crown was found unfit by the Bergin inquiry to hold its casino licence after Patricia Bergin confirmed allegations, first revealed by The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and 60 Minutes, that Crown had facilitated organised crime and money laundering due to appalling corporate governance. The public hearings into Star are looking at similar misconduct, unearthed in October by The Age and the Herald. It's no accident that Adam Bell, SC, is at the helm of The Star public probe. He was the quietly fearless and forensically ferocious counsel assisting Judge Bergin. It was Mr Bell who brought Crown's former executives and its main shareholder, James Packer, to their knees. The Crown allegations Mr Bell dissected are near identical to those facing Star and, at their heart, suggest a business culture that prioritised revenue over everything else, including the risk of enriching organised crime linked high-roller tour companies and VIP gamblers. On Monday, a Star financial manager, Paulinka Dudek, confirmed the practice first reported in The Age and the Herald in October that Star had for years run a system that disguised as ""hotel expenses"" what were in fact gambling funds. These gambling funds were smuggled out of China by high rollers. In pretending this money was for accommodation and other hotel expenses, Star ignored basic anti-money laundering procedures as it sought to help gamblers avoid China's strict capital flight and anti-gambling laws. The use of the same dishonest system by Crown prompted the royal commission in Victoria to describe the Melbourne casino as rotten. But where Crown disguised more than $160 million in this manner, the Bell inquiry on Thursday revealed that Star in Sydney pretended that at least $900 million were hotel expenses rather than gambling cash. Watching Dudek give evidence was excruciating, and not only because she was forced to admit her part in an unethical practice. Dudek, who appeared on the verge of tears at times, is small fry in the scheme of things. Dudek only became familiar with the long-running ""hotel expenses"" scheme in 2019, and her evidence strongly suggested she was simply following the orders of senior executives when she misled Star's banking partner about it. These executives will no doubt be grilled by Bell and his counsel assisting, Naomi Sharp, SC, and the claim that almost a billion dollars was disguised as hotel expenses suggests some executives may soon be looking for new jobs. Even more concerning is that a leaked KPMG audit, which was published as part of the October media expose of Star, made it clear that Star executives and board members were warned in 2018 that the casino's anti-money laundering controls were failing. When Star's dirty conduct was comprehensively detailed on the front page of this paper, it should have been apparent to Star's board, led by prominent sports and business figure John O'Neill, that the firm was in as much trouble as Crown. But, much like Crown's initial reaction to revelations of its wrongdoing, Star played down the media reports and hoped that other media outlets wouldn't bother doing their own digging. If the foolishness of this strategy wasn't made clear by Crown's experience, day one of the Bell inquiry has made it abundantly so.

The stock split will improve trading liquidity and make the stock more affordable. In a stock split, the number of outstanding shares will increase, and the price per share will come down proportionately. At the same time, the companyâs market capitalisation and the value remains the same since there is no issuance of additional shares. Shares of the company had rallied substantially with a series of acquisitions and the sharp spike in steel prices across the globe on the back of the Russia-Ukrine conflict. Tata Steel stocks had zoomed from an average price of ï¿½?,085 in January to ï¿½?,319 last Wednesday. Recently, Tata Steel Mining, the unlisted wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Steel, acquired a controlling stake of 90 per cent in Rohit Ferro-Tech under the approved Resolution Plan of ï¿½?17 crore under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016. Last month, it bought over ferroalloys producing assets of Odisha-based Stork Ferro and Mineral Industries for ï¿½?55 crore in an all-cash deal. The company, early this year, acquired the struggling Neelachal Ispat Nigam for ï¿½?2,100 crore. All these acquisitions will lead to additional revenue and a rally in the stock price in the coming days. It will be a sought reward for existing investors holding on to the stock through its difficult times, said an analyst."
643,0,"Demand for VPNs in Russia, Ukraine leaps as internet control tightens",324 words,Reuters News,"Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"", invaded its neighbour on Feb. 24, attacking from land, sea and air. At home, it is battling to control the narrative, threatening restrictions on foreign and local media that stray from its official version of events. Photos and videos were slow to load on Facebook, owned by Meta Platforms Inc, and Twitter, both of which have been targeted by state communications regulator Roskomnadzor. ""VPN demand surged in Russia as authorities restricted Facebook and Twitter over the weekend in a bid to control the flow of information from its invasion of Ukraine,"" Top10VPN said. Russia banned several VPNs last year, but has failed to block them entirely, as part of a wider campaign critics say stifles internet freedom. In Ukraine, Russian hackers were blamed for a spate of cyberattacks that briefly knocked Ukrainian banking and government websites offline, days before the invasion. Russia denied involvement. VPN demand in Ukraine began noticeably increasing on Feb. 15 in light of cyberattacks, Top10VPN said, and skyrocketed after the invasion, with demand peaking 424% higher than the daily average in the first half of February. On Monday, the websites of several Russian media outlets were hacked, with their regular sites replaced by an anti-war message and calls to stop President Vladimir Putin's invasion.

129,0,"Estonian PM: COVID certificate, 11 p.m. closing time requirement to go from Tuesday (expands)",411 words,Baltic Business Daily,"According to Kallas, she convened a telephone meeting of the government to transform the promise of lifting restrictions into a formal decision of the government. ""Thus, as of Tuesday, we will waive the COVID certificate requirement in Estonia -- everyone will be able to attend cultural and entertainment events, visit food service establishments and go elsewhere without a certificate of vaccination or recovery [from COVID]; we will abolish the 11 p.m. closing time requirement for entertainment establishments and others,"" the premier said. As the coronavirus is still spreading extensively in Estonia, the obligation to wear a mask in public indoor spaces remains in force and it continues to be essential to follow the requirements for dispersion and disinfection. The isolation rules for travel will remain in force, and the restrictions valid in the country of destination must be kept in mind when traveling. With the abolition of the closing time requirement, the risk of young people becoming infected with COVID will increase, along with the risk that larger numbers of older people will become infected as a result, who are at a very high risk of needing hospitalization if they develop severe COVID. Also after the end-of-year holidays, when the closing time requirement was temporarily suspended, there was a sharp increase in infection cases among young people. It is therefore essential to take a rapid antigen test before meeting people of at-risk groups and to wear a protective mask if you are not absolutely sure you are safe. This is absolutely vital when meeting unvaccinated people, the government said. Members of the government will continue discussions on other COVID control measures later this week.

630,0,YouTube and Facebook BAN Russia's RT and Sputnik channels across Europe as big-tech FINALLY clamps down on Moscow propaganda,1379 words,Mail Online,"* State-backed media organisations considered mouthpieces for President Putin * Hackers on Monday targeted Russian sites, bringing down several media outlets * Get the latest breaking news and updates from Russia's invasion of Ukraine  YouTube and Facebook have banned Russian state-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik's channels across Europe. It is the latest in a big-tech clampdown on Moscow's propaganda finally imposed this week following the Russian invasion of Ukraine last Thursday. The Google-owned video platform said the ban was effective immediately, including in the UK, but said it may take some time for the block to become fully effective. The technology giant had previously limited the ability for RT and other Russian channels to make money for advertisements that appear on videos but has extended its sanctions to fully blocking such channels.  Facebook parent company Meta announced yesterday that it had blocked both media organisations, which are considered mouthpieces of Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime. The change means RT and Sputnik's pages are not visible on Youtube, Facebook or Instagram in the EU, but for now, they remain visible in the UK. It comes a day after an international hacking organisation launched a 'cyberwar' on Putin's media, social media sites and Kremlin-backed broadcaster. Anonymous targeted Russian state news agencies TASS, Fontanka, and Kommersant, as well as Kremlin-backed channel RT and the Kremlin website, taking the sites down - though they were back online on Tuesday morning. 'Due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we're blocking YouTube channels connected to RT and Sputnik across Europe, effective immediately,' a statement from Google Europe said. 'It'll take time for our systems to fully ramp up. Our teams continue to monitor the situation around the clock to take swift action.' Former UK deputy prime minister, Sir Nick Clegg, who is now vice president of global affairs at Facebook's parent company, Meta, said the firm had been asked by governments to take further action against Russian state-backed media. 'We have received requests from a number of Governments and the EU to take further steps in relation to Russian state-controlled media,' he said on Twitter on Monday night. 'Given the exceptional nature of the current situation, we will be restricting access to RT and Sputnik across the EU at this time.' He added Meta would continue to work closely with governments on the issue  European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday announced they and their subsidiaries would be banned from broadcasting in the bloc for spreading 'lies to justify Putin's war'. Canadian telecoms operators have also stopped offering the RT channel. Meanwhile yesterday anonymous hackers attacked several Kremlin-backed media outlets, posting a message on one that urged Russia to 'stop this madness'. When trying to access TASS, Fontanka, and Kommersant's websites on Monday morning, error messages appeared and the websites were unable to load. When MailOnline tried to access Fontanka, a news outlet based in St Petersburg, on Monday morning, a message signed by Anonymous urged citizens to 'stop this madness' and said Vladimir Putin has 'put us in danger'. All the sites appeared to be were back online by early Tuesday. Hackers have declared a 'cyber war' on Putin's government after he mounted a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Thursday. Moscow has been accused of producing Hollywood-style 'fake news' videos to inflame tensions with Ukraine. Misinformation about the conflict includes the notion that Ukrainian soldiers are 'radical nationalists' who are defending a genocide against Russians.  Google had earlier blocked access to the Russian media outlets YouTube channels in Ukraine following a request from Kyiv on Saturday. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov wrote on Twitter he requested the ban 'to help Russians and the world to know the truth.' He said: 'I've contacted @YouTube to block the propagandist Russian channels ï¿½?such as Russia 24, TASS, RIA Novosti. 'If they are afraid of speaking the truth, so we should stop this flow of poisonous lies.' Following another request from the Ukrainian government, Google also removed Russia's state-run television network RT, formerly known as Russia Today, from its Google Play Store in Ukraine.  YouTube has removed hundreds of channels and thousands of videos over the past few days that violated its policies by engaging in 'coordinated deception,' CNN[https://www-cnn-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-26-22/h_616d027d24bbde96a0daf999fb7b8369] reported. Russia's communications regulator Roskomnadzor over the weekend demanded that Google restore access to the channels on YouTube in Ukraine and accused Facebook and other big tech companies of 'censorship' for limiting its programs. It said on Sunday that it had written a letter to Alphabet Inc., Google and YouTube's parent company, seeking the removal of all restrictions imposed on state media outlets such as RBC, TV Zvezda and Sputnik.  Roskomnadzor has been cracking down on the country's own outlets, ordering media to remove reports describing the Kremlin's attack as an 'assault, invasion or declaration of war', or face being blocked and fined. Some Russian news websites have been criticised for being part of a media offensive from the Kremlin in which Ukraine's fighters are painted as Nazis and Russia is viewed as a liberating force. Some Russian reporters have also insisted the Russian military is not targeting civilians, despite images of bloodied Ukrainians and bombed-out tower blocks. Describing Ukrainian fighters as 'Nazis', Russian state TV talk show host Olga Skabeyeva said: 'You know, as they retreat, the Ukrainian Nazis continue to destroy Donbas. 'Today Zhelobok was shelled with Grad multiple rocket launchers. Yesterday the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched Tochka ballistic missiles at an oil facility.' Criticised stories included TASS headlines, which claimed Russian troops were 'welcomed with flags in Ukraine's Melitopol' and that Ukrainian forces have 'actively resorted to sabotage'. The propaganda has led many Russians to be convinced that the conflict was provoked by the West. Amid the misinformation, Anonymous announced on Twitter on Thursday evening that it was declaring a 'cyber war' against Vladimir Putin's government. They said shortly before 10pm: 'The Anonymous collective is officially in cyber war against the Russian government.' Around 30 minutes later, they announced that they had taken down the website of the Kremlin-backed TV channel RT, which broadcasts in Britain and has been heavily criticised for its coverage. Anonymous said in their tweet about RT: 'The #Anonymous collective has taken down the website of the #Russian propaganda station RT News.' When MailOnline attempted to access the RT site on Friday morning, it was still inaccessible and only displayed an error message that said 'this site can't be reached'. On Monday, the website appeared to be back up and running. Anonymous have previously targeted groups including the Ku Klux Klan and Islamic extremists. Members are known as 'Anons' and are distinguished by their Guy Fawkes masks. THE ELUSIVE HACKING GROUP ANONYMOUS  Hacker group Anonymous has been linked to online attacks around the world aimed at punishing governments for policies of which the hackers disapprove. Members are known as 'Anons' and are distinguished by their Guy Fawkes masks. The group are seen as anything from digital Robin Hoods to cyber terrorists for their hacking campaigns against government agencies, child pornography sites and the Klu Klux Klan. In 2008 the online community staged a series of protests, pranks, and hacks Church of Scientology as part if its 'Project Chanology.' Later targets of Anonymous 'hacktivism' included government agencies of the US, Israel, Tunisia, Uganda, and others, copyright protection agencies; the Westboro Baptist Church; and corporations such as PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, and Sony. In 2013 they declared war on secretive 'chat sites' used by paedophiles to trade images. Last November they hacked into the Twitter account of the Ku Klux Klan after the white supremacist group distributed flyers threatening 'lethal force' protesters in Ferguson. Dozens of people have been arrested for involvement in Anonymous cyberattacks, in countries including the US, UK, Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, and Turkey."

In the four years since, that viral paper on virality has been cited about 5,000 times by other academic papers and mentioned in more than 500 news outlets. According to Altmetric, which computes an âattention scoreï¿½?[https://www.altmetric.com/details/34105985] for published scientific papers, the MIT study has also earned a mention in 13 Wikipedia articles and one U.S. patent [https://app.dimensions.ai/downloads/patents?ucid=US-11176380-B2]. Then, this week, an excellent feature article [https://www-science-org.proxy.library.nyu.edu/content/article/studying-fighting-misinformation-top-scientific-priority-biologist-argues] on the study of misinformation appeared in Science, by the reporter Kai Kupferschmidt [https://www-science-org.proxy.library.nyu.edu/content/author/kai-kupferschmidt]. Buried halfway through was an intriguing tidbit: The MIT study had failed to account for a bias in its selection of news stories, the article claimed. When different researchers reanalyzed the data last year, controlling for that bias, they found no effectââthe difference between the speed and reach of false news and true news disappeared.ï¿½?So the landmark paper had been ï¿½?completely wrong? [Read: The grim conclusions of the largest-ever study of fake news [https://www-theatlantic-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/technology/archive/2018/03/largest-study-ever-fake-news-mit-twitter/555104/?utm_source=feed]] It was more bewildering than that: When I looked up the reanalysis [https://www-pnas-org.proxy.library.nyu.edu/doi/10.1073/pnas.2100786118] in question, I found that it had mostly been ignored. Written by Jonas Juul, of Cornell University, and Johan Ugander, of Stanford, and published in November 2021, it has accumulated just six citations in the research literature. Altmetrics suggests that it was covered by six news outlets, while not a single Wikipedia article or U.S. patent has referenced its findings. In other words, Vosoughi et al.âs fake news about fake news had traveled much further, deeper, and more quickly than the truth. This was just the sort of thing I love: The science of misinformation is rife with mind-bending anecdotes [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-will-debunk-the-debunkers/] in which a major theory of âpost-truthï¿½?gets struck down by better data [https://slate.com/health-and-science/2018/01/weve-been-told-were-living-in-a-post-truth-age-dont-believe-it.html], then draws a last, ironic breath. In 2016, when a pair of young political scientists wrote a paper that cast doubt on the âbackfire effect [https://papers-ssrn-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2819073],ï¿½?which claims that correcting falsehoods only makes them stronger, at first they couldnât get it published. (The field was reluctant to acknowledge their correction.) The same pattern has repeated several times since: In academic echo chambers, it seems, no one really wants to hear that echo chambers donât exist [https://www.dropbox.com/s/uk005hhio3dysm8/GuessJMP.pdf?dl=0]. And here we were again. âI love this so much,ï¿½?I wrote on Twitter on Thursday morning, above a screenshot of the Science story. I love this so much: Remember the Science paper showing that misinformation travels farther and faster on social media than the truth? It was wrong! But the reanalysis didn't get nearly as much media coverage... pic.twitter.com/n1LHBrAxTn [https://t.co/n1LHBrAxTn]  ï¿½?Daniel Engber (@danengber) March 24, 2022 [https://twitter.com/danengber/status/1506957164723806208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]My tweet began to spread around the world. âMehr Ironie geht nicht,ï¿½?one user wrote [https://twitter.com/murratore/status/1507354872156409862] above it. âLa smentita si sta diffondendo molto piÃ¹ lentamente dello studio fallace,ï¿½?another posted [https://twitter.com/Prolagus/status/1507277211384037376]. I donât speak German or Italian, but I could tell Iâd struck a nerve. Retweets and likes gathered by the hundreds. But then, wait a secondâI was wrong. Within a few hours of my post, Kupferschmidt tweeted that heâd made a mistake [https://twitter.com/kakape/status/1507018418087600132]. Later in the afternoon, he wrote a careful mea culpa [https://twitter.com/kakape/status/1507101467563511808] and Science issued a correction. It seemed that Kupferschmidt had misinterpreted the work from Juul and Ugander: As a matter of fact, the MIT study hadnât been debunked at all. By the time I spoke to Juul on Thursday night, I knew I owed him an apology. Heâd only just logged onto Twitter and seen the pileup of lies about his work. âSomething similar happened when we first published the paper,ï¿½?he told me. Mistakes [https://www.newswise.com/articles/viral-true-tweets-spread-just-as-far-as-viral-untrue-tweets] were madeâeven by fellow scientists [https://twitter.com/GordPennycook/status/1458431976348717061]. Indeed, every time he gives a talk about it, he has to disabuse listeners of the same false inference. âIt happens almost every time that I present the results,ï¿½?he told me. Absolute classic. That study everyone cited with righteous glee, that misinformation spreads faster than true information, was in fact misinformation https://t.co/UqzzktIhJj [https://t.co/UqzzktIhJj]  ï¿½?Medlife Crisis (Rohin) (@MedCrisis) March 24, 2022 [https://twitter.com/MedCrisis/status/1507096191540121610?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]He walked me through the paperâs findingsâwhat it really said. First off, when he reproduced the work from the team at MIT, using the same data set, heâd found the same result: Fake news did reach more people than the truth, on average, and it did so while spreading deeper, faster and more broadly through layers of connections. But Juul figured these four qualitiesâfurther, faster, deeper, broaderâmight not really be distinct: Maybe fake news is simply more âinfectiousï¿½?than the truth, meaning that each person who sees a fake-news story is more likely to share it. As a result, more infectious stories would tend to make their way to more people overall. That greater reachâthe further qualityâseemed fundamental, from Juulâs perspective. The other qualities that the MIT paper had attributed to fake newsâits faster, deeper, broader movement through Twitterâmight simply be an outgrowth of this more basic fact. So Juul and Ugander reanalyzed the data, this time controlling for each news storyâs total reachâand, voilÃ¡, they were right. So fake news does spread further than the truth, according to Juul and Uganderâs study; but the other ways in which it moves across the network look the same. What does that mean in practice? First and foremost, you canât identify a simple fingerprint for lies on social media and teach a computer to identify it. (Some researchers have tried [https://arxiv-org.proxy.library.nyu.edu/pdf/2002.00850.pdf] and failed to build these sorts of automated fact-checkers, based on the work from MIT.) But if Juulâs paper has been misunderstood, he told me, so, too, was the study that it reexamined. The Vosoughi et al. paper arrived in March 2018, at a moment when its dire warnings matched the public mood. Three weeks earlier, the Justice Department had indicted 13 Russians [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/us/politics/russians-indicted-mueller-election-interference.html] and three organizations for waging âinformation warfareï¿½?[https://www-justice-gov.proxy.library.nyu.edu/file/1035477/download] against the U.S. Less than two weeks later, The Guardian and The New York Times published stories about the leak of more than 50 million Facebook usersï¿½?[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html#click=https://t.co/UAg1Q5t1BG] private data to Cambridge Analytica. Fake news was a foreign plot. Fake news elected Donald Trump. Fake news infected all of our social networks. Fake news was now a superbug, and here, from MIT, was scientific proof. As this hyped-up coverage multiplied, Deb Roy, one of the studyâs co-authors, tweeted a warning that the scope of his research had been âover-interpreted [https://twitter.com/dkroy/status/974251282071474177].ï¿½?The findings applied most clearly to a very small subset of fake-news stories on Twitter, he said: Those that had been deemed worthy of a formal fact-check, and which had been adjudicated as false by six specific fact-checking organizations. Yet much of the coverage assumed that the same conclusions could reliably be drawn about all fake news. But Royâs message didnât do that much to stop the spread of that exaggeration. Hereâs a quote from The Guardian [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/audio/2018/mar/16/fake-news-is-twitters-flu-chips-with-everything-podcast] the very next day: âLies spread six times faster than the truth on Twitter.ï¿½?Now, with signs that Russia may be losing its latest information war [https://www-theatlantic-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/technology/archive/2022/03/russia-ukraine-war-propaganda/626975/?utm_source=feed], perhaps psychic needs have changed. Misinformation is still a mortal threat, but U.S. news consumers may be past the peak of fake-news panic. We may even have an appetite for scientific âproofï¿½?that all those fake-news fears were unfounded. When I told Juul that I was sorry for my tweet, he responded with a gracious scoff. âItâs completely human,ï¿½?he said. The science is the science, and the truth can only go so far. In just the time that weâd been talking, my false post about his work had been shared another 28 times."

The wider economic impact on the city could be destructive, but some in the industry are trying to hold their nerve. âIt is still early to comment, as we await news of the restructuring ï¿½?it seems from their announcement that Dream Cruises will continue to operate, and indeed they are currently sailing in Singapore,ï¿½?says Jeff Bent, managing director of Worldwide Cruise Terminals, which operates Hong Kongâs Kai Tak Cruise Terminal. Genting confirms it intends to keep parts of the business operating, including some cruises, but it is still not possible to do so from the companyâs home port, with the Hong Kong government having halted all cruises on January 7 due to rising Covid-19 case numbers. Now Gentingâs 150,000-tonne flagship, the Genting Dream, with its 36 food outlets, two spas, 999-seat theatre and two swimming pools, languishes forlornly at anchor in Hong Kongâs outer harbour. Only five years ago, while dining aboard the Genting Dream with the shipâs Swedish captain, Magnus Gottberg, the topic of conversation was the nascent Asian cruising boom. It had been a tradition that Genting employed Scandinavian deck officers ever since the company bought two old Swedish ferries and launched Star Cruises in 1993. Star Cruises tapped into a lucrative market niche that the big players had missed. Cheap and cheerful offshore casino gambling proved popular with Chinese cruisers. By 2015, when China was forecast to be the biggest market for cruise holidays by 2030, Genting was well poised to profit from the regional luxury cruising boom. Dream Cruises was founded and two new vessels ï¿½?Genting Dream (launched in 2016) and World Dream (launched in 2017 and the ship currently operating in Singapore) ï¿½?were designed to deliver the highest level of guest service and opulence in the region. To capitalise on the growing demand for cruise ships, in 2016 Genting also established MV Werften, comprising three existing German shipyards. The move loaded the business with a colossal overhead and a major financial commitment. Big ships take many years to construct and it is rarely possible to change your mind if there is an unexpected downturn in business. And then Covid-19 struck. Global news was dominated by the drama aboard the Diamond Princess[https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3077058/cabin-fever-life-aboard-quarantined-diamond] cruise ship and footage of passengers being stretchered ashore from other luxury liners to waiting ambulances. International cruising collapsed almost overnight. By September 2020, around six months after the shutdown of cruises worldwide, it was estimated the industry had suffered a loss of US$50 billion. Genting runs a tight corporate ship and went to extraordinary measures to rebuild consumer confidence when cruises resumed. On Genting Dream, all crew members had to be fully vaccinated 14 days before boarding; passengers also needed to be fully vaccinated 14 days before their departure date and pass a Covid-19 PCR test 48 hours before sailing. The shipâs design enables external air to be filtered in, and there is no recirculation of air between cabins. Touchless handwashing stations and a PCR test machine with medical-laboratory-level capabilities were installed along with negative-pressure isolation wards in its medical centre. No cases of Covid-19 have been reported on Genting cruises operating from Hong Kong. It was possible Genting might have weathered the storm. On June 3, 2021, it announced MV Werften had received a loan commitment from Germanyâs Economic Stabilisation Fund to keep the shipyards afloat. And even with limited passenger capacity, two- and three-night themed cruises within Hong Kong waters generated much-needed cash. But then the loan fell through and as Genting scrambled desperately for time, the company was sunk in its home port. Twelve days after cruises were banned, Genting filed for bankruptcy. âThe more relevant issue now is when and under what circumstances the government will allow cruising to resume, given that it continues in most of the rest of the world,ï¿½?Bent says."

Since 2008, 451 Canadian news outlets have closed, 64 of them since the start of the pandemic, he said. ""In 2020, online advertising revenues in Canada were close to $10 billion dollars, with two dominant digital platforms taking over 80 per cent of those revenues. Thatâs an incredible chunk of power in the market,"" Rodriguez said. The minister warned that the internet, though a popular source of news, had allowed more ""mis- and disinformation"" than ever before. The protests in Ottawa and across Canada over the past few weeks have provided compelling examples of fake news online, he said. Rodriguez said a vibrant, professional and non-partisan media where journalists ask difficult questions ï¿½?which could prove uncomfortable for politicians ï¿½?is vital to a thriving democracy. He said a law recently introduced in Australia to level the playing field between tech corporations and media outlets is working and Canada plans to use it as a model, with a few changes. He said the bill, to be introduced soon, will keep the government at ""arms length"" and the process transparent. Canada would have a regulator and impose arbitration if a fair deal cannot be struck between Canadian media and the likes of Google and Meta, formerly known as Facebook. Rodriguez said the digital giants did not want a law, though Google's vice-president of news Richard Gingras said the search engine is not opposed to regulation. Gingras told the conference Google is willing to ""step up and do our part."" But he said it was important to ""protect the open internet"" and the principle of free linking between sites. He said Google sent traffic to news sites worth around half a billion dollars a year. He criticized Australia's law, saying its arbitration model was unbalanced and unpredictable and he hoped Canada would come up with a more workable blueprint. Gingras, who has been in talks with the government about their plans, raised the prospect of a fund digital giants could pay into to support Canada's media, based on a formula. John Boynton, vice-chair of NordStar Capital which owns the Toronto Star and dozens of other daily and weekly papers, said the Australian law had led to a huge injection of cash into the media. Not only has Australia's media stopped laying off journalists but now has funds to start hiring them again, he said. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 23, 2022. ââï¿½? Facebook funds a fellowship that supports journalism positions at The Canadian Press.  Torstar holds an investment in The Canadian Press as part of a joint agreement with subsidiaries of the Globe and Mail and Montreal's La Presse."

Of the 61 items assessed by the airlines, the most complained about by consumers are: the difficulty of reimbursement, flight cancellation and communication difficulty. To reverse the negative scenario, the National Consumer Secretariat issued an orientation to Procons all over the country. The document calls for the verification of reports of noncompliance with clauses by companies. Between 2020 and 2021, 101,661 complaints were registered on Consumidor.gov.br against the three airlines operating in Brazil. Of these, 38,667 were related to refund difficulties, 20,430 were related to flight cancellations and another 11,708 complaints related to the inefficiency of the Customer Service (SAC). The survey considers the period between 2020 and 2021. This is the first time that the federal government releases specific data on the performance of the airline industry during the most critical period of the pandemic. Attendance Senacon also recommended that airlines invest in Customer Service. The aim is to ensure that the companies solve the complaints before they become legalized. Another point is to simplify the language of the texts presented to consumers on communication platforms. The document also directs companies to make information about regulatory changes and emergency measures available in easily accessible places, including on the internet, as well as facilitating consumers to change tickets autonomously, using digital tools."

940,0,Genting blames German state after shipbuilder's collapse,352 words,Agence France Presse,"The company took Mecklenburg-West Pomerania to court in December for the payment of $88 million (78 million euros). The money Genting HK claimed dates back to an agreement with the government in June to provide a bridging loan for the struggling dockyard operation on the Baltic coast. A ruling in the case is expected shortly. According to Genting, the state linked the payment to conditions that were not in the original contract, including increasing Genting's own contribution to the rescue package from 30 million to 60 million euros. Lawyers representing Mecklenburg-West Pomerania rejected the suggestion the state had a political motivation, saying it was required under its budget law to closely examine the loans it made. The state also said that the June agreement extended a credit line of up to 148 million euros, while the shipbuilder's funding gap had risen to 600 million euros. The shipbuilder MV Werften, which employs around 2,000 people across three dockyards, filed for bankruptcy on Monday after failing to secure funding for the completion of the ""Global One"" cruise ship. Until recently the company was engaged in negotiations with stated and federal government to try and reach an agreement on a financial support package to finish the mega-liner, 80 percent built up to now. Economy and Climate Minister Robert Habeck said on Monday that the government had ""pulled out all the stops"" to avoid MV Werften filing for bankruptcy.

And 2FA (those one-time codes you use together with a password) make things harder for the crooks, because your password alone is no longer enough to give them access to your account. #Talk to a friend you know face-to-face whoâs done it before: If you are active on social media or in the blogosphere, you might as well prepare in case you ever get a copyright infringement notice for real. (Weâre assuming the accuation will be false, but the complaint itself will actually exist.) If you know someone who who has already gone through the genuine process once, see if theyâll tell you how it went in real life. This will make it much easier to spot fake complaints in future.  Phishing is a trick used by scammers to trick potential victims in revealing sensitive information through fraudulent messages, and dubious login pages.

69,1,Steinway Plans IPO on NYSE -- WSJ,580 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"Steinway Musical Instruments Holdings Inc., makers of the iconic Steinway piano, is tuning up for another performance on the New York Stock Exchange. The 169-year-old company, whose pianos are played in homes and on stages by the likes of Billy Joel, plans to go public, according to regulatory documents filed Thursday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The New York-based company hasn't been listed on a stock exchange since 2013, when it was bought for about $512 million and taken private by Paulson & Co., the hedge fund founded by billionaire John Paulson. At the time, Paulson & Co. outbid another buyout offer from private-equity firm Kohlberg & Co. This time it plans to use the stock symbol STWY, a departure from last time around when it used LVB as a tribute to Ludwig van Beethoven. A spokeswoman for Steinway declined to give a date for the initial public offering or say how much money it plans to raise. Proceeds of the IPO will go to Mr. Paulson, his firm and other stakeholders, according to the filing. A spokesman for Paulson & Co. didn't comment. A Steinway grand piano costs between $60,000 and $340,000, according to the filing. A smaller, upright piano starts at $40,000. The company also sells brass and woodwind instruments through its Conn-Selmer line. The Spirio, a self-playing piano, is its priciest model, making up about 32% of its total piano sales last year, the filing said. The Spirio appeals to those who don't know how to play but still want to hear one playing in their house, according to the company.  Steinway reported revenue of $538 million in 2021, up 29% from the year before, according to the filing. Net income rose 14% to $59 million in the same period. The company's filing said it wants to sell more pianos in China, where it says sales of luxury goods are growing and more children are learning to play the piano than in other parts of the world. It opened a Beijing store in 2017. ""China represents a unique market for Steinway due to two primary cultural and structural factors,"" the filing said. ""A deep-rooted reverence for classical music, specifically piano music, and a sizeable and rapidly expanding middle and upper class with an appetite for luxury Western products."" Steinway was founded in 1853 by Henry Engelhard Steinway, a German immigrant who developed the first Steinway piano in a Manhattan loft. A factory was opened in Astoria, a neighborhood in New York City's Queens borough, in 1873. A second one was opened in Hamburg, Germany, seven years later. Pianos are still made in both cities, said the company, which has its headquarters in Astoria. Steinway Street, a busy Astoria street, is named after it. Corrections & Amplifications Steinway is a 169-year-old company. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said it is 165 years old. (Corrected on April 15.)

175,0,Pepsi and Coke Take a Step Back -- WSJ,1472 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"PepsiCo Inc ., too, said it was halting sales of its big soda brands there, such as Pepsi-Cola and 7UP, but would continue to sell potato chips and daily essentials such as milk, cheese and baby formula. The snacks-and-drinks giant is exploring options for its business in Russia, including writing off the value of the unit, according to people familiar with the matter. Large Western companies are under increasing pressure to pull out of the country in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Many companies -- such as American Express Co ., Shell PLC and Boeing Co . -- already have announced plans to suspend or scale back their operations. Those moves came after Western governments imposed sanctions on the country in retaliation for the invasion, and financial firms took steps that could close off Russia from global markets.  McDonald's said it was temporarily closing its roughly 850 restaurants in the country and would continue paying the 62,000 people it employs in Russia. The company said it couldn't yet determine when it might reopen the restaurants in Russia and would consider whether any additional steps might be required Coke's business in Russia and Ukraine contributed about 1% to 2% of its operating revenues and income in 2021. The company had an ownership interest of about 21% in Coca-Cola HBC AG , Coke's bottling and distribution partner in the region, as of Dec. 31.  Coca-Cola HBC and PepsiCo both import soft-drink concentrates to Russia from Ireland and bottle drinks in local plants. Coca-Cola HBC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  Unilever PLC also said Tuesday it was suspending imports and exports of its products into and out of Russia. Unilever , which doesn't break out sales in the region, said it would continue to supply the essential food and hygiene products it makes in Russia.  PepsiCo is reluctant to shut down its Russian unit, which includes a large dairy business it bought for about $5 billion a decade ago. In an email to staff Tuesday, PepsiCo Chief Executive Ramon Laguarta wrote that the company has a responsibility to continue to operate there because tens of thousands of Russians depend on the company for their livelihoods and for daily essentials like milk and baby food. Revenue from PepsiCo 's Russian unit was $3.4 billion in 2021 -- a decline of 30% from its peak of $4.9 billion in 2013 -- making it the third-largest market for the company after the U.S. and Mexico. The impact of writing off the Russian unit would be minimal because it contributes little to PepsiCo 's earnings, some of the people familiar with the matter said. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli , who oversees one of the largest public pension funds in the U.S., wrote last week to PepsiCo , McDonald's and other companies, asking them to consider pausing or ending their operations in Russia.  PepsiCo has 20,000 employees in Russia. The company's 24 plants and three R&D centers there make soft drinks, potato chips, milk, yogurt, cheese, baby food and baby formula. The bulk of its Russian business is Wimm-Bill-Dann , a dairy-and-juice company PepsiCo bought in 2011 for about $5 billion. Officials at PepsiCo 's highest levels have discussed the geopolitical crisis in the region nearly every day since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, some of the people familiar with the matter said. For weeks they have evaluated different scenarios of how the business may be affected by supply-chain and other financial challenges stemming from the conflict and what steps PepsiCo may need to take, one of the people said.  PepsiCo could write down the value of its Russian business to zero, modeling the process it used for its Venezuelan operations in 2015, some of the people said. The Venezuelan unit is still operating -- and PepsiCo still owns it -- but it doesn't contribute to the soda-and-snack giant's earnings. If PepsiCo 's Russian unit manages to generate a profit as the nation's economy goes into a tailspin, PepsiCo is unlikely to be able to transfer those profits out of the country given the restrictions on transferring Russian rubles because of sanctions, one of the people said.  PepsiCo 's business there operates in rubles, uses locally sourced milk and potatoes and imports soft-drink concentrates. Its revenue has declined significantly since Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea, and it now faces supply-chain challenges as Western countries impose sanctions against Russia, some of the people said. The company could take this opportunity to write off a business that hasn't generated as much revenue as the company had hoped, some of the people said. At the same time, PepsiCo takes a long view on emerging markets, and doesn't want to lose the goodwill of shoppers there, current and former executives said. Pepsi was among the first American brands to take hold in the Soviet Union. In 1959, the company organized a booth at the American National Exhibition in Moscow. With the help of Vice President Richard Nixon, PepsiCo executive Don Kendall offered a glass to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, who agreed to several refills and declared it ""refreshing.""  PepsiCo opened its first plant in the Soviet Union in 1974 after agreeing to a barter arrangement in which the beverage giant took its profits in Stolichnaya vodka. The deal made Pepsi-Cola the first Western-branded consumer product bottled in the Soviet Union and gave it a leg up on rival Coca-Cola Co ., which wouldn't enter the market for more than a decade.  PepsiCo furthered its push into the region in 1988 when it became one of the first Western advertisers to buy commercials on Soviet television, including a pair of TV spots featuring Michael Jackson. Mr. Kendall -- who was PepsiCo 's chief executive from 1963 to 1986 and later served as an ambassador for the company -- believed that business could help build bridges between nations at a time of elevated tensions between the Soviet Union and the West. ""Trying to find a way through business to build relationships was something Don was very passionate about,"" said Michael White , a former executive who led PepsiCo 's overseas business from 2003 to 2009 and once met Russian President Vladimir Putin with Mr. Kendall. ""Unfortunately, it isn't what we all would hope.""  Coca-Cola 's entry in 1992, after the fall of the Soviet Union, brought the cola wars to Russia. PepsiCo opened its first snacks plant there in 2002. Then the rivalry moved to juices. Coke bought fruit-juice maker Multon Co. for about $500 million in 2005, and PepsiCo followed with the $2 billion acquisition of fruit-and-vegetable-juice business OAO Lebedyansky in 2009. Coke countered by buying Nidan Soki, another large juice maker. Then in 2011, PepsiCo bought OAO Wimm-Bill-Dann. The deal was PepsiCo 's second-largest acquisition ever after its 2001 purchase of Quaker Oats Co ., and established PepsiCo as the biggest food-and-beverage business in Russia and a leader in the country's fast-growing dairy market. PepsiCo said it made the acquisition because it was looking for growth in emerging markets and wanted to expand into healthier foods and drinks. The company expected Russia to supply about $5 billion in annual revenue. After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the ruble tumbled and Russia fell into a recession that hurt the Russian businesses of both PepsiCo and Coke's bottler there, Coca-Cola HBC . The business unit now faces operational challenges as Russia's economy becomes increasingly cut off from the rest of the world. Russians tend to buy Western brands like Coke, Pepsi or Lay's potato chips when they have disposable income, but turn to cheaper local brands when money is tight, industry executives said. To manage inflation, PepsiCo 's Russian business may have to increase prices or decrease package sizes. And it may face supply-chain disruptions as sanctions disrupt shipments from other countries.

Among big banks that are reporting later in the day, Morgan Stanley edged lower, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc , Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co gained between 0.3% and 0.8% in premarket trading. Quarterly results from big U.S. banks are expected to show a sharp decline in investment banking revenue and first-quarter earnings overall due to companies pausing deals amid choppy equity markets.  JPMorgan Chase & Co's CEO Jamie Dimon warned of economic uncertainties arising from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and soaring inflation on Wednesday, after first-quarter profits at the largest U.S. bank slumped 42%. Nevertheless, Wall Street's main indexes rallied sharply in the previous session after a rough start to the week boosted by a recovery in tech and tech-adjacent stocks as treasury yields receded from near three-year highs.  Twitter Inc jumped 12% after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he has offered to buy 100% of the social media company for $54.2 per share in cash.  UnitedHealth Group Inc rose 1.1% after reporting a 3.5% rise in quarterly profit, helped in part by strength at its Optum healthcare services unit.

Since the pandemic began, there have been a total of over five months of forced closures in previous waves, and the longest stretch we have been allowed to do business in the last two years is about 10 months. How is a small business expected to survive? Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge[https://www.scmp.com/knowledge], our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Online classes are out of the question. We mainly teach pole dancing and aerial arts, and the number of students that have the proper set-up to do this at home is negligible. We have had no choice to put all our staff on non-paid leave. We have no idea if they will return as some have had to find other jobs or have left the city. Rent alone accounts for half of our normal expenditure. That is the cost of doing business in Hong Kong, and one we have managed to make work during normal times. How we are supposed to make it work under the current restrictions[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3162190/coronavirus-hong-kongs-fifth-wave-has-already] is anyoneâs guess. I would really love to hear from any other business owners who, over a 30-month period, have had to pay 50 per cent of their regular expenses for at least eight months without any income and who are managing to keep their business afloat.

If it passes, we can try to continue to operate knowing full well that 2022 will be a financial loss as we try to pay back the owed rent from months of forced closure. If it does not pass, we can give up all hope and let the landlord evict us now. Either way, just do it quickly. However, if it does not pass, I think the message is loud and clear. If you are not in real estate, you are not important to the Hong Kong government. Well, good luck trying to rent out property in this city when everybody else has left. Jack Yu, Mong Kok According to the estimates[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3169739/hong-kong-university-data-model-predicts-peak] of University of Hong Kong researchers, there will soon be about 1.8 million âCovid-19 survivorsï¿½?in Hong Kong (including myself). Multiple research studies elsewhere have shown that we are protected against the virus for at least four to six months after infection. It seems to me that the vaccine pass scheme[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3167882/coronavirus-what-hong-kongs-vaccine-pass-scheme] could usefully have a second category added for such âCovid-19 safeï¿½?people. Bars and restaurants could then be permitted to operate in âpost Covid-19ï¿½?mode, only admitting âCovid-19 safeï¿½?people as verified by the Leave Home Safe app. There would be no reason for any limits on table sizes or opening hours for such restaurants and bars, and this could be the lifeline the food and beverage industry so desperately needs to tide them over until the central government has caught up with the rest of the world. I fear that this idea would be too radical for our administrators, but I live in hope that they will see the light.

The Star Ferry is a historic emblem of Hong Kongâs waterfront and holds significant value for many who have lived here. Donât let Star Ferry fail. Our government is partly responsible for the economic collapse of many companies due to its stringent Covid-19 policies. They need to start bailing out Hong Kong. If other economies can print money and survive, Hong Kong too can print money, issue debt and survive. Rishi Teckchandani, Mid-Levels Some private clubs have shut down temporarily in the battle against Covid-19 but continue to take their monthly dues in full. Why are we being charged the full monthly membership fees when none of the facilities is open? At best, we should not be charged and at worst, the fees should be reduced. Many of us run businesses and we still have to provide goods or services to our clients so that we can generate income and support our families and staff. We donât have the luxury of sending an email to our clients to tell them that we are closed and cannot serve them but will continue to debit their bank accounts as usual. Deepak Mirchandani, Jardine's Lookout Creativity is lacking in the government. In response to the pandemicâs widespread devastation in 2020, Hong Kong leaders had a real flash of inspiration; their plan to cover up to 50 per cent[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3168734/hong-kong-industry-chiefs-call-new-round-wage] of workersï¿½?salaries, capped at HK$9,000 (US$1,150) a month for each company, was brilliant. It was the kind of creativity that we needed then and which we need now. This successful idea was locally grown, but now we appear bereft of the opportunity to think for ourselves. Hong Kong people got behind the governmentâs effort to support the business community and its employees, and after six months we were able to breathe again as the pandemic receded. But the lesson has been forgotten. Instead of supporting businesses and workers, the government is giving us a handout[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3169510/some-hongkongers-will-receive-first-half-new-batch] which will be modestly helpful for perhaps a month or so but there will be no follow-through.

604,1,Entity rejects PEC on pricing policy for oil derivatives,915 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"To promote the desired policy, the bill creates the Petroleum Product Price Stabilization Fund (FEPD), with the crude oil export tax as its source of revenue. According to the PL, the sales prices for distributors and traders of oil derivatives produced in the country and imported cannot exceed the international market values, having as a reference the dollar prices practiced in the US Gulf Coast. ""The PL does not prioritize a protection of the oil sector, does not preserve Brazilian sovereignty and does not guarantee national self-sufficiency in oil production or the supply of its derivatives, besides prioritizing the international market instead of the national market,"" criticized the rapporteur. Carmela GrÃ¼ne commented on the scope of the importance of the energy source for the country's development and for providing quality of life for the population. ""Oil is still our main energy matrix, being responsible for much of the economic development, for being able, along with its derivative products, to move the domestic economy and develop formal employment, direct and indirect, contributing to the eradication of poverty, social inequality, and hunger."" In her analysis, the lawyer mentioned the constitutional mission conferred to Petrobras. ""The Constitution of the Republic requires Petrobras, as a member of the indirect public administration, to act within the principles of legality, publicity, morality, efficiency and impersonality, with strategic assignments for national security, given the activity is essential to the economic development of the country, i.e., of interest to the whole community,"" he said. The rapporteur also pointed out that the autarchy ""must submit to competition, being forbidden to increase profits arbitrarily, to repress the abuse of economic power. Compliance with the prohibition of arbitrary increase in profits, according to Carmela GrÃ¼ne, is not effectively required. ""In 2021, Petrobras achieved the highest profit in its history, reaching the R$106.6 billion mark, and shareholders received R$37.3 billion in dividends, while in the same year the consumer paid record prices for fuel, in addition to bearing the effects of these increases throughout the entire production chain that depends on the energy matrix,"" she criticized. Carmela GrÃ¼ne also addressed the international geopolitical context. ""With the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the increase in oil prices skyrocketed to over US$ 100 a barrel, showing how exposed Brazil is, as it could guarantee more affordable prices if it conducted a national energy security policy focused on the public interest,"" she suggested. The lawyer also criticized the forecast contained in PL 750/2021, according to which the FEPD will be regulated by means of a presidential decree: ""A totally undemocratic way, when it should take place through a broad public debate."" In her disapproval of the PL, Carmela GrÃ¼ne also said that ""what has been happening in Brazilian politics is a supposed stimulus to free competition, when, in fact, there is a prevalence of economic interests contrary to public interests, because there is no genuine concern with the country's energy development and the supply of low-cost products to the population. The general coordinator of the Single Petroleum Workers Federation (FUP), Deyvid Bacelar, says that the Federation and the affiliated Sindipetros will intensify the movement with the oil category against the delivery of Petrobras to the private sector, either through the sale of company assets or the privatization of the entire company, exactly as it is about to happen with the Post Office and Eletrobras. ""If this 'misgovernment' of President Jair Bolsonaro and his team has the audacity to present any Bill to sell Petrobras, this same 'misgovernment' will have to face the biggest strike of the oil category"", he guarantees. The movement, he says, will be very similar to the two largest strikes of the workers, in 1995 and 2020. ""Brazil will stop. Petrobras will stop for Brazil and for the Brazilians. Bacelar reiterates that these companies are strategic assets for the country. ""To say that the sale of these assets will solve Brazil's economy only shows ignorance of the reality of public management. By privatizing Petrobras, the Federal Government will no longer have the opportunity to act as a controlling shareholder capable of changing the current fuel price policy, which bleeds the Brazilian population. And this legacy will be 'inherited' to a new government, which, in case it wants to face the PPI issue, will not be able to do anything"", says the leader. The import parity price (PPI), a policy implemented in 2016 in the government of former president Michel Temer, determines that the domestic fuel market price must be aligned with international market values. This external influence makes oil derivatives more expensive in Brazil and leverages inflation in the country, according to the latest data from the National Wide Consumer Price Index (IPCA), presented by the IBGE last week."

872,1,HAYS SEES WORKERS COMMAND PAY RISES OF UP TO 25% IN BOOMING JOBS MARKET,561 words,Press Association National Newswire,"He said there is a shortage of skills worldwide as firms embark on a hiring spree across economies emerging from the pandemic. Technology specialists are among the most in demand due to a push for digital transformations across corporates worldwide, according to Hays. Mr Venables said it was ""absolutely the strongest"" market he has seen during his time at the group and likely for decades. ""It's the highest permanent recruitment market in my 16 years with Hays and the highest wage inflation I've seen,"" he said.  Hays hailed a record performance at the start of 2022 due to the hot jobs market, but revealed a hit of around Â£5 million after pulling out of Russia. The group posted a 32% surge in like-for-like fees over its third quarter to the end of March, with record-breaking results across 19 countries and its highest ever monthly fees in March. Fees in the UK and Ireland rose 29%, it added. Hays said the closure early last month of its offices in Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine will result in about Â£5 million in one-off costs. The sites in Moscow and St Petersburg - which employed 245 staff - accounted in half-year results for around Â£5.9 million in group fees and about 1% or Â£800,000 of company earnings. Full-year guidance remains for full-year operating profits of Â£210 million to Â£215 million, excluding the Russia hit.  Alistair Cox, chief executive of Hays, said: ""While we are mindful of increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, client and candidate confidence remains strong, with continued skill shortages and rising wage inflation globally."" The group said it had boosted its consultancy workforce by 4% since the end of last year - up 27% year-on-year - and expects to add up to another 3% in its final quarter as it beefs up operations to match a buoyant jobs market. Official figures earlier this week confirmed the jobs market in the UK remains solid, with the rate of unemployment falling further below pre-pandemic levels, to 3.8% - the lowest since December 2019. But there were signs of easing demand for staff, with the smallest monthly increase in UK payrolled workers since February last year, with vacancy growth also slowing. Mr Venables said in the white collar sector, he was ""not seeing any signs of things cooling off"" yet. Hays said the UK and Ireland region - which accounts for 22% of group net fees - saw third-quarter performance led by permanent jobs recruitment up 59% while temporary hiring fees rose 13%. The North West and the South East had stand-out fee growth of 49% and 41% respectively, while Ireland enjoyed a 61% surge. London - its largest region - increased by 28%, including London City up 57%."

That's better than the 10.5% increase that Wall Street was expecting. In the U.S., same-store sales rose 7.5% as limited-time products like the McRib and new options like a revamped chicken sandwich drew customers despite higher menu prices. McDonald's said U.S. prices climbed just over 6% in 2021. A rapidly growing U.S. loyalty program also help draw in customers. My McDonald's Rewards, which launched nationwide in July, now has 21 million active members, the company said. Revenue rose 13% to $6.01 billion, which was just shy of Wall Street expectations, with sales crimped by coronavirus restrictions in Australia and China. McDonald's was stung by rising prices and higher labor costs. U.S. costs for food and paper products rose 4% in 2021, and 3% internationally in 2021, Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said. Those costs are expected to double globally in 2022, with inflation more pronounced in the first half of the year, he said. âWe certainly donât expect it to wipe away what we gained either in 2021 or prior to that,"" Ozan said Thursday in a conference call with investors.

Franchisees own 93% of McDonald's 40,000 restaurants worldwide, but several thousand stores are owned by McDonald's. The company said in May it would raise average hourly wages by 10% to $13 per hour, rising to $15 per hour by 2024. Entry-level workers now make at least $11 per hour. McDonald's President and CEO Chris Kempczinski said competitive pay has helped McDonald's keep its restaurants open. At the U.S. peak of the omicron variant wave in mid-December, around 10% of restaurants were operating with limited hours. That has dropped to 1%, Kempczinski said. McDonaldâs also paid out higher incentive compensation after the company topped internal 2021 forecasts. Shares of McDonald's, which hit an all-time high earlier this month after a 20% gain over the past year, were essentially flat Thursday."

He started his career in Chicago before moving his practice to Milwaukee. While working at Ross & Hardies, Harlan went to leadership to discuss the lack of diversity and got involved in the firm's recruiting efforts. Thanks to Harlanâs efforts, the firm reached out to encourage more minorities to apply to their firm. In 2016, Harlan co-founded MWH Law Group in Milwaukee with his partner Kerrie Murphy. Heâs continuously looking for opportunities to diversify the legal profession. Murphy, who has worked with Harlan for over 20 years, said sheâs honored to be his partner, noting that he is extremely humble and prefers to work in the background. âThroughout his career, Emery has taken the same focus and energy he uses on behalf of his clients and used it to promote greater diversity and inclusion in the legal profession,ï¿½?said Murphy.

496,0,New York's Beleaguered Hotel Industry Braces for Even More Hotels -- WSJ,855 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"Hotel operators and developers were drawn to the city's strong economy and growing tourism sector in the years before Covid-19. In the decade leading up to the pandemic, New York City added more than 41,000 hotel rooms, increasing the city's room count by 47%. Business travel and tourism cratered during the pandemic and many hotels are still struggling to sell rooms. But even lackluster demand hasn't derailed hotel construction. There were 130 hotels in the New York pipeline as of the third quarter, which would add more than 22,000 rooms in the coming years, Lodging Econometrics said. Hotels scheduled to open this spring include a Ritz-Carlton location in Manhattan's NoMad neighborhood north of Madison Square Park, and Aman New York, a luxury hotel and residences in the historic Crown Building on Fifth Avenue. Some hoteliers say they are looking beyond the pandemic, confident that demand from tourists and business travelers will eventually recover. ""We're not deterred,"" said Brett Blass, chief operating officer for Triumph Hotels, which operates six Manhattan hotels and is open to adding more. ""We believe in New York."" Yet hotel analysts caution that building more rooms could exacerbate the industry's woes by boosting supply at a time of depressed demand. International and business travel are two key pillars of hotel demand in New York, and the disruptions caused by the Omicron variant have further delayed the return of these customers. New York hotel occupancy rates averaged about 59% last year compared with 86% in 2019, according to preliminary estimates from hotel-analytics firm STR. Annual revenue per available room, a key metric for hotels' bottom lines, reached only 57% of 2019 levels. ""Certainly the last thing New York really needs are new hotel rooms opening up during a crisis,"" said Patrick Scholes, a lodging analyst with Truist Securities Inc. Atit Jariwala, chief executive of Bridgeton Holdings, said robust leisure travel had been powering his two Manhattan hotels toward a strong holiday season until Omicron emerged. Flight cancellations, customer fears over rising Covid-19 cases and infections among hotel staff roiled business in the final weeks of 2021. His Walker Hotel Greenwich Village ended December with occupancy at 85%, he said, a strong showing compared with the citywide average, but still 10 percentage points behind what Mr. Jariwala had been expecting as of late November. Cancellations have continued into January, already a slow time for New York City hotels, he added. Even so, Bridgeton is among the many owners expanding in New York. The company recently won a bid for a Brooklyn hotel that was in foreclosure. Dozens of New York City hotels closed permanently during the pandemic, and many others closed for extended periods. But a fair number of properties have reopened in recent months, and there are now just 6.7% fewer hotel rooms in operation than there were in January 2020, according to STR data. ""It's been a slower recovery for New York,"" said Carter Wilson, senior-vice president at STR. ""But it's on the right path."" One factor that could slow the pace of new hotel openings is industry regulation. Late last year, then-Mayor Bill de Blasio and the City Council implemented several new restrictions on hotels, including a requirement that hotel owners pay severance to laid-off employees if their properties remained closed past Nov. 1. Another law requires operators to receive special approval from the City Planning Commission before building or expanding hotels. ""I do think it will put a dent in the pipeline,"" Mr. Jariwala said. Concerns over the glut in hotel rooms began before the pandemic, as competition from new developments and short-term rental websites like Airbnb Inc . put downward pressure on room rates and prompted several owners to default on their mortgages. Jason Halpern of JMH Development became so worried about the number of new hotels opening in Manhattan that he scrapped plans in late 2019 to build two-limited service hotels in Queens near LaGuardia Airport. ""We were shovel ready to build the hotels,"" Mr. Halpern said. His group had spent more than $4 million on costs related to the hotels, he added, before deciding to change course. But Mr. Halpern has no regrets. The developer ultimately built a 143-unit residential building, The Astor LIC, which is now fully leased.

456,0,"5 shot, 1 fatally, at hotel in D.C.",768 words,The Washington Post,"""The pieces are starting to come together,"" Contee told reporters of the investigation, saying some people who had been in the hotel room know one another and were cooperating. He said the 3:30 a.m. shooting was confined to a single room and posed no threat to the public, adding, ""We are hopeful to bring this case to a closure very soon."" Police said a woman found gravely injured in the room died at a hospital. She was not immediately identified. Another woman was found wounded in the lobby, and a third woman was found elsewhere in the hotel. Two men who were shot went on their own to a hospital. Contee described the gathering in the hotel room as a party or social event and said the people who rented the room are from Maryland. Police said they were still working to determine what led to the shooting. Jamie L. Howser, the regional director of operations for Coakley Williams Hotel Management Co., which runs the Days Inn in the 4400 block of Connecticut Avenue NW, issued a brief statement offering prayers to the people involved and referring all questions to police. Reached by phone, Howser declined to address concerns raised by the community and by Contee about nuisance issues around the hotel, next to a dry cleaner that the police chief said he frequents. Contee said there had been 73 calls for police to the hotel's address since July, including 18 reporting disorderly conduct and others mentioning issues including drugs and loitering. The chief said he sees people gathered in front of the hotel, which he attributed to the bulk of complaints. There is no evidence that these concerns contributed to Thursday's shooting, but for residents who have raised concerns for more than a year, it was a realization of their worst fears. ""I sound a little frustrated,"" said David Cristeal, chairman of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission for the area. ""We've had the walk. We've had the talk. We've had the community meetings. Now it's a tragedy - somebody has died."" Cristeal said his group and others have repeatedly looked to officials for solutions, to no avail. Concerned residents held a community walk with police and city officials on the block two weeks ago, but Cristeal said that ""we never really got much information."" On Thursday evening, residents gathered outside the Days Inn, joined by Contee and D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser. They started by discussing the fatal shooting in the hotel above them - beginning with a moment of silence for the life lost - and then quickly launched into a more sweeping conversation about an uncharacteristic uptick in violent crime in their neighborhood. ""I think this size of this crowd reflects the fact that the community is extraordinarily concerned with the rise in crime,"" said D.C. Council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3), addressing a group of 30 or so people gathered around her. The crowd clapped and nodded in agreement when Cheh referred to a ""state of lawlessness in the community."" Several people asked city officials what more they could do to curtail drug use and carjackings in their neighborhood, among other crimes, and sought more information on their request to declare the Days Inn a nuisance. A representative from the D.C. attorney general's office, which handles nuisance complaints, said at the meeting that he could not comment on individual cases but that the office was looking into multiple properties. There have been over 278 calls to police over the past two years related to the Days Inn, according to 2nd District Cmdr. Duncan Bedlion, who joined the group Thursday evening. The most common calls were reports of disorderly behavior, he said. peter.hermann@washpost.com emily.davies@washpost.com michael.brice-saddler@washpost.com Susan Svrluga, Kathy Orton and Magda Jean-Louis contributed to this report."

Reports Q2 2022 Results,2684 words,Canada NewsWire,"* Generated gross profit of $228,759 during Q2 2022, a 349% increase from prior quarter * Recently announced proposed acquisition of Novamind expected to grow annual revenues more than five times from current levels; positions Numinus as a leading, integrated mental healthcare company providing psychedelic-assisted therapies * Ended quarter with strong cash position of $48.3 million All financial results are reported in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. VANCOUVER, BC, April 14, 2022 /CNW/ - Numinus Wellness Inc.[https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3506118-1&h=342616423&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnuminus.ca%2F&a=Numinus+Wellness+Inc.] (""Numinus"" or the ""Company"") (TSX: NUMI) (OTCQX: NUMIF), a mental health care company advancing innovative treatments and safe, evidence-based psychedelic-assisted therapies, today announced its fiscal quarter results for the three and six months ended February 28, 2022 (""Q2 2022""). ""Numinus' fiscal second quarter demonstrated the strength of our growing service offering and the efficiency of our operating platform, with gross margin improving to 29.1% during Q2 2022 ï¿½?compared to 6.5% in the previous quarter. Most of this improvement is due to the successful integration of the Neurology Centre of Toronto ï¿½?an acquisition we completed during just the quarter before, and the expansion of Ketamine-assisted therapy services across our clinic network,"" said Payton Nyquvest, Founder and CEO. ""We're pleased to see the momentum in our business continue to grow, despite the seasonal slowdown associated with the December holidays during the second quarter."" Mr. Nyquvest continued: ""Looking forward, our recently announced proposed acquisition of Novamind will be transformational for Numinus as we establish a strong U.S. presence with eight revenue producing clinics located in Utah and Arizona. It also provides two additional clinical research sites and a strong pipeline of clinical research business, which will significantly expand Numinus' contract research capabilities. We are very excited about the opportunities ahead as we firmly establish the Numinus brand and our comprehensive combined mental health and wellness offering in the U.S. Collectively, our combined business will become a leading integrated mental healthcare company providing psychedelic-assisted therapies across North America, generating more revenue than any of our peers."" Second Quarter Financial Highlights * Revenues grew 240% year-over-year to $0.8 million in Q2 2022, due primarily to the acquisitions of Mindspace and the Neurology Centre of Toronto. Sequentially, revenues were in line with the prior quarter, representing periods of increased client appointments alongside the seasonally slower period over December holidays. * Gross margin grew significantly to 29.1% during Q2 2022, compared to 6.5% in Q1 2022 and -25.7% in Q2 2021. The marked improvement in gross margin is due mostly to a greater proportion of higher margin services being booked across Numinus' wellness clinics. Gross margin improvement was most notable in the two wellness clinic businesses acquired in the last 12 months: Mindspace and the Neurology Centre of Toronto. * Gross profit of $228,759 in Q2 2022, a 349% increase compared to gross profit compared to Q1 2022, and a significant improvement compared to the gross loss of $59,724 in Q2 2021. * Loss was $7.8 million for Q2 2022, compared to a loss of $4.2 million in Q2 2021. * Cash balance of $48.3 million as of February 28, 2022. First Six Months Financial Highlights * Revenues during the first half of fiscal 2022 grew 242% year-over-year to $1.6 million due primarily to the acquisitions of Mindspace and the Neurology Centre of Toronto. * Gross margin during the first half of 2022 was 17.8%, compared to -21.2% in the same period last year. * Gross profit during the first half of 2022 was $279,724, a significant improvement compared to the gross loss of $97,859 in the first half of 2021. * Loss was $13.2 million for the first half of 2022, compared to a loss of $6.2 million in the first half of 2021. Operational Highlights During and Subsequent to Q2 2022: Numinus Health ï¿½?Numinus Wellness Clinic Network * Q2 2022 revenue of $0.7 million, a 5% sequential increase from Q1 2022, and a 378% increase compared to $142,448 during the same period last year. * During Q2 2022, clients received a total of 5,320 appointments through Numinus clinics (including one-on-one and group therapy sessions, neurology-related appointments and Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy), representing a 14% decline in clinic appointments compared to Q1 2022 due to the anticipated seasonal slowdown during December holidays. On a same-store basis, excluding NCT (the acquisition of which completed partway through Q1 2022), client appointments declined 11% compared to Q1 2022. * As of April 14, 2022, Numinus has five wellness clinics offering services to clients (one in Vancouver, one in Toronto, and three in Montreal) that have a total of 21 treatment rooms. In addition, the Company has two dedicated research clinics where psychedelic studies are being conducted (one in Vancouver and one in Montreal). * Numinus is pleased to announce that it will be opening a new flagship wellness clinic location in Vancouver, Canada, during the late summer or early fall of 2022. Clinical Trials * On January 19, 2022, Numinus announced that it had received approvals from Health Canada and the Institutional Review Board to proceed with its clinical trial study for MAPS-sponsored MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD clinical trial study (""MAPPUSX""). Enrollment for the trial is open to eligible participants who were previously enrolled in the placebo arm of the parent study (""MAPP1"") or who were not able to receive treatment due to COVID-19 restrictions. * On March 30, 2022, the Company announced that it has advanced to the implementation phase of the MAPPUSX trial, by enrolling and dosing the first clinical trial volunteer in Canada. * Numinus Bioscience has discovered an additional drug product candidate, NBIO-03, that is nearing the final stages of development. The Company now intends to include NBIO-03 in the Phase 1 clinical trial alongside NBIO-01 to establish a maximum tolerated dose. As a result of this new opportunity, Numinus will resubmit its clinical trial application to Health Canada in the next several months to reflect the redefined scope of this study. Numinus Bioscience ï¿½?Laboratory Operations * Q2 2022 revenue of $105,966, a 26% sequential decrease from Q1 2022, but a 19% increase from $89,059 in Q2 2021. During Q2 2022 product shipping challenges impacted the timing of analytical testing services performed for third party clients, which affected the timing of revenue recognition. The Company expects some services intended to be performed during Q2 2022 will now be completed in Q3 2022. * During Q2 2022, Numinus Bioscience secured several additional strains of psychedelic mushroom species and has already begun genomic analysis of these spore prints for research purposes. * On February 1, 2022, Numinus announced that it had added three key advisors to its new Bioscience Advisory Board: Graham Pechenik (JD) ï¿½?Patent Attorney & Founder, Calyx Law, Dr. Paul Spagnuolo (PhD) ï¿½?Associate Professor, University of Guelph, and Dr. Cory Harris (PhD) ï¿½?Associate Professor, University of Ottawa. * On March 9, 2022, the Company announced hat it has received approval from Health Canada to study Ayahuasca and San Pedro. * On March 14, 2022, Numinus Bioscience announced it was approved for a Containment Level 2 (""CL2"") license by the Public Health Agency of Canada. With the license, Numinus Bioscience will begin: * The study of pathogens and bacterial, fungal and microbial contaminants to identify baseline markers and optimal growth environments for Psilocybe mushrooms; * Bioassay studies using mammalian cell lines, to analyze the bioactivity of different whole mushroom formulations that contain both psilocybin and other psychedelic compounds; and * Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pre-clinical studies using analysis of blood and other bodily fluids, to investigate reactions in the human body to whole mushrooms and other natural formulations. * As a result of the pending proposed acquisition of Novamind and the two additional clinic research facilities the Company will gain as a result of this expansion, Numinus Bioscience has decided to halt its planned research facility expansion in Nanaimo, B.C. The Company believes diversifying its research capabilities across both Canada and the U.S. will better serve Numinus' contract research clients and long-term strategy. Corporate Updates * On December 16, 2021, Numinus graduated to the TSX (from the TSX-Venture), trading under the symbol ""NUMI"". * On January 27, 2022, the Company graduated to the OTCQXÂ® Best Market in the United States, as a first step towards establishing a greater profile with the U.S. investment community. * On February 28, 2022, Numinus held its Annual General and Special Meeting of Shareholders, where all proposed Directors were elected to its Board, and all other resolutions were approved by shareholders. * On April 12, 2022, Numinus announced the proposed acquisition of Novamind ï¿½?which will position Numinus as a leading, integrated mental healthcare company providing psychedelic-assisted therapies ï¿½?with 13 wellness clinics and approximately $10 million of combined proforma annual revenue. * The companies have entered into an arrangement agreement (the ""Arrangement Agreement"") dated April 12, 2022, pursuant to which Numinus will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Novamind by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act, for total valuation of approximately $26.2 million on a fully diluted in-the-money basis. * Under the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, shareholders of Novamind will receive 0.84 of a common share of Numinus for each Novamind share held, implying an offer price of $0.44 per Novamind share. * Transaction is expected to close in June 2022 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals of the shareholders of Numinus and Novamind and approval of the TSX. * Numinus is beginning the process to apply to the SEC for a listing on a major US stock exchange and it is targeting to have the listing completed by the Fall of 2022. While the Company is well capitalized, it would only contemplate additional financing opportunities if it makes strategic sense.

475,0,Sweden extends pandemic curbs by two weeks amid record Omicron spread,234 words,Reuters News,"""We have an extremely high level of spread,"" Health Minister Lena Hallengren told a news conference. ""The restrictions must remain in place for two weeks. If everything goes as planned and if the situation allows, the restrictions will be lifted after that."" Sweden has seen some 270,000 confirmed cases in the last seven days but limited testing means the health agency believes the real number could be over half a million. The spread has put strain on the healthcare system but much less than during previous waves. The number of patients treated in intensive care have been between 90 and 120 people for the past four weeks. Sweden stood out early in the pandemic by opting against lockdowns, instead relying on voluntary measures focused on social distancing and good hygiene. It has seen deaths per capita much higher than Nordic neighbours but lower than most European countries that opted for lockdowns.

73,1,'Lots of jobs need to be filled',963 words,Austin American-Statesman,"Austin has been the best-performing major metro area in the country in terms of recovering and exceeding its pre-pandemic employment levels, according to federal statistics compiled by the Austin Chamber of Commerce. The number of people working in the region in February was up 6.3% ï¿½?or by 71,500 ï¿½?compared with February 2020, just before the coronavirus sent business activity into a deep freeze nationwide and triggered widespread layoffs, the figures show. The Dallas area, with a 4.7% gain in jobs, was in second place among the Top 50 U.S. metro areas over that time. The trend has dropped Austin's unemployment rate to near pre-pandemic levels, even though the local labor force has swelled significantly as people have flocked to the area. ""It's been the same refrain ï¿½?people are still moving here and it is still very much a desirable place to be,"" said Matt Patton, an economist with Austin-based Angelou Economics. ""Then you add on recent announcements by companies like Tesla and Samsung, and now we've got rumblings going on in Hutto about expansion there"" by tech firm Applied Materials. The upshot is ""there are going to be lots of jobs that need to be filled"" for the foreseeable future, Patton said. Unadjusted for seasonal factors, the local unemployment rate came in at 3.3% in February, putting it within striking distance of its 2.6% level in the same month two years ago despite the addition of nearly 91,000 workers to the regional labor force since then. The unemployment rate in the Austin metro area ï¿½?which includes Travis, Williamson, Hays, Bastrop and Caldwell counties ï¿½?had shot up to 11.2% in April 2020 amid the initial shock of the coronavirus before beginning to recover. Employers must 'get creative' A string of major economic development wins just before and during the pandemic have helped the region regain its economic footing and elevated its profile nationally. They include electric automaker Tesla's new $1.1 billion Travis County factory that started production in December, as well as the company's decision last October to relocate its headquarters here. In addition, chipmaker Samsung said in November that it will build a $17 billion manufacturing plant in Taylor, a Williamson County suburb of Austin, while software giant Oracle announced in December 2020 that it was moving its corporate headquarters to Austin. Apple, meanwhile, is nearing completion of a $1 billion corporate campus in North Austin that it announced in late 2018.  Applied Materials, a top supplier of equipment and services to the global semiconductor industry, might join that list of prominent names over the next few months. The company has said it's considering Hutto, another suburb of Austin that's in Williamson County, for a possible $2.4 billion research and development facility.  Tesla and Apple ï¿½?which have been advertising hundreds of job openings in Austin ï¿½?have already entered what has been a scramble by local employers to hire enough workers amid the region's stretched labor force. But even companies that have merely announced projects without beginning to hire for them yet are affecting the local job market, experts say. ""If you are an employer and you look on the horizon and see there is going to be competition (for skilled labor in your industry), you want to do everything you can to keep those workers,"" said Tamara Atkinson, CEO of Workforce Solutions Capital Area. ""It's simple supply and demand,"" she said. ""Employers are really having to get creative."" Atkinson said she doesn't recall a time when local employers seeking to hire and retain workers have been more willing to negotiate around issues such as salary, bonus, flexible scheduling and opportunities for training and career advancement. She has headed the regional workforce agency for about five years but said she's been involved in workforce development in the Austin area for more than two decades. ""I have never seen a situation like we have now,"" Atkinson said. Growth's impact on economy Patton, of Angelou Economics, said the flood of new and expanding businesses in the region ï¿½?and the influx of people moving here and requiring housing and other infrastructure ï¿½?has been reverberating throughout the local economy and fueling demand for many different categories of workers. ""In an indirect way, (even the announcements of new projects) affects things right now"" in the job market because it takes time to prepare for them, he said. He pointed to homebuilders as an example, saying more skilled construction workers are needed in anticipation of new residents even though ""we already have a shortage of teams that are able to build housing"" for current demand. While Austin's economy was also hitting on all cylinders just before the pandemic struck, Patton said the growth is different now in that it's transforming a number of suburban areas outside of the city that didn't participate significantly in prior booms. Likewise, Atkinson said it's a great time for residents of the region to do the same ï¿½?by acquiring the skills necessary to obtain better-paying jobs that are more fulfilling and have more opportunities for career advancement. She urged people to contact her agency, which works with local companies as well as Austin Community College and multiple nonprofit organizations to provide services such as skills training and access to paid internship programs and scholarship money."

866,1,*S&PGR Affirms CAS Holding 'BBB-' Ratings; Outlook Negative,1960 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"The following is a press release from S&P Global Ratings: -- CAS Holding No.1 Ltd.'s (CAS Holding) leverage will likely stay high but stable over the next two years due to the recognition of spectrum liabilities in 2021, large shareholder distributions, and investments in new businesses. We forecast the company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be 4.2x-4.4x in the period, compared with 4.2x in 2021. -- Meanwhile, the leverage of PCCW Ltd. (CAS Holding's parent) is set to stabilize at about 4.5x over the next two to three years. -- At the same time, CAS Holding should continue to have stable operating cash flows, given its strong positioning in the Hong Kong telecom segment. The company's more stringent cost controls will likely offset challenges stemming from the resurgence of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. -- On April 14, 2022, S&P Global Ratings affirmed its 'BBB-' long-term issuer credit rating on CAS Holding and 'BB' long-term issue rating on the perpetual subordinated securities the company guarantees. -- The stable outlook reflects our view that CAS will maintain stable profitability and leverage over the next two years. HONG KONG (S&P Global Ratings) April 14, 2022--S&P Global Ratings today took the rating actions listed above. CAS Holding and PCCW's leverage is likely to remain high but stable over the next 24 months. We estimate CAS Holding's debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be 4.2x-4.4x over the next two years owing to high dividend payouts and ongoing spending on new business development. The leverage ratio reached 4.2x in 2021 due to recognition of HK$3.3 billion in spectrum liabilities. Based on the company's recent record of spectrum bidding, such significant adjustments are unlikely in the next few years. CAS Holding's dividend payments are likely to remain high as a percentage of its free cash flow, as mandated by its trust structure. The company would also need HK$1.8 billion-HK$2.3 billion investments annually in software for new business development. CAS Holding is committed to incubating businesses such as e-commerce and fintech. These initiatives should bring good growth momentum, but the new businesses will likely remain loss-making for the next two years. Meanwhile, the leverage of PCCW is set to stabilize at about 4.5x over the next two years. This reflects CAS Holding's rising leverage and other investments in the group's media and solutions businesses. We believe profitability of the media businesses will continue to improve following the successful turnaround of Free TV and significant reduction in losses in over-the-top video services. CAS Holding should maintain stable business performance amid the resurgence of COVID-19 in Hong Kong As a market leader, the company is well positioned to capture upside from accelerating digitalization over a long term, despite near-term challenges posed by the pandemic. We forecast revenue will dip by up to 3% in 2022. Lower revenues from roaming, handset and network equipment, and advertising due to COVID restrictions would offset the benefits of rising 5G penetration and robust data-related services. CAS Holding's revenue could increase by 1%-3% in 2023 if the COVID situation improves in the second half of this year. Losses from CAS Holding's new businesses could continue to stay high. We estimate such losses, together with expenditure on corporate support functions, would total HK$0.8 billion-HK$1.0 billion annually over the next two years. Cost saving from efficiency improvement efforts and digitalization could temper the impact. We expect CAS Holding's EBITDA margin to stabilize at 35%-37% in the period, compared with 36.0% in 2021. CAS Holding's credit profile is aligned with that of PCCW. We continue to view CAS Holding as a core subsidiary of PCCW because it holds the parent's entire interest (51.94%) in HKT Trust and HKT Ltd. (HKT Trust) and Hong Kong Telecommunications (HKT) Ltd. (HKT; BBB/Stable/--). As an immediate parent of HKT Trust, CAS Holding sits outside of the subsidiary's trust structure. Therefore, CAS Holding is subject to PCCW's financial policy and credit risk exposure. The stable outlook on CAS Holding is based on our view that PCCW's debt leverage will stay at 4.5x or below over the next two years. We believe PCCW will closely monitor its financial policy and leverage. We could lower the rating on CAS Holding if PCCW's leverage rises above 4.5x on a sustained basis. This could happen if the operating performance of PCCW or CAS Holding's key subsidiaries HKT and HKT Trust deteriorates materially or if the companies make debt-funded investments and dividend payments increase significantly beyond our base case. The upside potential is limited for CAS Holding. However, we could upgrade the company if PCCW's leverage constantly stays below 3.5x. This could happen if PCCW: (1) adopts a more conservative leverage tolerance and executes ambitious deleveraging initiatives with stringent dividend policy or equity financing; and (2) significantly improves profitability of its businesses.

107,0,Tourism blow as $800m Sydney CBD hotel knocked back,819 words,The Australian,"The hospitality industry is making a slow recovery in cities after the pandemic and is dealing with a spike in Covid-19 cases due to a new variant but has called for more new hotels to be open so the country remains competitive. Sydney has seen few city hotels open and the W Hotel announced for the Ribbon development in Darling Harbour in mid-2018 has been beset by delays with the collapse of two builders, Grocon and Probuild. Another mooted CBD hotel site in Bligh St is now being sold off as a revamped office block. Prior to the pandemic, local group Fortius and Singapore-based SC Capital explored pre-selling a proposed $700m hotel and office block on the property. Built and Irongate proposed a redevelopment that would have seen a luxury hotel mixed use project rise at 52 Phillip St and the Â­adjacent heritage-listed building at 50 Phillip St. The plan hinged on Builtâs unsolicited proposal to the NSW government for the leasehold purchase of 50 Phillip St. It was submitted in 2017 and had gone to the second stage by October 2019 with the developers amending plans for the sensitive site where the hotel would adjoin the historic Chief Secretaryâs Building. But their proposal was quietly knocked back last year, prompting surprise after the same state process had previously been used to allow Crownâs casino complex at Barangaroo and Macquarieâs office towers above Martin Place metro station without tenders. The proponents had worked closely with the government to craft their project around the areaâs unique heritage elements and gained significant support from inside the government up to former premier Gladys BereÂ­jiklian, who had declared it needed to happen to show that Sydney was open to the world. But the quiet decision to reject the proposal effectively ended its hopes, leaving the developers with estimated costs of close to $5m and the international investors behind the project, as well as a trio of global hoteliers who were vying to run the project, hanging. The proponents have declined to comment publicly on the project but there are concerns that hotel chains will be deterred from committing to Sydney due to planning uncertainty and international real estate investors may also factor in greater sovereign risk when investing in NSW. The Department of Premier & Cabinet confirmed the proposal had not proceeded âpast Stage 2ï¿½? Industry players suggested the premier held concerns about the heritage considerations in the district as the hotel and residences would border the Chief Secretaryâs Building but it was to be protected under the scheme. A 2021 report by former prime minister Paul Keating and former Sydney lord mayor Lucy Turnbull, who were commissioned by the NSW government to review how the area known as Macquarie Street East, has influenced planning around the area. They argued the precinct should be revitalised into a world-class cultural destination on par with New York and London and the Chief Secretaryâs Building should be returned to its original purpose as a government office. Builtâs plans had included careful heritage preservation and adaptive re-use of 50 Phillip Street, drawing on the firmâs unique skills in such projects and tapping heritage specialist Graham Brooks to advise. The developer has a record in developing heritage projects including Sub Station No. 164 at 185 Clarence Street and is also delivering the redevelopment of the former Education and Lands buildings on Bridge Street. The project had included 240 hotel rooms, a rooftop pool and 16 luxury hotel-branded residences. The federal government has been campaigning on the opening of international borders and state governments have declared that cities are open with hotels a key part of that strategy. Some are opening up. The countryâs first Kimpton Hotel opened in Sydney last month, ahead of an expected national roll out of the luxury branded hotel chain, after new owner Pro-Invest picked up the hotel from Chinaâs Greenland Group. The Shenzhen-based owners of One Circular Quay are also readying to launch an apartment project, with a penthouse priced at more than $100m, and a luxury Waldorf Astoria Â­Hotels and Resorts in the adjoining tower on the former Goldfields House site. The Bligh Street site now being sold as a $200m office block via McVay Real Estate and JLL had been billed as a 421-room hotel."

315,0,Meituan Shows China Tech Isn't Delivering Yet -- Heard on the Street -- WSJ,505 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"Friday's policy guidelines, from the state economic planner and 13 other government bodies, aim to help industries that have been hit hard by the pandemic such as restaurants and retail. The guidelines also include other measures meant to support the service sector like tax breaks and subsidies. China's retail sales have been lagging behind other drivers of economic growth. Small- and medium-size businesses are doing particularly poorly. There is no mention of how, or for how long online food-delivery platforms should cut fees. Meituan's take of every dollar spent on food delivery on its platform in the third quarter of 2021 was around 13.4%. Morgan Stanley estimates that a one-percentage-point drop in that monetization rate would lower Meituan's overall food-delivery revenue by 7%. Meituan made more than half of its revenue from food delivery in the third quarter, though its higher-margin hotel and travel segment delivered higher profits. The market may be overreacting if this proves to be only a short-term measure to shore up struggling restaurateurs. Meituan provided subsidies and rebates to its merchants at the outset of China's initial Covid-19 outbreak in 2020, but its sales quickly recovered after the pandemic there came under control. But investors seem to be taking away a harsher message. Other Chinese technology stocks, which shouldn't really see much direct impact from the new guidelines have fallen too. Alibaba and Tencent have both dropped around 7% in the past two trading days. Predicting consumer-technology companies' long-term growth and profits obviously becomes more difficult if their pursuit clashes with other high-level objectives of Beijing, such as curbing large private conglomerates' market power. Such worries were, of course, behind the precipitous declines in Chinese tech stocks last year. These new guidelines show shares aren't out of the woods yet by any means. Moreover, with China apparently prepared to stick with its ""zero-Covid"" approach for quite some time still, service-sector consumption in general could be a long time recovering. China's tech sector had been relatively resilient this year compared with the carnage in the U.S. Now investors are realizing they may have been too complacent: Regulatory risks clearly aren't going away yet.

223,0,Richmond hotel restaurant Bruno struggles to please all,1043 words,The Globe and Mail,"RICHMOND Phone: 604-242-2750 Website: versantehotel.com/taste Cuisine: Opulent West Coast sharing plates Prices: Dinner: small plates, $12 to $38; large plates, $28 to $32; platters, $58 to $215; full-board experience, $125 a person (two people minimum). Seafood brunch: $59. Additional information: Open daily for breakfast, weekday lunch, weekend brunch and dinner. Reservations recommended. No takeout or patio. At around 9 p.m. on a recent Saturday night, the dinner guests at Bruno burst into spontaneous applause. They weren't clapping for executive chef William Lew, even though many of his dishes, presented on driftwood platters and under billows of smoke, are highly theatrical. Or the suave service from general manager Alessandro De Pieri and head waiter Ricardo Buyayo, who spins around the floor with arm twirls, heel kicks and the confident pizzazz of a Las Vegas showman. Or even the fact that Bruno, located in the new boutique Versante Hotel, is Richmond's only upscale Western restaurant of note now that the Origo Club is closed. The dinner guests were clapping because the blazing overhead lights had finally been dimmed, casting welcome shadows into shiny corners and making the white-lacquered room look a little less like a cafeteria. Hotel restaurants have the toughest job. Bruno, like others, is trying hard to be many things: fine-dining destination, daytime hangout for locals and accessible eatery for hotel guests (serving breakfast, lunch, weekend brunch and dinner). On top of all this, Bruno faces the challenge of appeasing Chinese customs while also being approachable to a wider clientele. The lighting issue can be chalked up to cultural differences. Chinese restaurants are often brightly lit because Chinese people enjoy dining in a lively, loud, happy atmosphere. In Cantonese, the word for this is yeet lau, which, roughly translated, means hot festivity. Bruno, located in the most Chinese city in the world outside of Asia, must accommodate those preferences. And this new hotel, which is adjoined to the International Trade Centre, is owned by the Changzhou-born, Vancouverbased property developer Michael Ching, who probably has many of his own preferences to boot. That said, traditions are changing and some of the diners applauding that night were actually Chinese. There are other food issues at Bruno that can't be so easily explained. Bruno doesn't call itself a farmto-table restaurant. This is probably only because all restaurants are trying to avoid that tired phrase these days. But its marketing materials do prominently reference âthe influence of local farms and food artisans that supply its ingredients"" and a desire to âshowcase the best of British Columbia"" in each dish. And Mr. Lew, who was previously chef de cuisine at Notch 8 in the Fairmont Vancouver Hotel, is definitely trying to make visceral connections from tongue to terroir with his creative plating ï¿½?some more successfully than others. Local oysters, farmed near Mr. Ching's coming hotel developments in the Comox Valley, are presented on a kelp-draped log anchored to the plate with edible sand made from dried nori. (For now, I will gloss over the fact the XO mignonette, which contains neither dried seafood nor Jinhua ham, is really just a chili crisp, not an XO sauce.) Truffle lavender duck (nicely cooked but slightly tough and puffy, likely because the Fraser Valley duck isn't organic) is a rich, foie-gras-spackled ode to the glamping domes on Mr. Ching's Cortes Island lavender farm, served in a picnic basket. Stanley Park is a nickname for The Iberico Tree, an elaborate display of hand-carved Cinco Jotas Bellota ham, hanging from slender branches planted in candied hazelnut soil with NeufchÃ¢tel tartlets tucked in a lofted nest. (This one is trying way too hard.) So why is a kitchen deeply committed to the local bounty and sense of place offering tasteless green tomatoes (on the otherwise nicely textured fall burrata salad) and white-bellied strawberries (on cakey, precooked Liege waffles served at brunch) in February? There is no justification for any decent restaurant, no matter what it calls itself, to have those ingredients (most likely sourced from Mexico and California) on plates right now. And Mr. Lew, who is the former Ocean Wise chef for its sustainable seafood program, should know better. Bruno is trying hard, very hard, to impress with its tableside razzle-dazzle and luxury ingredients. Some of it is wonderful. The kurobuta pork belly, presented under a smoking glass lid, is beautifully marinated in Asian aromatics, deep-fried for a crackling shell and glazed in sticky black garlic while still sizzling. Flakey, pull-apart croissant scrolls, flecked with rosemary and pecorino, are irresistible, especially when paired with a side of brÃ»lÃ©e foie-gras butter. But in its obvious attempt to capture the Instagram generation's attention, the kitchen misses some of the basics. The risotto, folded with uni, crowned with king crab and bejewelled with ikura, is overcooked and soft. At the lavish seafood brunch (an exceptional deal at $59 with optional buck-a-shuck-oysters), the English muffins for eggs benedict are cold and untoasted while the salmon-lobster topping is pulverized into a mush that looks like it came out of a can. There is potential here, but for now it feels superficial. Much like the hotel itself, which features dramatically designed rooms with huge soaker tubs enclosed in their own heated shower rooms, but no sound-proofing, robes, hot water (it took 10 minutes to heat up in the morning) or room service. I had a much better experience at Cask Whisky Bar, which is very dimly lit and located next door in the trade centre. And I'll write about that soon. But there are another three restaurants opening next door. Mr. Lew is overseeing all of them. This isn't just a hotel, it's a complex. I'm afraid he might be stretched too thin. I hope he has a lot of help, because I'd hate to see him booed off the stage."

111,0,UPDATE1: Japan's COVID quasi-emergency to completely end: PM Kishida,305 words,Kyodo News,"The planned lifting on Monday would mean that the strain on hospitals has eased, though the downtrend in COVID-19 cases has been slower than expected in some areas. Kishida has indicated that the government will take steps toward an ""exit"" from the anti-virus measures while securing sufficient vaccine doses, test kits and treatment drugs in preparation for possible infections driven new variants in the future. The 18 areas include the Tokyo metropolitan region, including Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama, Aichi in central Japan, Osaka and neighboring Kyoto. A formal decision on ending the emergency is expected Thursday. Tokyo reported 10,221 cases Wednesday, down around 600 from a week earlier. While many people infected with Omicron show no or mild symptoms, the spread of the BA.2 subvariant, which appears to be more contagious, has raised concern about a resurgence of cases that could stretch the health care system further. Under new government guidelines, a quasi-emergency can be lifted when the strain on the health care system is expected to ease despite infection numbers staying at high levels. Even when the occupancy rate of designated beds is above 50 percent, the government can end emergency steps if the number of newly confirmed cases is on a downtrend. ==Kyodo"

742,0,NSO turns to U.S. Supreme Court for immunity in WhatsApp suit,718 words,Yedioth Ahronoth,"NSO is seeking to have the entire case dismissed. In its petition, NSO said that lower courts have given mixed opinions on sovereign immunity over the years and that it was crucial for the Supreme Court to rule on an issue that has great national security implications for governments around the world. ""Many nations, including the United States, rely on private contractors to conduct or support core governmental activities,"" it wrote in the April 6 filing. ""If such contractors can never seek immunity ï¿½?then the United States and other countries may soon find their military and intelligence operations disrupted by lawsuits against their agents."" NSO's flagship product, Pegasus, allows operators to covertly infiltrate a target's mobile phone, gaining access to messages and contacts, the camera and microphone and location history. It says that it sells the product only to government law enforcement agencies to catch criminals and terrorists and that all sales are approved by Israel's Defense Ministry. It does not identify its clients. But critics say a number of clients, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Poland, have abused the system to snoop on critics and stifle dissent. WhatsApp says at least 100 of the users connected to its lawsuit were journalists, rights activists and civil society members. NSO says it has no control over how its clients use the product and no access to the data they collect, though it claims it has safeguards in place to prevent abuses. Critics say the safeguards are insufficient. ""NSO's spyware invades the rights of citizens, journalists, and human rights activists around the globe and their attacks must be stopped,"" WhatsApp said in a statement. ""Two United States courts have already rejected NSO's contrived bid for immunity and we believe there is no reason for the Supreme Court to hear their last-ditch attempt to avoid accountability,"" it said, adding that multiple human rights groups and tech companies have said granting immunity to spyware companies ""would be dangerous for the world."" The WhatsApp case is among a series of legal battles plaguing NSO. Apple last year filed a lawsuit that it says aims to prevent NSO from breaking into products. It claimed Pegasus had affected a small number of iPhone users worldwide, calling NSO's employees ""amoral 21st-century mercenaries."" NSO last year also was blacklisted by the U.S. Commerce Department, limiting its access to U.S. technology. U.S. officials said the company's products were complicit in ""transnational repression."" NSO appears to face a formidable challenge. For starters, the Supreme Court agrees to consider just 1% or so of the requests put before it. It could be months before the court decides whether to review the case. But even if it does, NSO would have to convince the court that it is a state agent and entitled to immunity. Eugene Kontorovich, an Israeli-American professor at the George Mason University Scalia Law School and director of its Center for the Middle East and International Law, said it was a ""very interesting"" and ""very serious"" case. But he said he was skeptical NSO would prevail. ""They're a software company. They create a product that's been licensed to foreign governments and which governments can use,"" he said. ""An agent usually is something of a much higher standard."""
485,0,"New York's Beleaguered Hotel Industry Braces for Even More Hotels; Property openings show no signs of slowing even as occupancy, room rates lag",886 words,The Wall Street Journal Online,"Hotel operators and developers were drawn to the city's strong economy and growing tourism sector in the years before Covid-19[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/coronavirus-case-count-11594333471]. In the decade leading up to the pandemic, New York City added more than 41,000 hotel rooms, increasing the city's room count by 47%. Business travel and tourism cratered during the pandemic and many hotels are struggling to sell rooms. But even lackluster demand hasn't derailed hotel construction. There were 121 hotels in the New York pipeline as of the fourth quarter, which would add more than 19,000 rooms in the coming years, Lodging Econometrics said. Hotels scheduled to open this spring include a Ritz-Carlton location in Manhattan's NoMad neighborhood north of Madison Square Park, and Aman New York[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/manhattan-home-at-aman-new-york-in-contract-for-55-million-11639080075], a luxury hotel and residences in the historic Crown Building on Fifth Avenue. Some hoteliers say they are looking beyond the pandemic, confident that demand from tourists and business travelers will eventually recover. ""We're not deterred,"" said Brett Blass, chief operating officer for Triumph Hotels, which operates six Manhattan hotels and is open to adding more. ""We believe in New York."" Yet hotel analysts caution that building more rooms could exacerbate the industry's woes by boosting supply at a time of depressed demand. International and business travel are two key pillars of hotel demand in New York, and the disruptions caused by the Omicron variant[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/after-two-weeks-of-flight-cancellations-airlines-assess-what-went-wrong-11641551402] have further delayed the return of these customers. New York hotel occupancy rates averaged about 59% last year compared with 86% in 2019, according to preliminary estimates from hotel-analytics firm STR. Annual revenue per available room, a key metric for hotels' bottom lines, reached only 57% of 2019 levels. ""Certainly the last thing New York really needs are new hotel rooms opening up during a crisis,"" said Patrick Scholes, a lodging analyst with Truist Securities Inc. Atit Jariwala, chief executive of Bridgeton Holdings, said robust leisure travel had been powering his two Manhattan hotels toward a strong holiday season until Omicron emerged. Flight cancellations, customer fears over rising Covid-19 cases and infections among hotel staff roiled business in the final weeks of 2021. His Walker Hotel Greenwich Village ended December with occupancy at 85%, he said, a strong showing compared with the citywide average, but still 10 percentage points behind what Mr. Jariwala had been expecting as of late November. Cancellations have continued into January, already a slow time for New York City hotels, he added. Even so, Bridgeton is among the many owners expanding in New York. The company recently won a bid for a Brooklyn hotel that was in foreclosure. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS When was the last time you stayed in a hotel? Join the conversation below. Dozens of New York City hotels closed permanently during the pandemic, and many others closed for extended periods. But a fair number of properties have reopened in recent months, and there are now just 6.7% fewer hotel rooms in operation than there were in January 2020, according to STR data. ""It's been a slower recovery for New York,"" said Carter Wilson, senior-vice president at STR. ""But it's on the right path."" One factor that could slow the pace of new hotel openings is industry regulation. Late last year, then-Mayor Bill de Blasio and the City Council implemented several new restrictions on hotels, including a requirement that hotel owners pay severance to laid-off employees if their properties remained closed past Nov. 1. Another law requires operators to receive special approval from the City Planning Commission before building or expanding hotels. ""I do think it will put a dent in the pipeline,"" Mr. Jariwala said. Concerns over the glut in hotel rooms began before the pandemic[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/SB10001424052702304441404579121911381744056], as competition from new developments and short-term rental websites like Airbnb Inc. put downward pressure on room rates and prompted several owners to default[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/defaults-are-rising-in-sluggish-new-york-city-hotel-market-11582027204]on their mortgages. Jason Halpern of JMH Development became so worried about the number of new hotels opening in Manhattan that he scrapped plans in late 2019 to build two-limited service hotels in Queens near LaGuardia Airport. ""We were shovel ready to build the hotels,"" Mr. Halpern said. His group had spent more than $4 million on costs related to the hotels, he added, before deciding to change course. But Mr. Halpern has no regrets. The developer ultimately built a 143-unit residential building, The Astor LIC, which is now fully leased.

62,0,Shanghai's Disney resort shut amid record daily local COVID infections,612 words,Reuters News,"It is the fourth consecutive day that Shanghai's local asymptomatic infections have increased. Although the tally of infections is tiny by global standards, Shanghai has quickly followed China's ""dynamic clearance"" policies, shutting schools and testing residential compounds in the effort to limit the spread of the virus. ""When it comes to the entire situation of epidemic control and prevention that we are facing, it is very complex and serious, and it is also a very big test for us,"" city health official Wu Jinglei told a news briefing. Shanghai will stick with ""dynamic clearance"", Wu added, saying he hoped for continued public support for the policy. The city also shut the Shanghai Disney Resort from Monday until further notice. But there were signs of frustration with the city's ad hoc, district-by-district approach. ""Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen have had three different epidemic response models,"" said a user of China's Twitter-like Weibo network. ""Hong Kong is the worst but will be the first to open up,"" the writer, going by the name zangyn, said in a widely shared post. ""Shenzhen is the most effective, and Shanghai may be the most tiring, and even the most miserable."" The severity of outbreak responses by Shanghai's compounds and residential districts varied, with some opting for lockdowns as long as two weeks. Some people in other sealed-off districts said they were not told how long they would have to stay home. Residents' committees helping to organise testing programmes also encountered challenges. One compound distributed tokens to foil outsiders' attempts to take free tests. Including Shanghai infections, mainland China reported a total of 1,947 new locally transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms on Sunday, data from the National Health Commission (NHC) showed, up from 1,656 a day earlier. The top steelmaking city of Tangshan, with just 12 local infections since March. 19, is allowing only essential vehicles on roads smaller than expressways, while people with special needs who must use vehicles have to seek approval. The southern manufacturing hub of Shenzhen has allowed work and production activities, as well as bus and subway services in most areas, to resume after daily local case numbers dropped following three rounds of city-wide testing. Tight curbs remain in some places, however. Shenzhen residents still need to show negative tests in order to use public transport from Monday until March 27, a period in which non-essential indoor services will stay closed, the city government has said. Vaccine candidates to target Omicron specifically, or among variants of concern, are in studies prior to clinical trials, a national health official said on Saturday, without identifying the companies involved. China's new local asymptomatic cases, which it does not classify as confirmed cases, was 2,384, up from 2,177 a day earlier. The death toll was unchanged at 4,638, with no new deaths. By Sunday, mainland China had reported 132,226 cases with confirmed symptoms, both among locals and arrivals from outside.

8,0,"As Olympic torch is lit in hope, I see light at end of the tunnel",790 words,The Herald,"When Ivy League universities in America are closing their doors and sending students home until August, donât rule out the first cancellation of an Olympic Games since World War II.? The IOC and host nation Japan are still confident that the Games will go ahead as planned, but no one has any real idea on how long this might go on for. Just from athletes I have spoken to, there is definitely real concern over the Games. The concern isnât just over whether the games get cancelled or not. For each individual athlete, it is also over their own preparations. As an athlete, getting sick is never great and if you got this virus bad you might face missing weeks of training. It could result on you missing the podium in Tokyo.? Or missing the Games altogether. Another friend of mine told me of his concerns that if they move the Games then he might not even get selected.? With markets crashing and supermarket shelves being cleared, these are definitely interesting times for everybody. But when you are living during this Covid-19 pandemic with a spinal-cord injury I guess it becomes even more daunting ï¿½?as such an injury can remove your cough and sneeze reflex. With very little core function, the thought of not being able to cough is a pretty scary proposition.? This might not sound too bad. But this virus hits elderly people hard ï¿½?and this also includes your biological age due to underlying medical conditions. So this is a scary time, and I completely feel for everyone in the same boat as me how scary this is.?I remember back to catching the flu in November last year ï¿½?I thought I was going to stop breathing. I couldnât cough to clear my lungs as the level of my injury is right at the nerves which go to the lungs.? It knocked me out for weeks, so I would be lying if I said I wasnât slightly scared of Covid-19 and its possible effects on my lungs.? I am a very optimistic person who always looks for solutions over problems. But I must admit this has got me a little bit shaken.? Watching whatâs happening in Italy has been hard to believe ï¿½?particularly as life seemed to be continuing almost as normal here.? I looked at the MRI of a 44-year-old manâs lungs and it was unbelievable, unfortunately he didnât survive.? So I am staying positive but also taking advice from Austrian neurologist Viktor Frankl.?He speaks of acceptance of your current situation. These are his own words ï¿½?which I have had on my wall for the last four years: âThe meaning of life lies in finding a purpose and taking responsibility for ourselves and other human beings.ï¿½? In other words, by having a clear âwhyï¿½?we can face all the âhowï¿½?questions of life. This has got me through all those hours in hospital and continues to serve me daily.? Thereâs a reason that in-flight safety presentations always instruct us to secure our own oxygen masks before assisting fellow passengers. We canât help others effectively unless we first protect ourselves. So I spoke with a medical oncologist friend and they advised me to self-isolate.? I am now on day four and thinking this could be a long road ahead; thankfully the weather is getting warmer and I got out on my bike for a few laps of Richmond Park. Along with indoor turbo sessions I am well prepared mentally for the process. I guess all my time in hospital equipped my mind to deal with self-isolating. It also probably helps being an introvert.? I canât help but think of the poor people undergoing their cancer treatment right now though, as I prepare for my own hospital appointment in a few weeks, but I am grateful that side of things is under control. My main goal is keeping my immune system strong because another issue I have from my spinal-cord injury is a compromised immune system, thus moving me into a vulnerable group.? Itâs hard to go from a strong athlete to now feeling so vulnerable, but thankfully I have a strong mind."

737,0,Meta pondering appeal over DPC's ï¿½?7m fine for GDPR breaches,538 words,Irish Independent,"""This fine is about record keeping practices from 2018 that we have since updated, not a failure to protect people's information."" The Irish DPC's decision followed its inquiry into a series of 12 data breach notifications received between June and December in 2018. The DPC found that Meta infringed Articles 5(2) and 24(1) of GDPR, failing to ""have in place appropriate technical and organisational measures which would enable it to readily demonstrate the security measures that it implemented in practice to protect EU users' data, in the context of the 12 personal data breaches"". The DPC's draft decision, criticised by some commentators as amounting to little more than a ""rounding error"" in the context of Meta's annual revenue, was initially challenged by two other European supervisory authorities. However, these ""objections"" were overcome, according to Helen Dixon's office. The Meta spokesperson said that the fine was being ""considered"". ""We take our obligations under the GDPR seriously, and will carefully consider this decision as our processes continue to evolve,"" the spokesperson said. Separately, the DPC has sought to dispel what it describes as ""incomplete"" criticism that is ""lacking context"" about how it handles cross-border complaints. It published a statistical report on its handling of cross-border complaints under the GDPR's one-stopshop mechanism. The DPC report says that between the end of May in 2018 and the end of 2021, almost two thirds (65pc) of the cross-border complaints it handled as the lead supervisory authority have been concluded, with 82pc of those received in 2018 and 75pc in 2019 ""now concluded"". In total, the report says that 1,150 valid cross-border complaints were received by the DPC in that time, 969 (84pc) as lead supervisory authority and 181 (16pc) as a 'concerned supervisory authority'. The report says that of the 634 concluded cross-border complaints handled by the DPC as the lead, 544 were resolved through amicable resolution in the interests of the complainant. Last year, Austrian privacy campaigner Max Schrems told a joint Oireachtas committee that the Irish DPC had an ""extremely poor"" record at resolving complaints and that ""99pc of complaints are not decided"". The charge was rejected by Ms Dixon, calling the analysis ""simplistic"". The Irish authority currently has open inquiries into Meta, Google, Twitter, Apple, Yahoo and TikTok, among others. Its report says that 86pc of all cross-border complaints handled by the DPC as the lead relate to just 10 data controllers. Almost two thirds of the cross-border complaints handled by the DPC as the lead authority were originally lodged with another European data authority and transferred to the DPC, the report says. The DPC report says that ""a large number"" of the remaining open complaints from 2018 and 2019 are linked to an inquiry."

775,0,"Cyberattack on News Corp, Believed Linked to China, Targeted Emails of Journalists, Others--5th Update",1018 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"The attack, discovered on Jan. 20, affected a number of publications and business units including The Wall Street Journal and its parent Dow Jones; the New York Post; the company's U.K. news operation; and News Corp headquarters, according to an email the company sent to staff Friday.  News Corp said it notified law enforcement and hired cybersecurity firm Mandiant Inc. to support an investigation. A representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation said late Friday that it was aware of the incident. ""Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests,"" said David Wong, vice president of incident response at Mandiant.  News Corp disclosed the hack in a securities filing Friday, saying its preliminary analysis indicates that data was taken. A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said that China is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and ""firmly opposes and combats cyberattacks and cyber theft in all forms."" The spokesman, Liu Pengyu, said that identifying the source of cyberattacks is technically complex. ""We hope that there can be a professional, responsible and evidence-based approach to identifying cyber-related incidents, rather than making allegations based on speculations,"" Mr. Liu said. In the staff memo News Corp said it believes the threat activity is contained. The company has been offering guidance to affected employees. ""We are committed to protecting our journalists and sources. We will not be deterred from our purpose -- to provide uniquely trusted journalism and analysis. We will continue to publish the important stories of our time,"" said Almar Latour, chief executive of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal. The company's investigation indicates that systems housing financial and customer data, including subscriber information, weren't affected, according to the securities filing and a person familiar with the matter. The investigation detected that the intrusion appeared to date to at least February 2020, according to people briefed on the matter, and scores of employees were impacted. The hackers were able to access reporters' emails and Google Docs, including drafts of articles, the people said. News Corp was still trying to determine the full extent of emails and documents that were accessed, the people said. While the hackers accessed the Google system used by News Corp employees, there was no indication that they breached the system through a compromise at Google, said people briefed on the matter. Google's own systems weren't affected by the incident, a Google spokeswoman said. Reporters who were affected by the hack and were briefed on it expressed concerns to company officials about protecting their sources' identities. By Friday afternoon, many Journal reporters affected had been notified by company officials of specific documents that were believed to have been accessed. The attackers appeared to be interested in a range of topics, including issues of importance to Beijing such as Taiwan and China's Uyghur ethnic group, according to other people briefed on the matter and a review of some of the document target lists. Other areas of interest included draft Journal articles and notes about U.S. military troop activity, U.S. technology regulation related to China, and articles about President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and senior White House officials. The hackers also searched using keywords for emails related to traditional intelligence areas, including defense, one person familiar with the ongoing investigation said. Those searches in some cases appeared to be prompted by contemporary news developments. ""They would come back periodically,"" this person said. Law-enforcement officials and cybersecurity experts say that journalists are often high-priority targets for hackers seeking to gain intelligence on behalf of foreign governments, because they speak to sources who might have valuable or sensitive information. Powerful surveillance tools have been used against journalists and human-rights activists. U.S. authorities have accused China-based hackers for years of targeting a range of American businesses and government institutions. FBI Director Christopher Wray said this week that Beijing is running a ""massive, sophisticated hacking program that is bigger than those of every other major nation combined."" The FBI has more than 2,000 active investigations related to allegations of Chinese-government-directed theft of U.S. information or technology, Mr. Wray said. China has repeatedly denied allegations that it has carried out cyberattacks. In 2013, Chinese hackers trying to monitor news coverage of China hacked into the Journal's network, apparently aiming to spy on reporters covering China and other issues, the Journal reported. The New York Times had experienced a similar attack. At the time, a Chinese embassy spokesman condemned allegations of Chinese cyberspying and said Beijing prohibits cyberattacks. In February 2020, China revoked the press credentials of three Journal reporters based in Beijing. China's Foreign Ministry said the move was punishment for an opinion piece published by the Journal. The three journalists work for the Journal's news operation, which operates with a strict separation from the opinion staff. The following month, the Trump administration announced a personnel cap in the U.S. on four state-run Chinese media outlets. Later that March, China expelled from the country American journalists from multiple news organizations, including the Journal. In November 2021, each country agreed to ease visa restrictions for the other's reporters. The Journal was among a handful of U.S. outlets set to receive new press credentials for some staff.

167,0,Sanctions more than ethics have spurred corporate flight from Russia,910 words,Financial Times (FT.Com),"Many of the corporate exits from Russia have involved companies not directly affected by sanctions. The big name before yesterdayâs gaggle of fast food and caffeine purveyors was Shell, which announced it would stop buying Russian oil even before a US and UK ï¿½?still less an EU ï¿½?embargo was in place. Minds may have been concentrated by a genuinely principled act, union-backed workers refusing to offload Russian oil to the Stanlow refinery in north-west England formerly owned by Shell, which it still supplies. Perhaps Putin has inadvertently achieved what thousands of earnest environmental, social and governance investment codes could not, and prompted companies to bring binding ethical judgments into their supply chain decisions. Sadly, thatâs a bit far-fetched. Looking at their operations in Russia and elsewhere, most multinationals seem far more driven directly or indirectly by official sanctions than by sudden fits of corporate conscience. The appearance of voluntary action may arise because itâs not straightforward to map across specific European and US sanctions (for example, on banks and individuals) to companies ceasing Russian operations. Few Hollywood studios, car producers, furniture stores, or consumer goods manufacturers have been directly forbidden from dealing with Russia, unlike exporters of semiconductors and other sensitive tech. But it doesnât seem likely that the precision-made accuracy of US and European sanctions on Russia has made such an impact. Instead, itâs created an environment of such legal and financial hostility that risk-averse companies are staying clear. Being cancelled by indignant consumers is an important issue ï¿½?thatâs probably whatâs driving the McDonaldâs and Coca-Cola decisions ï¿½?but many corporates have more fundamental concerns. Will they unknowingly end up doing business with a sanctioned individual? Will they get prosecuted? Will they get paid? They might still earn profits in Russia, but can they get them out? The European sanctions on Russia are extraordinarily tough by historical standards, but the US remains by far the biggest player because of Washingtonâs control of the dollar payments system, including the Swift messaging facility and the long reach of correspondent banking. Compliance becomes so complicated that even if an activity or an entity isnât specifically sanctioned, any company wanting to retain access to the US banking and payments system needs a strong profit incentive to bother picking its way through the legal thicket. This is evident from Iran, where the USâs use of secondary sanctions ï¿½?which threaten disconnection from the dollar payments system for companies doing business with banned entities ï¿½?has deterred Europeans from transacting there. The EU, whose governments have a far less confrontational approach to relations with Tehran, has attempted legally to protect its companies via the so-called âblocking statuteï¿½? which prohibitsÂ them from complying with extraterritorial foreign sanctions that the EU regards as illegal under international law. The EU set up a quasi-barter system called Instex which enables them to transact with Iran outside the dollar system. And yet European companies are keeping business transactions with Iran minimal, for fear of being cut off from US banking. The idea that US and European companies are independently developing a moral aversion to human rights abuses withers when confronted with their continued activities in autocracies such as China and Saudi Arabia. Those governments arenât Putinâs Russia, but they do some pretty vile things, notably Saudiâs indiscriminate bombing of Yemeni civilians and China incarcerating a million Uyghurs in Xinjiang province. Both countries are generally unpopular with the American and European public and yet multinationals maintain strong links there. In the UK, the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich has decided to sell Chelsea FC, but a consortium led by Saudiâs sovereign wealth fund owns Newcastle United. Volkswagen has stopped producing in and exporting to Russia and wrung its hands piteously over violations of international law, but itâs still happily building cars in Xinjiang. McDonaldâs opened two restaurants in Xinjiang last year. The salient difference with Russia is that US and European governments arenât targeting Saudi and China with sanctions and turning public opinion further against them. Indeed, Joe Biden is reportedly asking Saudi Arabia to replace Russian oil. In Germany, a âdue diligenceï¿½?law making companies responsible for abuses in their supply chains ï¿½?which would have focused attention on their Chinese operations ï¿½?was watered down after pressure from German industry. The contrasting behaviour of rich world companies in different autocracies underlines that embargoes and boycotts donât generally just happen. Sanctions work when determined governments, particularly the US, weave dense webs of restrictions that warn companies to stay clear and lead public opinion towards the same conclusion. Jumping from Russia before you are pushed is self-interest: it is not an act of principle. alan.beattie@ft.com Sign up for Trade Secrets, the FTâs newsletter on globalisation"

486,1,'I may have to rethink my employment if that actually happens': Woke Twitter staff slam Elon Musk's $41billion offer for social media giant - as they enjoy 'focus week' with Monday off work and minimal meetings,2417 words,Mail Online,"* Miguel Barreto, a senior software engineer, went even further, saying 'I may have to rethink my employment if that actually happens' * Menotti Minutillo, a privacy engineer, joked 'first day of my PTO' * Ian Brown, a former employee, wrote: 'Every clown out there thinks they can drive the clown car better than the clowns currently behind the wheel.' * Celebrities, particularly conservatives, were all the more positive about the potential takeover While many Twitter users celebrated Elon Musk's $41billion hostile takeover attempt of the social media giant, the company's often progressive workforce bemoaned the potential buyout.  Twitter confirmed on Thursday that it had received the offer, saying in a statement: 'The Twitter Board of Directors will carefully review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the Company and all Twitter stockholders.' Musk, 50, insisted that his bid was his 'best and final offer', adding that 'if it is not accepted, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder,' a regulatory filing showed. His offer price of $54.20 per share represents a 38 percent premium to the closing price of Twitter's stock on April 1, the last trading day before the Tesla CEO publicly revealed his 9.2 percent stake in the company, sending the stock popping. The offer figure also includes the digits '420,' a reference to marijuana that Musk frequently jokes about. Haraldur Thorleifsson, a Twitter team lead who criticized Musk in the past despite having 'made me a lot of money,' merely said 'just go to therapy dude' in response to the news. Miguel Barreto, a senior software engineer, went further, saying, 'I may have to rethink my employment if that actually happens.' Menotti Minutillo, a privacy engineer, joked 'first day of my PTO' before adding more seriously: 'It is important to make deliberate space for folks to talk about extraordinary events - leaders, don't be afraid to address the clown in the room.' Ian Brown, a former Twitter employee, put it more succinctly: 'Every clown out there thinks they can drive the clown car better than the clowns currently behind the wheel.' Celebrities, particularly conservatives, were all the more positive about the potential takeover.  Sebastian Gorka, a former advisor to President Donald Trump, wrote that 'Elon is the G.O.A.T.', which stands for 'greatest of all time.'  Barstool CEO Dave Portnoy added: 'So Elon offered 41 billion to buy all of twitter. Now the Board decides if they want to sell it to him? Itâs a no brainer offer and theyâd all make a s--t ton. The only reason to say no is cause they donât like him right?' Even liberal comedian Michael Ian Black saw the positives, writing: 'Honestly, let Elon destroy Twitter - he'd be doing me a favor.' Last week, after news broke of the Tesla CEO's $3billion investment in the platform, employees took to Twitter issuing messages of both serious uneasiness and mockery. 'Good morning to our new overlord!' Lara Cohen, the company's Global Head of Partners, tweeted. Company researcher Matt DeMichiel shared a meme featuring rapper Drake that seemingly implied Musk would move the company's focus from growth, product innovation and sustainability to ways to further financial success. The billionaire, who initially filed a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure document intended for passive shareholders, filed a second form Tuesday indicating that he invested in the platform with the goal to evoke change. The new filing, which was obtained by DailyMail.com, revealed Musk began purchasing Twitter stock on January 31 and continued to buy shares during every trading session through April 1.  Twitter announced that Musk would hold a seat on the company's board of directors until the platform's 2024 annual shareholders meeting. In exchange, Musk - either alone or as a member of a group - is not allowed to push his stake in the company past 14.9 percent during the duration of his board membership and for 90 days after, according to Tuesday's SEC filing. However, Twitter employees appeared worried about company operations and values now that Musk seemingly holds significant weight in the company. Michael Sayman, a company product lead, took to the platform to share a meme allegedly depicting the next company board meeting. The post featured a group attending a meeting with Wario, the antagonist in Nintendo's Mario series, sitting at the head table. The meme was captioned: 'Twitter's next board meeting'. DeMichiel, who shared the Drake meme, also responded to a commenter asking if employees were required to include Musk on all work-related communications. He answered: 'That and all email signatures have to link to Tesla's website.' Although most responses featured targeted sarcasm, EJ Samson, a member of the platform's marketing team, issued a more neutral response, questioning Musk's role at the company. Retweeting a poll the SpaceX CEO had posted asking if users wanted an edit button, Samson replied, via meme: 'What is happening?' Musk issued several polls to his millions of followers on the social media platform on Saturday. The outspoken Tesla CEO, known for his social media antics, initially asked if he should transform the company's Silicon Valley headquarters into a homeless shelter, before suggesting the removal of the letter 'w' in Twitter. In the first post, Musk - who purchased a 9.2 percent stake in the social media giant earlier this week and was subsequently named to the company's board of directors - seemingly took aim at the company's lax remote working policies, saying he came up with the plan 'since no one shows up anyway.' So far, the results of the 24-hour poll, posted at 9:30 PM ET by the billionaire businessman, suggests overwhelming support for the prospective undertaking - with 91.1 percent of more than 923,459 respondents voting in favor of the plan. The second tweet about deleting 'w' saw Musk give two options without no as an answer, with 55.8 percent saying 'yes' and 44.2 percent 'of course' of 445,158 votes to-date. It comes weeks after Twitter brass - who offered staffers the option of working from home 'forever' during the pandemic - reopened its offices March 15, with remote work remaining an option for staffers. 'Itâs been almost two years since we closed our offices and travel and Iâm excited to announce that weâre ready to fully open up business travel and all our offices around the world!' Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal wrote in a note to employees posted to Twitter March 3. 'Business travel is back effective immediately, and office openings will start on March 15,' the exec wrote. In the statement, Agrawal, who was promoted to CEO of the San Francisco-based company in November, said that he would be honoring a policy put in place by former head exec Jack Dorsey during the early days of the pandemic, that said staffers could work remotely 'forever' if they wanted to. 'Our top priority since the beginning of the pandemic has been to keep you all safe and this will continue,' Agrawal wrote. 'Now we are returning to a stage where youâre living your lives, adjusting to local health guidelines, and deciding what works best for you. 'So, the decisions about where you work, whether you feel safe travelling for business, and what events you attend, should be yours,' the exec added, in a sentence this time set in bold. 'As we open back up, our approach remains the same,' Agrawal, 37, went on. 'Wherever you feel most productive and creative is where you will work and that include working from home full-time forever,' the CEO wrote, in another bolded sentence. 'Office every day? That works too. Some days in the office, some days from home? Of course.' Agrawal, however, warned that 'distributed working will be much, much harder' and said 'there will be lots of challenges' amid the new policy. Agrawal went on to tout the advantages of having staffers in the same physical space, where they can experience the 'company culture,' and said that visits to the office will 'bring that culture to life in such a powerful way.' The CEO then provided a signoff that seemed hopeful of staffers' desire to return to in-person work. 'I look forward to seeing you all back at the office or perhaps at an event, somewhere in your home city, or mine?' 'Cant' wait... Parag.' More than a month later, as Silicon Valley's tech workers are starting to filter back to the office as Covid-19 cases plummet, it looks as if the CEO's faith in staffers' desire to return to work in-person was misplaced - something new board member Musk seemed to hone in on with his evidently mocking post.  Google, for instance, told employees last month that it would begin requiring employees to return in person at least three days a week - a policy that went into effect this past week  Apple similarly announced that by April 11, employees will have to work from the office at least one day a week.  Twitter, meanwhile, has not issued any in-person requirements for its staffers - a decision Musk seemingly panned in his post. Prior to posting the poll, Musk also suggested further changes to Twitter's business models in a series of tweets suggesting tweaks to the platform's premium Blue service, including a cheaper subscription price, banning ads and offering the option to pay in cryptocurrency. The service, which offers users access to additional features, like an undo button and ad-free news articles, currently costs $2.99 a month. 'Price should probably be ~$2/month, but paid 12 months up front & account doesn't get checkmark for 60 days (watch for credit card chargebacks) & suspended with no refund if used for scam/spam,' Musk wrote Saturday. 'And no ads,' the South African mogul added. 'The power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if Twitter depends on advertising money to survive.' Musk also declared that 'Everyone who signs up for Twitter Blue (ie pays $3/month) should get an authentication checkmark.' Despite the fact that Twitter claims policy decisions are not determined by board members or shareholders, millions of investors flocked to Twitter's stock after Musk disclosed his 9.2 percent stake in the company. The stock became the most bought U.S. stock by retail investors on Monday, surging 27 percent in value. Stock prices rose by more than three percent, to 50.98, on Tuesday after news of Musk's board appointment. The stock was trading at around 39 on Friday. However, Wall Street analysts allege the Musk-fueled buzz around Twitter is a 'bit extreme,' given that the platform's fundamentals and challenges 'remain broadly the same'. Jeffries equity analyst Brent Thill told Fox Business[https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/investors-elon-musk-twitter-stake] the stock's gain was a 'potential overreaction given the unclear rationale behind Musk's $3.7B investment.' Bernstein analysts Mark Shmulik and Toni Sacconaghi Jr. told the news outlet they believe Musk's interest in Twitter was 'mainly personal and nothing more than a potential distraction.' 'We view the interest as a potential distraction for Musk and TSLA shareholders, given that Musk is arguably already overcommitted, and his fervor for the topic of censorship/free speech is high,' the pair reportedly wrote their clients Tuesday. 'The magnitude of the pre-market stock move speaks volumes of an investor base eager for any positive jolt, as the stock was previously around IPO levels. Some investors are certainly hoping for a sale, but we believe the stock move is likely an overreaction for this broadly speculative possibility.' Musk has developed a loyal following of investors who stuck with his company Tesla Inc for most of the past decade while it was still struggling to streamline production of electric cars and make them affordable. Tesla is now among the world's most valuable companies with a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion. Musk, who is also behind other ventures such as rocket maker SpaceX, is the world's richest person with a net worth pegged by Forbes at $290billion. The entrepreneur's popularity with retail investors was one of the reasons why Twitter agreed this week to offer him a seat on its board of directors, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Musk and Twitter did not respond to requests for comment. News of Musk's board seat came amid allegations he broke SEC rules after missing the ownership-disclosure deadline for his stake in Twitter. According to an SEC 13G filing obtained by DailyMail.com Tuesday, Musk purchased 73.5 million shares of the platform on March 14, worth about $3billion. A SEC 13G filing is reserved for passive investors. Tax experts argued the SpaceX CEO had left himself open to penalties of up to $207,183 after he failed to submit the ownership acquisition disclosure late within 10 days of acquiring 5 percent of the company, as required by U.S. securities law. Musk should have disclosed his shares by March 24 but didn't sign the filing until 21 days after his purchase. He also failed to include a certification indicating he didn't acquire his stake in Twitter to change or influence control of the company, as is typically done when filing a 13G report, The Wall Street Journal[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/elon-musks-twitter-investment-raises-new-regulatory-red-flag-11649114327] reported. Instead of including the certification in his form, Musk simply wrote: 'Not applicable'. His largest purchase occurred on February 7 when he acquired more than 4.8 million shares, worth approximately $176million.  Twitter closed at its 2022 low point on March 7 when shares were trading at $32.42 each. They had ended January at $37.51 and have significantly surged in the wake of the news surrounding Musk's involvement with the platform."
615,0,Government coronation ministers weigh the need for restaurant closure on Friday - coming into force weeks later*** TRANSLATED ***,880 words,STT,"- We hope that we will not have to do this, but unfortunately we will also have to prepare for it, Marin said. Marin also said he had talks with President Sauli NiinistÃ¶ on Thursday. According to Marin, for example, distance learning does not have to be implemented before the Emergency Preparedness Act can be invoked, although the Emergency Preparedness Act has only been identified as a last resort in the government's emergency braking mechanism. The government's coronation ministerial working group is prepared to sit down on Friday both in the morning and in the afternoon. According to preliminary data, at least the opening hours of on-premises restaurants, new corona subsidies and possibly considerations related to the stand-by law are emerging. The Department of Health and Welfare(THL) has recommended that bars and pubs be completely closed for three weeks. Even today, restaurants should close their doors in the early evening. Government sources describe the restaurant ban as a very difficult issue and it is the subject of intense debate. According to STT's information, the government has prepared new subsidies for companies affected by the restrictions. Marin has also stated that if a restaurant closure is reached, the compensation must be part of the whole. Prepare just in case The coronation ministerial working group had a short meeting as early as Thursday morning. According to government sources, the ministers received an overview of the adequacy of personnel in the security of supply sectors at that time, and the situation is not alarming. The closure of the restaurants was discussed at the meeting, but in any case, the entry into force of the closure was estimated to be weeks away, even if it was decided tomorrow. The preparation of the legislation on the embargo would take at least a couple of weeks, with rounds of opinions and parliamentary deliberations. The possible preparation for the introduction of the provisions of the Emergency Preparedness Act was reportedly not discussed on Thursday. Government sources have not yet been able to assess how close the exceptional circumstances may be. Due to the worsening corona situation, the government has also prepared for the establishment of exceptional circumstances, and preparations for the introduction of a state of emergency have begun. According to a government source, ministries have been asked to evaluate and prepare regulations for the introduction of possible contingency clauses just in case. The settings must be ready if the situation requires it. - The fact that something is being prepared does not mean that it needs to happen tomorrow or this week anyway, a government source told STT. In practice, sections of the Emergency Preparedness Act may be needed to relieve the hospital workload if, for example, there are no other arrangements for nursing staff. The area in the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District(Hus) has been particularly heavy. Exposures and illnesses among staff also complicate the situation. Section 86 of the Emergency Act, which has previously been in force, may oblige municipal or private service providers to increase the number of treatment places and to treat patients other than usual. Patients can also be transferred from one hospital to another or, for example, from the public to the private, if the capacity to treat patients is insufficient. In addition to the last and second spring, Article 88 has been used, on the basis of which it is possible to deviate from the deadlines for emergency care if it is necessary. Units can transfer nursing staff from non-emergency care to emergency care and other emergency care for coronary patients. ""Waiting mood"" in specialist care On Thursday, Liisa-Maria Voipio-Pulk, STM's leading expert, was asked in the progress report for an assessment of the need for an emergency law from the perspective of hospitals. According to him, personnel arrangements are always managed in a different way. - At the moment, the atmosphere of our special care is waiting. One could say that it is very awkward, in some places very difficult. In special care, there are better opportunities to adjust one's own activities in the short term by reducing unhurried appointment-based activities, Voipio-Pulkki replied. He added that almost all Finnish hospital districts have had to adjust the operation of non-urgent appointments and that is not a desirable situation for a long time. In addition, intensive care patients have been transported from less congested areas to less congested areas. *** DISCLAIMER: THIS IS AN AUTOMATED TRANSLATION FROM FINNISH ***"

Adil Rashid and Sam Billings were both unsold. Wood, Bairstow and Roy were all members of Englandâs 2019 World Cup-winning team and have featured in the IPL before, although Woodâs only previous experience amounted to one unsuccessful match for Chennai Super Kings in 2018. Bairstow has performed well in three seasons with Sunrisers Hyderabad, who were among those bidding to recruit him again, along with Punjab and Delhi Capitals. Jos Buttler and Moeen Ali are already assured of IPL places having been retained by Rajasthan Royals and Chennai respectively. Wood was Englandâs leading wicket-taker in the Ashes and Bairstow struck Englandâs only century. The auction was interrupted for 90 minutes after Hugh Edmeades, the English auctioneer, fainted on stage due to what was later reported to be low blood pressure. He eventually walked from the room but when the auction resumed, his place was taken by broadcaster Charu Sharma. As a result, fewer than 100 cricketers went under the hammer, meaning Eoin Morgan, Liam Livingstone and Jofra Archer, among other England players, have to wait until the second day to discover if they are to be bought."
857,0,Neil Young Demands Spotify Remove His Music -- Update,604 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"Mr. Young wasn't immediately available for comment. The letter came in response to The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which is currently Spotify's most popular podcast, and also tops Apple 's podcasting charts. In 2020, Mr. Rogan signed an exclusive podcasting deal with Spotify, reportedly worth more than $100 million. ""With an estimated 11 million listeners per episode, JRE, which is hosted exclusively on Spotify, is the world's largest podcast and has tremendous influence. Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform, though the company presently has no misinformation policy,"" Mr. Young wrote in the letter. ""I want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform...They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.""  Spotify didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Young's letter cited an episode of the podcast in which Mr. Rogan spoke with Dr. Robert Malone, a virologist who worked on research into several mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, but who is now critical of the treatments. Among the claims made was the suggestion that hospitals have been financially motivated to falsely diagnose deaths as having been caused by Covid-19. Mr. Rogan has regularly used his podcast to discuss Covid-19 vaccines and restrictions, railing against vaccine mandates for indoor events and suggesting that young, healthy people shouldn't be vaccinated.  Spotify's bet on Mr. Rogan's show has caused trouble in the past for the audiostreaming company. Some employees expressed concern over the podcast's content during a town-hall meeting in September 2020, relating to material they felt was anti-transgender, according to people familiar with the matter. Earlier this month a group of 270 scientists and healthcare professionals signed an open letter to Spotify accusing the podcast of ""promoting baseless conspiracy theories"" and asking the service to take action against mass-misinformation events on its platform. ""Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Joe Rogan has repeatedly spread misleading and false claims on his podcast, provoking distrust in science and medicine,"" it said.

780,0,Hackers Targeted News Corp's Tech Suppliers; Investigators believe hackers accessed emails and documents to aid Chinese intelligence,830 words,WSJ Pro Cybersecurity,"The company in a securities filing on Friday said it ""relies on third-party providers for certain technology and âcloud-based' systems and services that support a variety of business operations,"" and that one of these systems ""was the target of persistent cyberattack activity."" The attack came as U.S. officials over the past year have been increasingly warning of criminal and nation-state hackers breaking into the computer systems of organizations through sometimes opaque supply chains for software and other technologies. A News Corp spokesman on Friday declined to comment on its vendors or which data was stolen, citing a continuing investigation. In its email to staff, News Corp said that computer systems housing consumer and financial data weren't affected. ""In addition, we have not experienced related interruptions to our business operations,"" Chief Technology Officer David Kline and Chief Information Security Officer Billy O'Brien wrote in the email. ""Based on our investigation to date, we believe the threat activity is contained."" Messrs. Kline and O'Brien said their inquiry is in its early stages. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that hackers had access to News Corp's systems since at least February 2020, gaining access to emails and Google Docs, including drafts of articles. Beijing that year expelled U.S. journalists[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/china-bans-all-u-s-nationals-working-for-the-wall-street-journal-new-york-times-washington-post-whose-press-credentials-end-in-2020-11584464690] employed by news outlets including the Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post. Gaining access to emails and documents could give hackers snapshots of reporters' sources and plans for articles, said Runa Sandvik, a former senior director for information security at the New York Times. ""Let's say attackers get access to emails. Then, potentially, there could be communications about who is going to cover the Olympics in China,"" said Ms. Sandvik, who now consults for media organizations. ""How are they collaborating?"" News Corp said Friday it disclosed the hack to law-enforcement officials and is providing technical details of the attack to the Media and Entertainment Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a nonprofit that shares security information among the media industry. Chris Taylor, director of the ME-ISAC, declined to comment on any data News Corp shared, as companies report such information under the promise of anonymity. In most incidents analyzed by the nonprofit, hackers blast out phishing emails to countless potential targets in the hope of landing a victim, Mr. Taylor said. Attacks tailored for specific organizations ""are scarier but they are way less frequent,"" he said. ""Attackers will do more research."" Mandiant Inc., a cybersecurity company that specializes in investigating hacks, is helping News Corp respond to the incident. ""Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests,"" said David Wong, Mandiant's vice president of consulting. ""China firmly opposes and combats cyber attacks and cyber theft in all forms,"" a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said in an email. ""We hope that there can be a professional, responsible and evidence-based approach to identifying cyber-related incidents, rather than making allegations based on speculations."" The report of the breach comes days after Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray warned of Chinese-linked attempts to steal sensitive or valuable data. Speaking Tuesday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Mr. Wray highlighted last year's hack of thousands[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/china-linked-hack-hits-tens-of-thousands-of-u-s-microsoft-customers-11615007991] of U.S. companies through certain versions of Microsoft Corp.'s Exchange email client, which is used by many businesses. ""The Chinese government steals staggering volumes of information and causes deep, job-destroying damage across a range of industriesâso much so that, as you heard, we're constantly opening new cases to counter their intelligence operations, about every 12 hours or so,"" he said. The Biden administration has ordered federal agencies to more aggressively vet their vendors and has urged companies to do the same as they shore up their internal defenses. Suppliers are appealing targets because they often have poorly understood connections to other businesses, cybersecurity experts say, raising the possibility that a single hack can wreak widespread havoc. In December 2020, several federal agencies discovered that a suspected Russian espionage operation broke into their computer systems through a compromised software update from network-management firm SolarWinds Corp. Criminal hackers breached software provider Kaseya Ltd. last summer, exposing hundreds of its clients[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/kaseya-gets-tool-to-unlock-data-after-ransomware-attack-11626990619] to potential ransomware attacks.

495,0,Three dry days a year in Delhi as part of new liquor plan,669 words,Hindustan Times,"""In pursuance of the provisions of Rule 52 of Delhi Excise Rules, 2010, it is hereby ordered that - Republic Day (January 26), Independence Day (August 15) and Gandhi Jayanti (October 2) - shall be observed as ""dry day"" in the national capital by all the licensees of the excise department and vends located in Delhi for the year 2022,"" the order said. At 21, the number of dry days in the Capital was among the highest across states and Union territories. A reduction in the number was a long-standing demand of liquor store owners, and bars and restaurants, and was expected to be part of the new excise policy that came into effect on October 1. Apart from the three, the Delhi government may declare any other dry day, from time-to-time, said the order. To be sure, the order added that restrictions on the sale of liquor on dry days will not apply for residents in hotels with a valid license. HT reported on January 20 that though Delhi had a new liquor policy, two of the key promises made previously -- the lowering of the legal drinking age to 21, and a reduction in the number of dry days to 3 -- remained just that for now, promises. In a press conference on March 22 last year, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also the city's excise minister, announced that Delhi would have a new excise regime which would slash legal age of drinking to 21, and reduce the number of dry days besides introducing various reforms. Many of the changes have been implemented, and now, with the reduction in number of dry says, people expect that there could be some movement on lowering the drinking age. For this, the excise department has to issue separate order. A senior government official said on condition of anonymity that reducing the legal drinking age has the necessary approvals from all authorities concerned, but might not happen now. ""The legal age will be reduced only when the government formally notifies the change. It may be that it wants to put the matter on hold for sometime considering the political implications and the municipal elections are only a few months away,"" the official said. The BJP and the Congress have opposed the new excise regime and held several protests against the new liquor policy. Since the drinking age is lower in neighbouring cities, Delhi's high legal drinking age forces young people to travel to neighbouring cities which allows drinking at 21. Delhi is now the only metropolitan city with the high drinking age - even in Mumbai, only hard liquor is barred for those under 25, while wine and beer is allowed at 21. In major global cities such as New York and London, the drinking age is 21 and 18 respectively. Kabir Suri, the president of the National Restaurants Association of India welcomed the government's move to reduce the number of dry days. ""It will lead to increase in sale and also ensure that there is not many disruptions in supply of liquor. Additionally, the revenue of the government will also increase and the move will also check black marketing of liquor on the dry days."" Suri demanded that the government should now also reduce the legal drinking age to 21. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times."

528,0,Japan widens virus restrictions as Omicron surges in cities,612 words,BusinessLine Online,"The restraint, which is something of a pre-state of emergency, is the first since September and is scheduled to last through February 13. With three other prefectures ï¿½?Okinawa, Hiroshima and Yamaguchi ï¿½?under similar measures since early January, the state of restraint now covers 16 areas, or one-third, of the country. While many Japanese adults are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, few have gotten a booster shot, which has been a vital protection from the highly contagious omicron variant of the coronavirus. Throughout the pandemic, Japan has resisted the use of lockdowns to limit the spread of the virus and has focused on requiring eateries to close early and not serve alcohol, and on urging the public to wear masks and practice social distancing, as the government seeks to minimise damage to the economy. Under the latest measure, most eateries are asked to close by 8 pm, while large events can allow full capacity if they compile anti-virus plans. Critics say the measures, which almost exclusively target bars and restaurants, make little sense and are unfair. After more than two years of repeated restraints and social distancing requests, Japanese are increasingly becoming less co-operative to such measures. People are back to commuting on packed trains and shopping at crowded stores. Border controls Japan briefly eased border controls in November but quickly reversed them to ban most foreign entrants when the Omicron variant began spreading in other countries. Japan says it will stick to the stringent border policy through end of February as the country tries to reinforce medical systems and treatment. The tough border controls have triggered criticism from foreign students and scholars who say the measure is not scientific. Tokyo logged 8,638 new cases of coronavirus infection Thursday, exceeding the previous record of 7,377 set just the day before. At a Tokyo metropolitan government task force meeting, experts sounded alarm at the fast-paced upsurge led by Omicron. Norio Ohmagari, Director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center of National Center for Global Health and an advisor to the Tokyo metropolitan government panel, said Tokyo's daily new cases may exceed 18,000 within a week if the increase continues at the current pace. Though only some of the soaring number of infected people are hospitalised and occupying less than one-third of available hospital beds in the Japanese capital, experts say the rapid upsurge of the cases could quickly overwhelm the medical systems once the infections further spread among the elderly population who are more likely to become seriously ill. Surging infections have already begun to paralyse hospitals, schools and other sectors in some areas. The ministry has trimmed the required self-isolation period from 14 days to 10 for those who come into close contact with someone who test positive for Covid-19, and to seven days for essential workers if they test negative. While about 80 per cent of Japanese have received their first two vaccine doses, the rollout of booster shots has been slow and has reached only 1.4 per cent of the population so far. The health ministry is set to approve inoculation for children aged 5-11 who are now increasingly vulnerable.

395,1,Chinese-invested enterprises in South Africa hold job fair to pursue localized development,881 words,People's Daily Online,"Long queues of people waited to submit their CVs in front of the stands of their preferred companies. To prevent chaos, organizers had to limit admissions due to the sheer number of participants. Chinese Ambassador Chen Xiaodong said the job Fair is a concrete initiative and effort to implement agreements between the leaders of the two countries. It not only creates jobs for South Africans but also provides an opportunity for Chinese enterprises to hire local talent and pursue localized development. ""Today, over 100 Chinese-invested enterprises pledge to provide 20,000 jobs directly for South Africans in the next three years. Their businesses cover infrastructure, communications, mining, automobile, agriculture and many other areas,"" said Chen. ""For example, Huawei will provide 450 jobs and Pengxin will provide 3,500 jobs in the next three years."" South Africa's Deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Alvin Botes said the job fair showed China's commitment to eradicating the triple challenges of poverty, unemployment, and inequality and was evidence of the depth of the two countries' partnership. According to him, the job fair would not only generate much-needed jobs, but also lead to skills transfer, especially in ICT, mining clothing, information technology, and construction. ""I believe that the Chinese companies and enterprises participating in this event have already advertised job opportunities and I hope that many young South Africans would embrace these opportunities that are being offered by the Chinese business community,"" he said. Botes said there were more than 200 Chinese enterprises in South Africa in different sectors including finance, mining, home appliances, communications, and construction machinery. Chinese-invested enterprises contribute to sustainable development in South Africa as the country was one of the largest investment destinations for Chinese companies in Africa. ""China's investment in South Africa exceeded 25 billion U.S. dollars in cumulative terms,"" Botes said. ""While this Jobs Fair and the opportunities on offer should be seen as complementary to the South Africa-China strategic partnership, it could be viewed as a further opportunity to enrich the bonds of friendship and understanding that exist between our people, as well as our cultures."" South Africa's Minister of Employment and Labor Thulas Nxesi expressed his gratitude to the Chinese Embassy and Chinese businesses for hosting the Job Fair 2022 of Chinese-Invested Enterprises, which, he said, would contribute significantly to reducing unemployment in the country. ""The Jobs Fair is a milestone in our friendship that is built on trust and mutual respect. As very good friends, the Chinese government and companies are aware that the issue of employment creation is at the center of our government's programs and priorities,"" Nxesi said at the Job Fair. According to Nxesi, the unemployment rate of South Africa stands at 35.3 percent for now. This ratio is much higher when it comes to the young people that are not economically engaged. ""On behalf of our government, I wish to express our gratitude to the people of China for this important gesture which will undoubtedly contribute to our efforts to reduce the current 35.3 percent unemployment rate,"" he said while calling on Chinese companies to partner with South African companies to create jobs in the country. ""These collaborations will ensure that these companies get a chance to scale up to compete globally,"" Nxesi said. ""Moreover, we will improve our cooperation at the level of BRICS and other platforms to build labor markets that are resilient and responsive to the needs of our citizens.""

596,0,"Government begins preparations for full closure of on-premises restaurants - entry into force ""three to four weeks away""*** TRANSLATED ***",702 words,STT,"The National Institute for Health and Welfare(THL) has recommended their complete exclusion. The facility has classified bars, pubs and nightclubs as high-risk events for coronary infections. On the other hand, according to the department, food and staff restaurants are places with a low risk of infection. Minister of Economic Affairs Mika LintilÃ¤(center) announced the start of preparations on Friday. According to the minister, the government is very united that low-risk restaurants should not be subject to further restrictions. The closure would not materialize immediately. - It will probably talk about a three- to four-week timeline, because then Parliament will decide the law in due course, LintilÃ¤ said. The policy was made in the government's coroner's ministerial working group. The operation of the restaurants is already heavily regulated, as all restaurants will have to close in the evening and their customer numbers will be limited. Despite THL's recommendation, a total ban on liquor restaurants alone has been considered difficult by the government. The suspicion has been caused by the specification of restaurants in the law. The law will be prepared in co-operation between the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. The latter has wanted to close all restaurants. The completed legislative proposal is decided separately in the working group of the Minister for Coronation. The support pot could be over 200 million It was also announced at the event, among other things, that the government is preparing a closure fee and a new round of cost subsidies for companies affected by various corona operations. The closure compensation would currently apply, for example, to sports and sports facilities that have been closed by an official decision. The cost support for companies subject to less restrictive restrictions would be the sixth in a row. There is also an event guarantee under construction that would allow for the planning of summer events. At the moment, Finland could only grant the guarantee until the end of June, but according to LintilÃ¤, the government intends to apply to the European Commission for permission to extend the guarantee until the end of September. In order to finance the support measures, the government is submitting an amending budget to Parliament at the beginning of February, when the government will also submit its bill on the matter. According to LintilÃ¤, the exact size of the compensation will only be decided when the duration of the various closures and restrictions is specified. He said tentatively that the total amount of aid could be between ï¿½?200 and ï¿½?250 million. - This is very difficult to assess, because the compensation for companies, events and event organizers is compensated in proportion to how they have had events and which days the companies have been covered by the closures, LintilÃ¤ said. Also unemployment relief Exceptions to the labor market support for entrepreneurs will also be extended due to interest rate restrictions. The government is making an amendment to the Unemployment Insurance Act, according to which labor market support can be paid to an entrepreneur again, even if the entire business does not cease. Minister of Labor Tuula Haatainen(sd.) Spoke at the press conference. Labor market support can be paid from January to February. The presentation is due as soon as possible. The deductible at the beginning of unemployment will also be abolished again, said Minister of Social Affairs and Health Hanna Sarkkinen(left). Unemployment insurance normally has a deductible for the first five days, during which no daily allowance is paid. According to him, preparations have already been made and the proposal will be submitted to Parliament as soon as possible. The policy would be valid from January to February. *** DISCLAIMER: THIS IS AN AUTOMATED TRANSLATION FROM FINNISH ***"
385,0,Can China's Starbucks win back investors?,2694 words,Financial Times,"By Eleanor Olcott and Tabby Kinder I n less than five years of existence, Luckin Coffee has been variously a symbol of the dynamism of Chinese capitalism, the subject of a massive fraud scandal and now its new senior executives insist a plucky comeback story that has the potential to test US-China relations. Founded in 2017, the chain of coffee shops spread quickly across China, creating a homegrown challenger to Starbucks. Just two years later, Luckin floated on Nasdaq with a market value that reached $13bn as investors were seduced by the prospect of booming Chinese consumer demand. But the company unravelled in 2020 after it was revealed to have defrauded investors by faking more than $300mn of sales. Luckin was delisted by Nasdaq and forced to pay $180mn to settle charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The scandal stung investors such as BlackRock and GIC and provided the latest illustration of the failure of Big Four auditors to spot holes in company accounts Luckin had been audited by EY. Most of all, it became a trigger for a political controversy over the presence of Chinese companies on US capital markets. The scandal was seized upon by some US senators as a prime example of how Chinese corporates could not be trusted, part of a broader push by some in Washington to decouple the US financial system from China. But two years later, Luckin is hoping that investors, regulators and even politicians have forgotten the entire episode. The Chinese coffee chain is staging an audacious comeback that involves trying to raise new capital, meeting with investors and plotting with advisers to relist its shares in the US, according to people familiar with the matter. The company declined to comment on its proposed relisting plans, but one senior executive said it was now ""in a position where we're more comfortable re-engaging with public investors"" and that it wanted to ""regain credibility"". Luckin says it has turned a new page. ""Almost everything about Luckin apart from the name has changed over the past two years,"" says Guo Jinyi, who took over as chief executive officer in July 2020, two months after it was delisted. ""The business approach, the operation, the team, the company culture which was responsible for the financial problems have all changed."" Since the company was delisted, Luckin claims to have been on a tear in China. Revenues have more than doubled to $364.7mn year on year in the latest quarterly earnings report. Luckin now has more than 6,000 stores across China, about 500 more than Starbucks. The rapid growth story that global investors initially bought into when the company started trading in the US in 2019 appears to have been borne out. Chinese consumers have flocked to Luckin in search of cheap hits of caffeine. ""Luckin is truly a national enterprise. It goes abroad to rip off others' money and then gives coffee vouchers to people in China,"" says Wang Ning, a 29-year-old wealth manager in Beijing and regular Luckin customer. That growth is once again attracting the interest of investors. More than $20mn of its shares change hands in over-the-counter transactions every day and the company's market value has climbed back up to more than $3bn, after its shares lost 90 per cent of their value in 2020. The question is ""whether the fraud was hiding a permanently flawed business or if it was lying on top of something legitimate that had long-term viability"", says John Zolidis, president of the New York-based equity research firm Quo Vadis Capital. Zolidis says Luckin's shares are ""attractively valued given the overhang of fraud"". Luckin's attempt to relist is a big test of the efforts by some politicians in Washington to limit the presence of Chinese companies on US markets. Will the political, regulatory and legal obstacles that Chinese companies face frustrate Luckin's plans, or will they be overcome by the lure to investors of one of the world's most appealing consumer growth stories? ""Everyone expected it to sink but it instead appears to be a phoenix rising from the flames,"" says a veteran analyst of Chinese companies in Hong Kong. ""If it were to relist it would cause all sorts of political ramifications. To a degree, it would look like a political act as much as [having] accounting or investor-related repercussions."" Luckin Coffee was founded in the south-east coastal city of Xiamen by a serial entrepreneur, Charles Lu. The former chair of the coffee chain, whose name means ""lucky"" in Mandarin, expanded the company's network of stores in China at a breakneck speed. Lu brought on Qian Zhiya, a colleague from a car rental company that had experienced similarly explosive growth in its early years, to serve as Luckin's CEO. On the eve of Luckin's stock market debut in 2019, Forbes estimated that Lu's net worth was $2.3bn. 'Fundamentally broken' At the root of the Luckin fraud was its aggressive expansion strategies, favoured by Lu, of grabbing market share for new customers with heavily discounted beverages and then inflating the net selling price to hide the fact it was selling at a loss. ""The company was burning through money,"" says one Luckin insider of the period leading up to the IPO and follow-on offering. This was highlighted in a damning 89- page report first published by American short selling firm Muddy Waters in January 2020, which accused it of inflating sales, poor corporate governance and being a ""fundamentally broken"" business. An undercover research firm dispatched more than 1,000 researchers to Luckin Coffee stores to monitor customer traffic and coffee sales and found discrepancies with their reported figures. Lu and Qian, who have both since left the company, did not respond to requests for comment. Lu conceded on his public WeChat account in May 2020 that his ""style may have been too aggressive"" but added ""it was never my intention to deceive investors."" Two years on, Luckin says things have changed. A senior executive says its internal controls have been improved by hiring personnel from the Big Four accounting firms to conduct internal checks and report directly to the audit committee, which corporate governance experts say is a crucial step for any company that is planning to attract new international investors. At the centre of the coffee chain's turnround has been David Li, whose $2bn private equity fund, Centurium Capital, was one of Luckin's earliest and biggest financial backers. Centurium sold $232mn worth of shares just before the scandal but has since bought several larger stakes in Luckin at a much lower price. Last month, it became the company's controlling shareholder after it acquired shares that were previously held by Luckin's co-founders. Li has been ""cleaning up the company, getting rid of the bad guys"", says a person close to him. He ""had a team camped out at the company for months, working out a turnround strategy"". Luckin used the cash injection from Centurium to pay for shareholder litigation and repay some of the debts due on bonds and overseas restructuring costs. The company is now on the brink of ending bankruptcy proceedings in the US, a crucial step in its path to relist. As a result of the bankruptcy process, the hedge funds that bought about $420mn of its convertible bonds in January 2020 will receive about 96 cents on the dollar. ""After only one-and-a-half years, they have got almost all their money back, plus some new bonds, cash and stock,"" says an external adviser involved in the restructuring process. ""If you break it down, it is a genuinely unprecedented situation,"" says the person. ""I've never seen another case where you have such a high return for creditors, settlement of legal and regulatory matters and improving operating performance all in the same short period of 18 months."" Li and Guo's turnround strategy includes closing down underperforming stores and increasing the price of a cup of coffee by 60 per cent to an average of $2.50 still half the price of an equivalent Starbucks coffee. Luckin claims it has reduced property and staffing costs through the use of an ""in-app"" purchase system and has started using franchisees to expand the number of its stores rather than owning them all outright. It has also had success with new beverages, including a coconut velvet latte that sold out over the summer. Xu Xueqiong, 36, owner of a small business in Anqing, a city in Anhui province, is an avid fan of the drink. She says Luckin's branding, use of coupons and sweeter flavours ""suit Chinese people's consumption habits"". Michael Norris, a senior research analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina, says that Guo's gamble to start using franchisee partners to share the risk of opening new stores, especially in lower-tier cities, has paid off. Revenue from those stores has tripled in the last quarter compared with the same period the previous year. But analysts have warned that Chinese consumer habits are fickle, and Luckin is increasingly fighting competition from domestic rivals with substantial financial backing, including a new, trendier competitor, Manner Coffee. Norris adds that investors may be sceptical at reports of accelerating growth: ""Revenues rising sharply is something that those of us who have been following Luckin have seen before."" It reported a net loss of $859mn for the 2020 financial year. In the first nine months of 2021, Luckin's net losses were $3.6mn, according to its financial statements. Carson Block, founder and head of Muddy Waters, says he is ""surprised"" at Luckin's turnround: ""In the old days, companies were finished once confirmed that they were frauds ... But Luckin seems to be saying the fraud is water under the bridge. That now they've raised the money on the back of lies, they're putting it to use and becoming real,"" adds Block. Winning back trust Far harder than inventing coconut lattes will be the job of convincing foreign investors and regulators that its finances can be trusted. Luckin is setting out plans to relist at a time when tensions between the US and China over the quality of Chinese companies listed in US markets is at an all-time low. The most recent case was the disastrous listing of Didi, a ride-hail- ing app, last June, when regulatory blocks by Beijing days after its flotation meant its shares crashed by 80 per cent and investors lost billions. Since then, new flotations by Chinese companies in the US have been in effect paralysed. Both Washington and Beijing are wary of continuing to permit the deepening of financial links between Wall Street and corporate China. To relist on the Nasdaq centralised exchange Luckin needs to first formally exit bankruptcy proceedings, which according to an individual involved in the process should happen in the next few weeks. Luckin will then apply to rejoin Nasdaq's centralised exchange. The exchange can deny a company's listing if it believes investors might be at risk, but in general, it is required to accept those companies that meet the exchange's requirements. The SEC and Nasdaq refused to comment on Luckin's relisting plans. The company will also need to navigate new laws that have come into place in the wake of its 2020 scandal which make the US a far less hospitable environment for Chinese companies going public. The US Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which was passed in late 2020, puts pressure on Chinese companies to make audit papers available for inspection. It could force about 240 Chinese companies worth a combined $2tn to delist from US exchanges over the next few years. ""There is no indication that either the US or China will budge on this issue,"" says Jay Ritter, an IPO expert at the University of Florida. Under this law, the US authorities could delist companies that fail to submit to US regulatory checks on their audits for three years in a row. This has resulted in a stalemate for companies and their accountants as Beijing does not permit foreign oversight of Chinese companies' financial records. As a result, even if it successfully relists, Luckin could be delisted again by US regulators in the future purely because of a lack of access to its audit files. ""If Luckin relists and is trading, what's the price discount for the fact that if you buy the shares you don't know if or where you're going to be able to sell them in two or three years' time?"" says one accounting expert. Crucial to Luckin's comeback will be investors' confidence that its books are credible, especially given the failures of original auditors EY to identify duplicity, and perhaps also the fact that the CFO at the time of the scandal, Reinout Schakel, is still in place. Since the fraud was exposed, Luckin has had two new audit firms. The group appointed Hong Kong accounting firm Centurion ZD CPA as its auditor in April 2021 after its predecessor, New York-based Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk, was replaced. As US regulators and exchanges put greater focus on the quality of Chinese company audits, the work of a smaller firm is likely to receive more scrutiny. Centurion, which says it has about 40 accountants in Hong Kong and the US, is registered with the US audit regulator, allowing it to sign off the accounts of Chinese companies listed in America. But so far it audits just a small number of such companies traded on Nasdaq or over the counter. Centurion did not respond to a request for comment. In its audit of Luckin's 2020 accounts, the most recent full-year audited financial statements, Centurion identified as a ""material weakness"" that Luckin lacked ""entity level control policies and procedures, including failure to demonstrate commitment to integrity and ethical values"". It also said Luckin lacked appropriate separation of duties, including around making investment decisions and use of funds. Even so, some investors may be tempted back into its equity because of Luckin's growth prospects. ""By market capitalisation per store, it is a cheap and attractive asset,"" says a fund manager who has traded Luckin's over-the-counter shares. Yet so far, it is primarily China-focused hedge funds and mainland capital that have flooded back into Luckin shares. ""It's hard to see someone like Fidelity getting back into it on day one,"" the fund manager adds. Winning back the support of large international investors would be critical for Luckin's comeback story. ""I suspect there is work to be done for redemption before that,"" says Kerrie Waring, chief executive of the International Corporate Governance Network, a lobby group for institutional investors. As investors question whether they can trust Luckin, one former US regulator says the fact that the company is under such intense scrutiny means it may be less likely to repeat past crimes. ""Sometimes thesafest place to eat is a place that's just reopened after the health department shut them down.""

""I'm trying to find more entry points into serious material [that] spark joy within myself, because times do seem so dark,"" Bee says over the phone. ""The subject matter of this shoot is very heavy, but the entryway is kittens, which are especially effective for luring people in. And so I have decided that I need to speak of this very serious material with kittens all over my shoulders and I can't wait."" It speaks to the Toronto native's ethos that humour is always the cure, particularly at a time when the world has never been more fraught, between a pandemic and a racial awakening. It's the lens through which ""Full Frontal"" has operated for seven seasons, along with Bee's interview podcast, ""Full Release,"" which explores how to navigate and find laughter in a shifting world. As part of its second season, Bee is set to remotely host a live episode at the Hot Docs Podcast Festival on Friday. The festival launches Tuesday, and also features conversations with Ira Glass, Michael Lewis, Anna Maria Tremonti, and more. The podcastpremiered in July 2020, and while it proved to be the perfect pandemic vocation as a solely audio format, Bee had been plotting one for several years. With guests ranging from Canadian gynecologist Jen Gunter to writer Roxane Gay and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, ""Full Release"" offers a space for Bee to focus on a single subject, for up to an hour. ""The show itself is editorial and the podcast is a conversation,"" says Bee. ""It's me being led by my own curiosity and getting a full portrait of a person, hearing their story and understanding where they're coming from. ""I'm not setting an agenda [here]. It's freeform and nice to be able to go off in a direction you don't see coming, which I basically do with everybody, because people will always take you on a journey that you weren't completely expecting."" It also means she's finally getting to spend time with people she actually likes. Because if you know ""Full Frontal,"" then you're well aware that Bee is often speaking to or taking down controversial politicians and policies, from Ted Cruz to Jeb Bush, through a distinctlyfeminist position. As Bee describes it, her objective on ""Full Frontal"" has always been ""to press the gas pedal and go,"" knowing time is limited and there are ""boxes to be checked.""It's made her a polarizing figure on the left and the right, earning her a label she says she personally enjoys: ""the queen of confrontation."" While Bee says it's getting harder to book guests who don't share her views, she also says she simply doesn't care what anyone else thinks ï¿½?otherwise she'd never get the job done. ""I find it so damaging to care about how something's going to be received,"" she says. ""So I really try hard to push that out of my brain. I don't think that you can make a comedy show like this by crowdsourcing. ""This is a very Canadian approach probably, but I'm not really interested in believing someone else's hyped-up version of me, either. I'd rather just be true to myself."" In 2022, that means asking questions and connecting with leaders to find some form of instruction that might make the world feel a little more manageable. ""It offers me hope, I'm very selfish in my creative endeavors,"" says Bee, with a chuckle. ""I'm personally seeking catharsis, community and respite. I'm not coming from a place of having all the answers or being so confident in my own opinions, I actually go into it as a blank slate, ready for anything. ""Like everyone else, I need help in my life, I need somebody to tell me what to do. So it's very helpful to talk to people who have expertise in [their] fields or are just flat-out funny and great."" Her hope is to bring that salvation to Toronto later this month. While the show will be virtual due to COVID-19 restrictions, Bee promises a ""very fun, really cool"" live episode, which will feature a surprise special guest bound to lead to plenty of meaty discussion, with more than a few laughs. Humour, after all, ""is the only tool in my toolbox,"" says Bee. ""I'm always seeking a way to find some lightness, like when you watch an overly despairing film ï¿½?you need occasional moments of lightness within that overall structure. You need a breather, to look around, to get a snack and come back. ""We all need breathers right now in order to keep our energy going, otherwise you just slowly burn out. So that's what I'm trying to provide ï¿½?to myself, and others.""

872,0,"India bans 35 Pakistan-based YouTube channels, two websites",359 words,The Express Tribune,"The YouTube channels, websites, and other social media accounts blocked by the ministry were used by Pakistan for spreading anti-India fake news about sensitive subjects related to India,' it said. It was observed that these YouTube channels had also started posting content to undermine the democratic process of the upcoming elections in five states, the statement said. The statement further said that some of the YouTube channels were being operated by anchors of Pakistani TV news channels. It may be mentioned that New Delhi has been caught red-handed spreading 'fake news' and misinformation against Islamabad lately. In 2020, an independent non-profit organisation focused on tackling sophisticated disinformation had exposed the latest iteration of an Indian influence campaign aimed at defaming Pakistan within the EU institutions. According to an investigation by the EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based NGO, a coordinated influence operation, to malign Pakistan's reputation, was being led by the New-Delhi-based Srivastava Group and amplified by Asia News International (ANI), an Indian news agency. The operation's mission was to discredit nations in conflict with India in the region, in particular Pakistan and also China to a certain extent. In the long run, the campaign was aimed at bolstering India's global perception, which would ultimately allow New Delhi to bag more support from international institutions such as the EU and the UN. In August last year, a sustained disinformation and propaganda campaign by India and previous Afghan administration to sabotage the Afghan peace process and target Pakistan, was uncovered, showing the extent of the fifth-generation warfare. National Security Adviser (NSA) Moeed Yusuf had revealed that many Indian and Afghan social media accounts were involved in maligning Pakistan."
393,1,OHouse operator Bucketplace adds Softbank as pre-IPO investor in latest fundraising,454 words,Maeil Business Newspaper,"The state lender is leading the fund-raising and SoftBank Ventures has confirmed commitment, said an unnamed industry official. Existing shareholders are adding investment. Once investment is complete, the corporate value of Bucketplace is expected to reach 1.8 trillion won, more than doubled from 800 billion won during the last fundraising in 2020. Bucketplace ï¿½?founded in 2013 ï¿½?operates home design platform OHouse. The platform has strong influence on home design and living sector. It started out as an interior content community but grew as a platform where users and experts share home design photos. OHouse has 17 million contents and 11 million monthly visitors. It also sells home furniture and others and arranges trade and services for home design. The company launched its own delivery service after securing a distribution center in Icheon, Gyeonggi Province. OHouse is expanding presence not only in home design sector but all areas related to home and living. Its monthly gross merchandise value amounts to 180 billion won and cumulative merchandise value 1.7 trillion won last year, which can be comparable to Koreaâs major online fashion platform Musinsa (2.3 trillion won) and fresh food delivery platform operator Kurly (2.1 trillion won). Musinsa and Kurly are valued at each 4 trillion won and 3.8 trillion won, suggesting Bucketplace has room to grow by another 2 trillion won in valuation. Investors also have confidence in Bucketplaceâs growth blueprint. OHouse plans to expand presence in home and living service sector and advance into overseas markets like Indonesia and Japan. Bucketplace has acquired five companies as part of expansion. The company has over 150 billion won in cashable assets, which is enough to expand further through merger and acquisitions. OHouse was able to accelerate growth on surging demand for home design and interior service as companies implement 52-hour workweek and people work from home due to Covid-19, said an unnamed industry official. Its operator Bucketplace expects its first profit this year and ready itself for an initial public offering.  Click here to view image[https://file2.mk.co.kr/neds/20220415/20220415_1958024.jpg]"

Also, Somaiya stated that the company is at a ""development stage"" for manufacturing second-generation ethanol and energy cane. Additionally, the company is also working much more on research. ""We have done a lot of work on 2nd, 3rd (generation) ethanol. We think the time for that will come (for the 2nd generation of ethanol). We know how to do it and gaps that need to be filled.

448,0,Wolseley owner fights shareholder to save restaurant,950 words,Financial Times,"On a dull January Saturday, before England relaxed Covid restrictions, the Wolseley restaurant on London's Piccadilly was so packed with clients slurping pre-lunch oysters that there was only standing room at the bar. It did not look like a business on the brink of insolvency. But this week Corbin & King, which owns the Wolseley and eight other restaurants, was plunged into administration by its majority shareholder, the Thai hotel group, Minor, which said the business faced ""major liquidity constraints"" and required ""strong financial support"". The announcement triggered panicked phone calls from guests with reservations fearing the Wolseley would be shut for good. Minor was clear the restaurants would continue to operate as normal. But its move is the latest sign of a bitter battle for control of a group of restaurants that count the chef Nigella Lawson and fashion designer Paul Smith among a roster of glitzy clientele. Joan Collins once declared the Wolseley's Souffle Suisse the best meal she had had in London. Minor, which took a 74 per cent stake in Corbin & King in 2017, wanted to cut costs during the pandemic and expand the Wolseley brand worldwide. Jeremy King, founder and chief executive of Corbin & King, wants to retain control of the company he started and focus on a small number of openings in London and one in New York. The battle has come to a head over Corbin & King's default on Â£33m of loans owed to Minor, a hospitality group that operates around 2,300 restaurants in Asia and 520 hotels worldwide. ""In a decent investor situation, if they just rolled on the [loan] and let us build the company we would not be insolvent,"" King said. He took to YouTube this week to tell customers the company was ""under siege"" from its investor but the restaurants were in ""rude health"". He told the Financial Times that trading had been volatile but the company's earnings in the past seven months were higher relative to the same period prepandemic. Minor said it would not be ""drawn into a war of words"" and that its ""principal objective has been, and will always be, the commercial success of its businesses"". Like all central London restaurants, the Wolseley, situated in a highceilinged former car showroom by the Ritz, has suffered during Covid. Footfall in the city's centre is only gradually recovering after the government's workfrom-home guidance ended this week. Corbin & King's venues, which also include the Delaunay on the Strand and Colbert on Sloane Square, have been closed or trading under restrictions for most of the past 22 months. King, who ran renowned London dining rooms including Langan's Brasserie and The Ivy before starting Corbin & King with business partner Chris Corbin in 2003, has been outspoken against many Covid measures. In one email to customers he called the tier system announced in October 2020 ""another knee jerk, ineffective, window-dressing, butt-covering initiative that hasn't been thought through properly"". In 2020, the group's like-for-like sales fell 58 per cent, according to its most recent filed accounts. Its pre-tax losses widened from Â£4.9m in 2019 to Â£10.3m, while turnover almost halved to Â£22m. It has not been an easy pandemic for Minor either. In 2018, it acquired the Spanish hotel group, NH Hotels, for ï¿½?.3bn ? an ambitious bet that expanded its previously Asia-focused portfolio by around 380 hotels, most of which were leased rather than freehold. When the pandemic set in, NH had to take on more debt to meet its lease obligations. Despite reducing expenses, in the first quarter of 2021 it averaged ï¿½?9m in monthly losses. The chief executive of another international hotel group described Minor's chair Bill Heinecke as ""a growth-oriented businessman"" adding that the ""NH Hotel journey has been the most difficult [transaction for them]"". Minor denied NH Hotels had strained its finances and said, ""we continue to invest in our businesses"". When Minor bought its stake in Corbin & King, part of its Â£58m investment was a Â£20m loan note due in 2024. The hotel company also took on a Â£13.25m loan Corbin & King could not repay when it came due in May 2020 ? during the UK's first Covid lockdown. Minor initially reassured King and the company's auditors that it would not call on the bank loan, King said, but later did, in turn triggering the Â£20m loan note for repayment too. It has also trademarked some of Corbin & King's brands in Singapore against King's wishes, according to two people close to King, all while its offers to recapitalise the company came with strings attached that involved King giving up some control. Minor said ""there is great scope for expansion into key international markets"" and that it had proposed that King retain ""customer-facing aspects"" of the business. It is now for the administrators at FRP Advisory to oversee the restaurant group's future. As principal creditor, Minor has the upper hand but could face having to pay more than the value of the debt to retain control of the company if there is competition to buy it. Nick Jones, chief executive of Soho House, and a regular at Corbin & King's restaurants, said there would be ""a queue"" of interested parties ""but it would have to have Jeremy.""

751,0,"How China's TikTok, Facebook influencers push propaganda",2696 words,Associated Press Newswires,"But that lens may be controlled by CGTN, the Chinese-state run TV network where she has regularly appeared in broadcasts and is listed as a digital reporter on the company's website. And while Vica Li tells her followers that she âcreated all of these channels on her own,ï¿½?her Facebook account shows that at least nine people manage her page. That portfolio of accounts is just one tentacle of Chinaâs rapidly growing influence on U.S.-owned social media platforms, an Associated Press examination has found. As China continues to assert its economic might, it is using the global social media ecosystem to expand its already formidable influence. The country has quietly built a network of social media personalities who parrot the governmentâs perspective in posts seen by hundreds of thousands of people, operating in virtual lockstep as they promote Chinaâs virtues, deflect international criticism of its human rights abuses and advance Beijingâs talking points on world affairs like Russiaâs war against Ukraine. Some of China's state-affiliated reporters have posited themselves as trendy Instagram influencers or bloggers. The country has also hired firms to recruit influencers to deliver carefully crafted messages that boost its image to social media users. And it is benefitting from a cadre of Westerners who have devoted YouTube channels and Twitter feeds to echoing pro-China narratives on everything from Beijingâs treatment of Uyghur Muslims [https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-lifestyle-china-health-travel-7a6967f335f97ca868cc618ea84b98b9] to Olympian Eileen Gu, an American who competed for China [https://apnews.com/article/winter-olympics-Eileen-Gu-navigating-two-cultures-7536da11aec15dfcd34a949e017a6328] in the most recent Winter Games. The influencer network allows Beijing to easily proffer propaganda to unsuspecting Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube users around the globe. At least 200 influencers with connections to the Chinese government or its state media are operating in 38 different languages, according to research [https://miburo.substack.com/p/csm-influencer-ops-1?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjozOTE1NzQ5MCwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDc5MjczNjIsIl8iOiJXc0xsVCIsImlhdCI6MTY0NDM1ODU4OSwiZXhwIjoxNjQ0MzYyMTg5LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItNTQ2NDM3Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.v5RqvhQJaDzH0kbOElXikJ_aaHsjlFtgZpZSdOEyIrM&s=r] from Miburo, a firm that tracks foreign disinformation operations. âYou can see how theyâre trying to infiltrate every one of these countries,ï¿½?said Miburo President Clint Watts, a former FBI agent. âIt is just about volume, ultimately. If you just bombard an audience for long enough with the same narratives people will tend to believe them over time.ï¿½?____ While Russiaâs war on Ukraine was being broadly condemned [https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-technology-business-united-states-2580bdb50fd1b2b9021f16747128e604] as a brazen assault on democracy, self-described âtraveler,ï¿½?âstory-tellerï¿½?and ""journalistï¿½?Li Jingjing took to YouTube to offer a different narrative. She posted a video to her account called âUkraine crisis: The West ignores wars & destructions it brings to Middle East,ï¿½?in which she mocked U.S. journalists covering the war. She's also dedicated other videos to amplifying Russian propaganda [https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskyy-kyiv-technology-misinformation-5e884b85f8dbb54d16f5f10d105fe850] about the conflict, including claims of Ukrainian genocide or that the U.S. and NATO provoked Russiaâs invasion. Li Jingjing says in her YouTube profile that she is eager to show her roughly 21,000 subscribers âthe world through my lens.ï¿½?But what she does not say in her segments on Ukraine, which have tens of thousands of views, is that she is a reporter for CGTN, articulating views that are not just her own but also familiar Chinese government talking points. Most of Chinaâs influencers use pitches similar to Li Jingjingâs in hopes of attracting audiences around the world, including the U.S., Egypt and Kenya. The personalities, many of them women, call themselves âtravelers,ï¿½?sharing photos and videos that promote China as an idyllic destination. âThey clearly have identified the âChinese lady influencerï¿½?is the way to go,ï¿½?Watts said of China. The AP identified dozens of these accounts, which collectively have amassed more than 10 million followers and subscribers. Many of the profiles belong to Chinese state media reporters who have in recent months transformed their Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube accounts ï¿½?platforms that are largely blocked in China ï¿½?and begun identifying as âbloggers,ï¿½?âinfluencersï¿½?or non-descript âjournalists.ï¿½?Nearly all of them were running Facebook ads, targeted to users outside of China, that encourage people to follow their pages. The personalities do not proactively disclose their ties to Chinaâs government and have largely phased out references in their posts to their employers, which include CGTN, China Radio International and Xinhua News Agency. Foreign governments have long tried to exploit social media, as well as its ad system, to influence users. During the 2016 U.S. election, for example, a Russian internet agency paid in rubles to run more than 3,000 divisive political ads targeting Americans. [https://apnews.com/article/north-america-donald-trump-ap-top-news-hillary-clinton-politics-343e66b94d614227a29ecc1f8ba8b848]  In response, tech companies like Facebook and Twitter promised to better alert American users to foreign propaganda by labeling state-backed media accounts. But the AP found in its review that most of the Chinese influencer social media accounts are inconsistently labeled as state-funded media. The accounts ï¿½?like those belonging to Li Jingjing and Vica Li ï¿½?are often labeled on Facebook or Instagram, but are not flagged on YouTube or TikTok. Vica Liâs account is not labeled on Twitter. Last month, Twitter began identifying Li Jingjingâs account as Chinese state-media. Vica Li said in a YouTube video that she is disputing the labels on her Facebook and Instagram accounts. She did not respond to a detailed list of questions from the AP. Often, followers who are lured in by accounts featuring scenic images of China's landscape might not be aware that theyâll also encounter state-endorsed propaganda. Jessica Zangâs picturesque Instagram photos show her smiling beneath a beaming sun, kicking fresh powdered snow atop a ski resort on the Altai Mountains in China's Xinjiang region during the Beijing Olympics. She describes herself as a video creator and blogger who hopes to present her followers with âbeautiful pics and videos about life in China.ï¿½?Zang, a video blogger for CGTN, rarely mentions her employer to her 1.3 million followers on Facebook. Facebook and Instagram identify her account as âstate-controlled mediaï¿½?but she is not labeled as such on TikTok, YouTube or on Twitter, where Zang lists herself as a âsocial media influencer.ï¿½?âI think itâs likely by choice that she doesnât put any state affiliations, because you put that label on your account, people start asking certain types of questions,ï¿½?Rui Zhong, who researches technology and the China-U.S. relationship for the Washington-based Wilson Center, said of Zang. Peppered between tourism photos are posts with more obvious propaganda. One video titled âWhat foreigners in BEIJING think of the CPC and their life in China?"" features Zang interviewing foreigners in China who gush about the Chinese Communist Party and insist they're not surveilled by the government the way outsiders might think. âWe really want to let more people ... know what China is really like,ï¿½?Zang tells viewers. That's an important goal in China, which has launched coordinated efforts [https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-international-news-asia-berlin-virus-outbreak-11356a590ecee0572545b3ffb7de0d5b] to shape its image abroad and whose president, Xi Jinping, has spoken openly of his desire to have China perceived favorably on the global stage. Ultimately, accounts like Zang's are intended to obscure global criticisms of China, said Jessica Brandt, a Brookings Institution expert on foreign interference and disinformation. âThey want to promote a positive vision of China to drown out their human rights records,ï¿½?Brandt said. Li Jingjing and Zang did not return messages from the AP seeking comment. CGTN did not respond to repeated interview requests. CGTN America, which is registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department and has disclosed having commercial arrangements with several international news organizations, including the AP, CNN and Reuters, did not return messages. A lawyer who has represented CGTN America did not respond either. A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, said in a statement, âChinese media and journalists carry out normal activities independently, and should not be assumed to be led or interfered by the Chinese government.ï¿½?Chinaâs interest in the influencer realm became more evident in December after it was revealed that the Chinese Consulate in New York had paid $300,000 for New Jersey firm Vippi Media to recruit influencers to post messages to Instagram and TikTok followers during the Beijing Olympics, including content that would highlight China's work on climate change. Itâs unclear what the public saw from that campaign, and if the social media posts were properly labeled as paid advertisements by the Chinese Consulate, as Instagram and TikTok require. Vippi Media has not provided the Justice Department, which regulates foreign influence campaigns through a 1938 statute known as the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a copy of the posts it paid influencers to disseminate, even though federal law requires the company to do so. Vipp Jaswal, Vippi Mediaâs CEO, declined to share details about the posts with the AP. In other cases, the money and motives behind these Facebook posts, YouTube videos and podcasts are so murky that even those who create them say they werenât aware the Chinese government was financing the project. Chicago radio host John St. Augustine told the AP that a friend who owns New World Radio in Falls Church, Virginia, invited him to host a podcast called âThe Bridgeï¿½?with a team in Beijing. The hosts discussed daily life and music in the U.S. and China, inviting music industry workers as guests. He says he didnât know CGTN had paid New World Radio $389,000 to produce the podcast. The station was also paid millions of dollars to broadcast CGTN content 12 hours daily, according to documents filed with the Justice Department on behalf of the radio company. âHow they did all that, I had no clue,ï¿½?St. Augustine said. âI was paid by a company here in the United States.ï¿½?The stationâs relationship with CGTN ended in December, said New World Radio co-owner Patricia Lane. The Justice Department recently requested public input on how it should update the FARA statute to account for the ephemeral world of social media and its transparency challenges. âItâs not leaflets and hard copy newspapers anymore,ï¿½?FARA unit chief Jennifer Kennedy Gellie said of messaging. Itâs âtweets and Facebook posts and Instagram images.ï¿½?___ A growing chorus of English-speaking influencers has also cultivated an online niche by promoting pro-Chinese messaging in YouTube videos or tweets. Last April, as CGTN sought to expand its network of influencers, it invited English speakers to join a months-long competition that would end with jobs working as social media influencers in London, Nairobi, Kenya or Washington. Thousands applied, CGTN said in September, describing the event as a âwindow for young people around the world to understand China.ï¿½?British video blogger Jason Lightfoot raved about the opportunity in a video on YouTube advertising the event. âSo many crazy experiences that Iâll never forget for the rest of my life, and thatâs all thanks to CGTN,ï¿½?Lightfoot said in a video he said was filmed from China tech company Huaweiâs campus. Lightfoot, who did not respond to requests for comment, does not disclose this relationship with CGTN on his YouTube profile, where he has accrued millions of views with headlines like âThe Olympics Backfired on USA ï¿½?Disastrous Regretï¿½?and âWestern Media Lies about China.ï¿½?The video topics are often in sync with those of other pro-China bloggers such as Cyrus Janssen, a U.S. citizen living in Canada. During the Olympics, Janssen and Lightfoot both shared videos celebrating Guâs three-medal win, using identical images of the Olympian, though Lightfoot also poked fun at President Joe Biden. âUSAâs boycott failure ... Eileen Gu Wins Gold!ï¿½?Lightfoot posted on Feb. 10. That same day, Janssen uploaded a video titled âIs Eileen Gu a Traitor to America? American Expat Shares the Truth.ï¿½?In emails to the AP, Janssen said his videos are intended to educate people about China and said heâs never accepted money from the Chinese government. But when pressed for details about some of his partnerships, which include Chinese tech firms, Janssen responded only with questions about an APâs reporter salary. The AP also found videos that show him appearing on CGTN broadcasts. The Western influencers routinely decry what they see as distorted American media coverage of Beijing and life there. Some posts, for instance, have ridiculed Western concerns over the safety of Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai, who disappeared from view [https://apnews.com/article/peng-shuai-controlled-interview-olympics-36722c749b176f228a1db8f39678cc2f] after leveling sexual assault allegations against a former high-ranking member of Chinaâs ruling Communist Party. She resurfaced around the Olympics in a controlled interview in which she vigorously denied wrongdoing by Chinese officials and said her initial allegations had created an ""enormous misunderstanding.ï¿½?Her abrupt about-face prompted skeptical reactions in the West, which YouTuber Andy Boreham mocked in a video in which he invoked language reminiscent of the MeToo movement. âI wonder what happened to #BelieveAllWomen,"" he said. Boreham is a New Zealander and columnist for Shanghai Daily. Twitter recently labeled his account as Chinese-state affiliated media. His YouTube account remains unlabeled. In a statement, YouTube said it only applies state-affiliated media labels to organizations, not individuals who work for or with state-funded media. In a YouTube post last year, Lightfoot, who has more than 200,000 subscribers, marveled at video footage of what he said were âclean, modern, peaceful, pleasantï¿½?streets of China. The post then cut to video of gritty, trash-strewn streets he said were in Philadelphia. âWhen I first saw this video,ï¿½?he says by way of narration, âI actually thought it was from a movie. I thought it was from a zombie movie or some kind of end-of-the-world movie. But itâs not. This is real. This is America.ï¿½?YouTubers Matthew Tye, an American, and Winston Sterzel, who is from South Africa, believe that, in many cases, Chinaâs paying for videos to be created. Their evidence? The pair was included last year on an email pitch to numerous YouTube influencers from a company that identified itself as Hong Kong Pear Technology. The email asked the influencers to share a promotional video for Chinaâs Hainan province, a tourist beach destination, on their channels. Tye and Sterzel, who spent years living in China and became vocal critics of its government, assume they were probably included on the pitch by mistake. But, intrigued, they engaged in a back-and-forth with the company while feigning interest in the offer. The company representative soon followed up with a new request ï¿½?that they post a propaganda video that claimed COVID-19 did not originate in China, where the first case was detected, but rather from North American white-tailed deer. âWe could offer $2000 (totally negotiable considering the nature of this type of content) lemme know if u are interested,ï¿½?an employee named Joey wrote, according to emails shared with the AP. After Tye and Sterzel asked for articles that would back up the false claim, the emails stopped. In an email to the AP, a Pear Technology employee confirmed he had contacted Tye and Sterzel, but said he did not know much about the client, adding âit might be from the government??ï¿½?Tye and Sterzel say the exchange pulls back the curtain on how China pushes propaganda through influencers who profit from it. âThereâs a very easy formula to become successful,ï¿½?Sterzel said in an interview. âItâs simply to praise the Chinese government, to praise China and talk about how great China is and how bad the West is.ï¿½?___ Catalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey."

Announcing the closure of all McDonaldâs sites last week, the companyâs president and CEO, Chris Kempczinski , said: âThe conflict in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis in Europe has caused unspeakable suffering to innocent people.ï¿½?He added that the companyâs âvalues mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraineï¿½?  McDonaldâs will continue to pay full salaries for all Ukrainian and Russian staff. But the move has left many Russians hungry for their favourite food stores while others have capitalised on the shortages by selling regular McDonalds meals online for hundreds of pounds. In response to the announced closures, customers turned to Avito, a Russian auction site similar to eBay . One meal, consisting of two burgers, two drinks and a cherry pie was listed, with the seller asking for 7,500 Russian rubles, equivalent to Â£47 (as of 3pm on last Wednesday). Other companies to pull out of Russia include Cadbury and British tea brand, Yorkshire Tea, as well as Starbucks , Kelloggs, Kraft Heinz and PepsiCo . Heineken, the Dutch beer company, also announced it would halt the production, advertising and sale of its beer in Russia.",
391,0,Luckin Coffee: can Chinaâs Starbucks win back investors?,2730 words,Financial Times (FT.Com),"Founded in 2017, the chain of coffee shops spread quickly across China, creating a homegrown challenger to Starbucks. Just two years later, Luckin floated on Nasdaq with a market value that reached $13bn as investors were seduced by the prospect of booming Chinese consumer demand. But the company unravelled in 2020 after it was revealed to have defrauded investors by faking more than $300mn of sales. Luckin was delisted by Nasdaq and forced to pay $180mn to settle charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The scandal stung investors such as BlackRock and GIC and provided the latest illustration of the failure of Big Four auditors to spot holes in company accounts ï¿½?Luckin had been audited by EY. Most of all, it became a trigger for a political controversy over the presence of Chinese companies on US capital markets. The scandal was seized upon by some US senators as a prime example of how Chinese corporates could not be trusted, part of a broader push by some in Washington to decouple the US financial system from China. But two years later, Luckin is hoping that investors, regulators and even politicians have forgotten the entire episode. The Chinese coffee chain is staging an audacious comeback that involves trying to raise new capital, meeting with investors and plotting with advisers to relist its shares in the US, according to people familiar with the matter. The company declined to comment on its proposed relisting plans, but one senior executive said it was now âin a position where weâre more comfortable re-engaging with public investorsï¿½?and that it wanted to âregain credibilityï¿½? Luckin says it has turned a new page. âAlmost everything about Luckin ï¿½?apart from the name ï¿½?has changed over the past two years,ï¿½?says Guo Jinyi, who took over as chief executive officer in July 2020, two months after it was delisted. âThe business approach, the operation, the team, the company culture ï¿½?which was responsible for the financial problems ï¿½?have all changed.ï¿½?Since the company was delisted, Luckin claims to have been on a tear in China. Revenues have more than doubled to $364.7mn year on year in the latest quarterly earnings report. Luckin now has more than 6,000 stores across China, about 500 more than Starbucks. The rapid growth story that global investors initially bought into when the company started trading in the US in 2019 appears to have been borne out. Chinese consumers have flocked to Luckin in search of cheap hits of caffeine. âLuckin is truly a national enterprise. It goes abroad to rip off othersï¿½?money and then gives coffee vouchers to people in China,ï¿½?says Wang Ning, a 29-year-old wealth manager in Beijing and regular Luckin customer. That growth is once again attracting the interest of investors. More than $20mn of its shares change hands in over-the-counter transactions every day, and the companyâs market value has climbed back up to more than $3bn, after its shares lost 90 per cent of their value in 2020. The question is âwhether the fraud was hiding a permanently flawed business, or if it was lying on top of something legitimate that had long-term viabilityï¿½? says John Zolidis, president of the New York-based equity research firm Quo Vadis Capital. Zolidis says Luckinâs shares are âattractively valued given the overhang of fraudï¿½? Luckinâs attempt to relist is a big test of the efforts by some politicians in Washington to limit the presence of Chinese companies on US markets. Will the political, regulatory and legal obstacles that Chinese companies now face frustrate Luckinâs plans, or will they be overcome by the lure to investors of one of the worldâs most appealing consumer growth stories? Â âEveryone expected it to sink but it instead appears to be a phoenix rising from the flames,ï¿½?says a veteran analyst of Chinese companies in Hong Kong. âIf it were to relist it would cause all sorts of political ramifications. To a degree, it would look like a political act as much as [having] accounting or investor-related repercussions.ï¿½?Breakneck speed  Luckin Coffee was founded in the south-east coastal city of Xiamen by a serial entrepreneur, Charles Lu. The former chair of the coffee chain, whose name means âluckyï¿½?in Mandarin, expanded the companyâs network of stores in China at a breakneck speed. Lu brought on Qian Zhiya, a colleague from a car rental company that had experienced similarly explosive growth in its early years, to serve as Luckinâs CEO. On the eve of Luckinâs stock market debut in 2019, Forbes estimated that Luâs net worth was $2.3bn. At the root of the Luckin fraud was its aggressive expansion strategies, favoured by Lu, of grabbing market share for new customers with heavily discounted beverages and then inflating the net selling price to hide the fact it was selling at a loss. âThe company was burning through money,ï¿½?says one Luckin insider of the period leading up to the IPO and follow-on offering. This was highlighted in a damning 89-page report first published by American short selling firm Muddy Waters in January 2020, which accused it of inflating sales, having poor corporate governance and being a âfundamentally brokenï¿½?business. An undercover research firm dispatched more than 1,000 researchers to Luckin Coffee stores to monitor customer traffic and coffee sales and found discrepancies with their reported figures. Lu and Qian, who have both since left the company, did not respond to requests for comment. Lu posted on his public WeChat account in May 2020: âMy style may have been too aggressive and the company may have grown too fast, which led to many problems. But it was never my intention to deceive investors.ï¿½?Two years on, Luckin says things have changed. A senior executive says its internal controls have been improved by hiring personnel from the Big Four accounting firms to conduct internal checks and report directly to the audit committee, which corporate governance experts say is a crucial step for any company that is planning to attract new international investors. At the centre of the coffee chainâs turnround has been David Li, whose $2bn private equity fund, Centurium Capital, was one of Luckinâs earliest and biggest financial backers. Centurium sold $232mn worth of shares just before the scandal but has since bought several larger stakes in Luckin at a much lower price. Last month, it became the companyâs controlling shareholder after it acquired shares that were previously held by Luckinâs co-founders. Li has been âcleaning up the company, getting rid of the bad guysï¿½? says a person close to him. He âhad a team camped out at the company for months, working out a turnround strategyï¿½? the person adds. Luckin used the cash injection from Centurium to pay for shareholder litigation and repay some of the debts due on bonds and overseas restructuring costs. The company is now on the brink of ending bankruptcy proceedings in the US, a crucial step in its path to relist. As a result of the bankruptcy process, the hedge funds that bought about $420mn of its convertible bonds in January 2020 will receive about 96 cents on the dollar. âAfter only one-and-a-half years, they have got almost all their money back, plus some new bonds, cash and stock,ï¿½?says an external adviser involved in the restructuring process. âIf you break it down, it is a genuinely unprecedented situation,ï¿½?says the person. âIâve never seen another case where you have such a high return for creditors, settlement of legal and regulatory matters and improving operating performance all in the same short period of 18 months.ï¿½?Li and Guoâs turnround strategy includes closing down underperforming stores and increasing the price of a cup of coffee by 60 per cent to an average of $2.50 ï¿½?still half the price of an equivalent Starbucks coffee. Luckin claims it has reduced property and staffing costs through the use of an âin-appï¿½?purchase system and has started using franchisees to expand the number of its stores rather than owning them all outright. It has also had remarkable success with new beverages, including a coconut velvet latte that sold out over the summer. Xu Xueqiong, 36, a small business owner in Anqing, a city in Anhui province, is an avid fan of the drink. She says Luckinâs branding, use of coupons and sweeter flavours âsuit Chinese peopleâs consumption habitsï¿½? Michael Norris, a senior research analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina, says that Guoâs gamble to start using franchisee partners to share the risk of opening new stores, especially in lower-tier cities, has paid off. Revenue from those stores has tripled in the last quarter compared with the same period the previous year, according to its financial statements. But analysts have warned that Chinese consumer habits are fickle, and Luckin is increasingly fighting competition from domestic rivals with substantial financial backing, including a new, trendier competitor, Manner Coffee. Norris adds that investors may be sceptical at reports of accelerating growth: âRevenues rising sharply is something that those of us who have been following Luckin have seen before.ï¿½?Luckin reported a net loss of $859mn for the 2020 financial year. In the first nine months of 2021, its net losses were $3.6mn, according to its financial statements. Carson Block, founder and head of Muddy Waters, says he is âsurprisedï¿½?at Luckinâs turnround: âIn the old days, companies were finished once confirmed that they were frauds, especially to the extent of Luckin.ï¿½?âBut Luckin seems to be saying the fraud is water under the bridge. That now theyâve raised the money on the back of lies, theyâre putting it to use and becoming real,ï¿½?adds Block. Winning back trust Far harder than inventing coconut lattes will be the job of convincing foreign investors and regulators that its finances can be trusted. Luckin is setting out plans to relist at a time when tensions between the US and China over the quality of Chinese companies listed in US markets is at an all-time low. The most recent case was the disastrous listing of Didi, a ride-hailing app, last June, when regulatory blocks by Beijing days after its flotation meant its shares crashed by 80 per cent and investors lost billions. Since then, new flotations by Chinese companies in the US have been in effect paralysed. Both Washington and Beijing are wary of continuing to permit the deepening of financial links between Wall Street and corporate China. To relist on the Nasdaq centralised exchange Luckin needs to first formally exit bankruptcy proceedings, which according to an individual involved in the process should happen in the next few weeks. It then needs to re-register with the SEC before making an application to Nasdaq. The exchange can deny a companyâs listing if it believes investors might be at risk, but in general, it is required to accept those companies that meet the exchangeâs requirements. The SEC and Nasdaq refused to comment on Luckinâs relisting plans. The company will also need to navigate new laws that have come into place in the wake of its 2020 scandal which make the US a far less hospitable environment for Chinese companies going public. The US Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which was passed in late 2020, puts pressure on Chinese companies to make audit papers available for inspection. It could force about 240 Chinese companies worth a combined $2tn to delist from US exchanges over the next few years. âThere is no indication that either the US or China will budge on this issue,ï¿½?says Jay Ritter, an IPO expert at the University of Florida, who added this made the environment tough for a Luckin return. Under this law, the US authorities could delist companies that fail to submit to US regulatory checks on their audits for three years in a row. This has resulted in a stalemate for companies and their accountants as Beijing does not permit foreign oversight of Chinese companiesï¿½?financial records. As a result, even if it successfully relists, Luckin could be delisted again by US regulators in the future purely because of a lack of access to its audit files. âIf Luckin relists and is trading, whatâs the price discount for the fact that if you buy the shares you donât know if or where youâre going to be able to sell them in two or three yearsï¿½?time?ï¿½?says one accounting expert. Crucial to Luckinâs comeback will be investorsï¿½?confidence that its books are credible, especially given the failures of original auditors EY to identify duplicity, and perhaps also the fact that the CFO at the time of the scandal, Reinout Schakel, is still in place. Since the fraud was exposed, Luckin has had two new audit firms. The group appointed Hong Kong accounting firm Centurion ZD CPA as its auditor in April 2021 after its previous auditor, New York-based Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk, was replaced. Marcum said at the time that it had ânot gathered sufficient independent third-party data or conducted sufficient audit procedures to complete the auditï¿½? As US regulators and exchanges put greater focus on the quality of Chinese company audits, the work of a smaller firm is likely to receive enhanced scrutiny. Centurion, which says it has about 40 accountants in Hong Kong and the US, is registered with the US audit regulator, which allows it to sign off the accounts of Chinese companies listed in America. But so far it audits just a small number of such companies traded on Nasdaq or over the counter. Centurion did not respond to request for comment for this article. In its audit of Luckinâs 2020 accounts, the most recent full-year audited financial statements, Centurion identified as a âmaterial weaknessï¿½?that Luckin lacked âentity level control policies and procedures, including failure to demonstrate commitment to integrity and ethical valuesï¿½? It also said Luckin lacked appropriate separation of duties, including around making investment decisions and use of funds. Even so, some investors may be tempted back into its equity because of Luckinâs growth prospects, according to fund managers. âBy market capitalisation per store, it is a cheap and attractive asset,ï¿½?says a fund manager who has traded Luckinâs over-the-counter shares. âThat means people arenât put off by the fraud.ï¿½?Yet so far, it is primarily China-focused hedge funds and mainland capital that have flooded back into Luckin shares. âItâs hard to see someone like Fidelity getting back into it on day one,ï¿½?the fund manager adds. Winning back the support of large international investors would be critical for Luckinâs comeback story. âI suspect there is work to be done for redemption before that,ï¿½?says Kerrie Waring, chief executive of the International Corporate Governance Network, a lobby group for institutional investors whose members manage global assets of $59tn. âThe focus [for investors and regulators] will be in the integrity of financial disclosures and the degree to which the numbers can be trusted going forward,ï¿½?Waring adds. âThe new external auditors will also be under the spotlight.ï¿½?As investors question whether they can trust Luckinâs turnround story, one former US regulator says the fact that the company is under such intense scrutiny means it may be less likely to repeat past crimes. âSometimes the safest place to eat is a place thatâs just reopened after the health department shut them down.ï¿½?Additional reporting by Nian Liu, Ryan McMorrow and Emma Zhou in Beijing, Robert Smith in London This article has been amended to reflect that the US Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was passed in 2020"
634,0,"BBC bombarded by almost 400,000 malicious email attacks every day",503 words,City AM Online,"This means the BBC is facing an average of 383,278 email threats a day, which is a 35 per cent increase from the daily figure of 283,597 email attacks blocked per day observed by Parliament Street in Summer 2020. In total, the BBC received a staggering 47,143,313 malicious emails during the four-month period between October 2021 and January 2022, of which 70,589 were classified as malware attacks, and 291,042 were phishing emails. This amounts to an average of 2,366 phishing emails and 574 malware attacks, targeting BBC employees every single day. Experts from industry-leading cyber security firms have cited the busy shopping periods, combined with the rising threat of Omicron, as the leading causes for the uptick in attacks. Tim Sadler, CEO and Co-Founder, Tessian, said: âTargeting employees during the busy holiday period is a tried-and-tested tactic used by cybercriminals, who are betting on the fact that people will be busier and more distracted during this time. âIn fact, our own data shows that the most malicious emails are sent during the last 3 months of the year. As the number of email attacks continues to rise year on year, and spikes during busy periods, organisations must find ways to alert employees to potential phishing attacks. Staff must also be regularly educated on the threats they could be exposed to and make aware of what they need to do should they receive one. âThe BBC especially is an attractive target for cybercriminals who are looking to steal information and harvest those all-important credentials. There have been a number of cases where threat actors have targeted journalists in phishing campaigns in attempts to steal login credentials, so that they can take over the account and pose as the journalist in emails to other companies. Under the guise of the journalist, cybercriminals can trick their new targets into sharing information or downloading malware. This is a sophisticated form of spear phishing, and the threats can be difficult to spot.ï¿½?Read more  BBC Exodus: Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel leave the Beeb to start podcast[https://www.cityam.com/emily-maitlis-leaves-bbc-after-two-decades/]  The post BBC bombarded by almost 400,000 malicious email attacks every day[https://www.cityam.com/bbc-bombarded-by-almost-400000-malicious-email-attacks-every-day/] appeared first on CityAM[https://www.cityam.com]."

975,0,Dine-in restaurants in Delhi worry about survival as fresh curbs come in,719 words,Mint,"So far, restaurants in Delhi were allowed to operate on weekdays up until last Friday till 9 pm for dine-in services. DDMA had also imposed weekend curfew in the city shutting down malls and restaurants on Saturday and Sunday. Restaurant operators fear that after Delhi other states may also consider further curbs on dine-in.After one quarter of good business, the closure of eateries for dine-in will wipe out the entire fourth quarter business, they said. Anjan Chatterjee, hotelier and founder of publicly-traded Speciality Restaurants that runs chains like Oh! Calcutta and Mainland China, said all governments have it in their jurisdiction to follow the law till the infection rates go down. ""While the omicron variant is not dangerous, the reality is that the number of cases are soaring. The government has to take steps, but they should find a fine balance so that the most vulnerable industries - - like food and beverage -- are allowed to survive. Deliveries, regardless of the type of format restaurants operate in, do not make up for more than 30-40% of the total turnover,"" he said.Restaurateurs said they have already been complying with various rules imposed and are seeing reduced dine-in revenues of up to 50% due to seating capacity restrictions. Restaurants have also had to comply with business hour restrictions with daily night and weekend curfews that started at the end of December around the New Year festivities.Ajit Shah, co-founder at White Panda Hospitality said such announcements are leading to a working capital crisis since rents have to be paid regardless of the disruption. ""The policies are not conducive to continuing business. Political rallies are still going on and the local government has to realise that we also generate a lot of revenue. They need to supportus too,"" he said.Zorawar Kalra, founder at Massive Restaurants that runs chains like Farzi Cafe, Masala Library and delivery-chain Louis Burger, said he is hopeful that if hospitalisations and morbidities are not increasing, then these restrictions can be quickly removed as they are extremely debilitating for the already beleaguered industry. ""If they continue, they will result in a major increase in permanent closures and unemployment in the sector,"" he said. While dine-in restaurants are in a panicking, for companies whose primary focus has been home deliveries, it is likely to be a good run. Mansher Duggal, co-founder of Delhi-based Enoki Hospitality, that runs ten cloud kitchens for Asian and North Indian cuisines, said from a delivery point of view, they anticipate a spurt in business. His business, he said, saw about 40% growth in the last lockdown in April - May 2021. However, he added that restaurants should be allowed to continue operations with 50% capacity with strict regulations allowing only the fully vaccinated guests, similar to the norms followed in the US and the UK. He said more restrictions on restaurants will send an industry, that is still recovering, into complete disarray. The National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) said that in FY 20-21, the size of the restaurant industry declined by over half to 53% from around Rs.2,00,762 crore that year versus Rs.4,23,624 crore in FY 19-20. The industry body had hoped for a steady recovery but saw only one quarter of good business between October and December 2021. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT."
731,0,"Pro-Russia disinformation persists on Youtube, Twitter",1108 words,The Washington Post,"Pushilin and the Donetsk People's Republic are on the U.S. government's sanctions list, a designation that bars Americans from doing business with them and limits their economic activity. But they have powerful perches across American social media platforms, including Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, where they're helping Russia spread the false narrative that the war will protect the people of Ukraine and that the country welcomes its invaders. (YouTube removed the accounts on Wednesday afternoon following an inquiry from The Washington Post.) Tech companies have taken unprecedented steps to crack down on disinformation about the war in Ukraine, banning Russian state media in Western Europe and adding labels to identify Russian government accounts. But more than a dozen YouTube and Twitter accounts tied to individuals and entities on the sanctions list espouse many of the same talking points as state-backed websites such as Sputnik and RT, largely unfettered. Unlike other sensitive content, there are no labels that identify these accounts as being tied to entities targeted by sanctions. Multiple Facebook and Instagram accounts tied to individuals facing sanctions were identified by The Post this month. These accounts underscore how people and groups blacklisted by the United States retain social media megaphones - even as platforms take more steps to crack down on state-backed propaganda. Some of the accounts were first identified by researchers at Advance Democracy, a nonpartisan nonprofit that conducts public interest research. ""The platforms - and other U.S.-based commercial entities - should not be sitting on the sidelines,"" said Daniel J. Jones, president of Advance Democracy. ""As the death toll in Ukraine climbs, and millions of Ukrainians are forced to flee their homes for safety, it's imperative that every sector of our society contributes to pressuring Russia to end its brutal attacks and withdraw from Ukraine.""  YouTube, which is a subsidiary of Google, disabled several of the accounts identified by The Post on Wednesday afternoon. ""Google is committed to compliance with all applicable sanctions and trade compliance laws. If we find that an account violates our Terms of Service or our product policies, we take appropriate action,"" YouTube spokeswoman Ivy Choi said in a statement. ""Since the war in Ukraine, we've terminated a number of accounts as part of our compliance actions.""  Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. Companies have faced backlash from Russia's Internet censorship agency for efforts to restrict propaganda. YouTube removed the account of the separatist leader Sergey Aksyonov, one of the accounts identified in The Post's review. On Thursday, Roskomnadzor, the Russian regulator, responded by accusing the company of ""selective censorship"" against Russian political figures and of violating ""the key principles of the free flow of information."" For years, sites such as Facebook and YouTube have faced questions about what limits to impose on leaders who are controversial or even facing sanctions, such as Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of Iran. These questions are more urgent in war. As bombs rain down on Ukraine, the proliferation of propaganda highlights a difficult task for tech companies, said Karen Kornbluh, director of the German Marshall Fund's Digital Innovation and Democracy Initiative. ""Social media platforms are caught in the middle of an information war,"" she said. ""While they're taking steps to avoid profiting from providing information, and against state media, they're not acting as aggressively to take down content - in part because they see value in providing access to information."" As companies make decisions on accounts tied to those targeted by sanctions, they risk setting precedent, said Justin Sherman, a fellow at the Atlantic Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative. If tech companies label accounts of people and groups targeted by U.S. sanctions, autocratic countries around the world could pressure the companies to label dissidents and civil society organizations on which they impose sanctions, he said. The vast majority of the accounts tied to those facing sanctions are posting in Russian, apparently directing their message at people in Russia or eastern regions of Ukraine. YouTube, which hosts some of the accounts, is one of the only major American social networks that can be accessed in Russia, after the country's government restricted Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Sherman said that as companies seek to crack down on propaganda, they should prioritize falsehoods spreading in the conflict zone. ""The most imminent harm from propaganda is not to a populace in a foreign country, as much as it is to people getting incited to commit violence in Ukraine against Ukrainians or Russians in Russia who are being told lies,"" he said. Sanctions experts say there's been little government action to clarify what responsibility tech companies have to remove accounts or posts from people and organizations on the U.S. sanctions list, placing the subject in a legal gray zone. Limiting those communications could run afoul of laws to protect free speech. Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit that has represented former tech company employees and contractors, filed a pair of disclosures in recent months with the Justice Department and Treasury Department, arguing that it was illegal for Facebook parent company Meta to host such content. Those complaints could force the federal government to clarify its positions, especially as the U.S. government turns to unprecedented sanctions to punish Ukraine. The Russian government and embassies have retained a broad number of accounts across social media platforms, especially Twitter. Twitter has begun labeling government accounts, and it removes individual tweets when they break their rules. On Twitter, the DNR maintains at least four active accounts, a Post review found. One called @DNR_online_ with more than 4,200 followers has shared tweets in line with Russian propaganda about the war. The same group maintains at least two active accounts on YouTube. At least seven individuals targeted by U.S. sanctions appear to have active Twitter accounts, and at least two maintained accounts on YouTube that the company removed Wednesday.

81,1,Fashion rental pioneer expands for new season,656 words,"The Journal, Newcastle","In the firm's most significant deal to date, M&S used Hirestreet's Zoa technology to trial the rental of clothing for customers who want to both spend less on clothing and reduce waste. It proved to be such a success that Hirestreet has now launched a second collection, in the biggest ever retailer collaboration for the Haylofts based accessible fashion rental platform. Rosie Hartman, strategy lead, Hirestreet, said: ""We are delighted to continue our partnership with M&S, with the launch of the Spring collection, making this our largest ever retailer collaboration. ""With a reputation for stylish and quality clothing, M&S items have proved popular from the moment they launched on Hirestreet."" Founder Ms West launched Hirestreet in a bid to reverse the fast fashion trend, which sees millions of items of clothing bought each year, worn a handful of times and then sent to landfill. Starting off with a handful of her own dresses, Ms West has grown the company to rent thousands of dresses every week - and diversification has seen the company add more than just occasionwear to its website. In January, Decathlon launched its first UK rental collection, consisting of an exclusive ski-wear and outerwear edit, and other brand partners have also come on board, including Ghost, French Connection, ASOS, Nobody's Child and others. Since M&S launched its first collection through Hirestreet last November 98% of customers indicated they would rent M&S clothing again from the platform, 95% of Hirestreet customers said they were impressed with the quality of their M&S products and nearly 90% would look to purchase from M&S in the near future. The new Spring collection is made up of 40 new season womenswear pieces from M&S's in-house brands Autograph and Per Una, as well as for the first time M&S Collection, all available to rent from Â£10 for four days. Starting with 16 looks this week, new styles will be added throughout the season. The M&S team has worked with Hirestreet to test and learn clothing rental behaviours. Although the fashion rental economy is typically associated with formal dressing, 53% of Hirestreet customers rent M&S products for casual social events. To date, M&S has proved to be the most popular brand for a 'bundle', which allows customers to select three different outfits for a 30-day rental period for Â£50. Ms Hartman said: ""Clothing rental is often associated with special occasions, but the popularity of M&S clothes, many of which are versatile for any occasion, demonstrates how the future of fashion rental is changing - today rental fashion is more than just providing temporary access to designer items. ""We've thoroughly enjoyed working with the team at M&S to curate the perfect collection for the new season and can't wait to hear the response from our customers."" Richard Price, MD of clothing and home, Marks & Spencer, added: ""At M&S our focus is ensuring our product is more relevant, more often for our customers' lives - that's not just what we offer but how. ""We know customers are increasingly interested in the circular economy and rental which is why we started our exciting partnership with Hirestreet last year. The feedback so far has been great with Hirestreet users discovering the everyday style and value of our clothing on the platform. We're continuing to test and learn this Spring/Summer with a new collection which is perfect for a range of occasions - including the holidays and special events."""

He said that India would plead for the cesession of the war lest the economies of food producing countries was being affected if the Russian-Ukraine war continues. Kataria claimed that India was the second largest wheat producing country and the government was making every effort to increase wheat production.

13,0,Economic Watch: Inclusive finance helps small enterprises weather epidemic-induced challenges,865 words,Xinhua's China Economic Information Service,"""Before the epidemic, cash flow on average would come in at 3,000 yuan (about 471 U.S. dollars) per day, but now we have seen a decrease of more than 1,000 yuan on average every day,"" said Chen, who is also beset by rising costs of labor and auxiliary materials. Chen ran from pillar to post in search of funding, but his business is too small to be collateral for securing a sufficient loan amount. Amid the gloomy days, he saw some rays of hope when one day he came across a credit product that does not require collateral. At his wits' end, Chen decided to give it a try. He submitted his personal information via mobile phone, and because his credit record was good, he got a credit line of 100,000 yuan that is recyclable in use within minutes. ""It was a timely help,"" Chen said. In light of the uncertainties and challenges posed by the complex global situation and the sporadic resurgence of COVID-19 on the domestic front, China intends to assist market entities, particularly those with smaller scales, by rolling out favorable policies. Inclusive finance is being vigorously developed across the nation, especially in light of the epidemic. Official data showed that the balance of inclusive loans to small and micro enterprises was 19.1 trillion yuan by the end of 2021, with a growth pace quicker than that of other loans. The year-on-year growth rates of inclusive loans offered to small and micro businesses by China's state-owned five commercial banks all remained above 30 percent last year. Inclusive finance aims to meet the financial needs of all social strata and groups with a focus on smaller enterprises, people with low incomes and those in rural areas in China. Chongqing Fumin Bank, which helped Chen ride out challenges, is a trailblazer in the sector and has extended its service scope to small and micro businesses such as restaurants, convenience stores and laundries. Thanks to the innovative financial model, financial institutions are able to provide large-scale, low-cost and efficient services through digital technologies including online platforms, big data and artificial intelligence. ""Financial products are embedded in the procurement and payment platforms commonly used by small and micro enterprises,"" said Yan Dong, executive vice president of Fumin Bank. By leveraging big data technologies, the bank could draw precise customer profiles and provide loans based on their personal credit, tax payment and procurement data, Yan added. The intelligent audit system, which also relies on digital technologies, sets more than 100 preconditions such as identification and overdue records, automatically checks whether an applicant meets the loan conditions, and evaluates the business status of customers to prevent risks to the greatest extent. Similar to Chen's wonton business, a pastry shop run by Ye Cai in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, has also been affected by the epidemic. Thanks to inclusive finance, Ye is now accustomed to applying for loans on the mobile phone to solve the problem of capital turnover. ""When the business is really bad, or I need to replace big equipment, I would apply for a small volume of loans for timely help just on my fingertips,"" Ye said. While small and micro enterprises in China are seeing an improving financing environment, there are still structural problems obstructing them including difficulties in applying for the initial loan, credit loan and medium-and long-term loans. But it is evident that the country will continue to promote the high-quality development of inclusive finance. In this year's government work report, China has proposed to further improve the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, channel more funds into key areas and weak links, and expand the coverage of inclusive finance. In February, the meeting of the central commission for deepening overall reform reviewed and adopted guidelines on advancing high-quality development of inclusive finance, setting clear directions and targets in the next steps. ""Promoting high-quality development of inclusive finance will help small and micro market entities better cope with complex situations and overcome challenges, as well as help ensure and improve living standards, and promote recovery and healthy development of the economy,"" said Dong Ximiao, chief researcher with Merchants Union Consumer Finance Company Limited. After receiving financial support, Chen Ping and his wife were busy again. He is mainly responsible for purchasing raw materials, and his wife makes wontons in the kitchen. This is the main source of income for the family. ""Although the epidemic has impacted our business, I am confident that the difficult period will pass,"" Chen said. Enditem"
836,1,Rite Aid Q4 Adj. EBITDA Rises; Announces Cost Rationalization Program,313 words,RTT News,"Net loss from continuing operations was $389.06 million or $7.18 per share compared to a loss of $18.50 million or $0.34 per share. The company noted that the increase in net loss is due primarily to a current year charge of $229.0 million for the impairment of goodwill related to the Pharmacy Services Segment. Revenue increased to $6.07 billion from $5.92 billion, a year ago. Analysts on average had estimated $5.95 billion in revenue. For fiscal 2023, the company projects adjusted EBITDA to be between $460 million and $500 million. Adjusted net loss per share is expected to be between $0.53 and $1.06. Total revenues are projected to be between $23.1 billion and $23.5 billion in fiscal 2023.  Rite Aid said it will significantly reduce costs through closure of a total of 145 unprofitable stores, a reduction in corporate administrative expenses and improved efficiencies in worked payroll and other store labor costs. The company expects these cost initiatives to drive savings of $170 million in fiscal 2023."
579,0,"Swiggy, Zomato discounts dry up as restaurants shut, orders surge",677 words,The Economic Times,"âEarlier the aggregators were pushing the habit creation of deliveries but now that the habit has been created, they too have realised that deep discounting is not the way forward.ï¿½?Daryani is also vice president of restaurant association National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI).The chief executive of a premium Delhi-based restaurant chain, however, said, âAs and when the situation normalises and restaurants reopen, we expect the heavy discounts by aggregators to come back.âAn executive at Zomato, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the current decline in discounting is cyclical after heavy Christmas and New Year discounts.Emails sent to spokespersons of Swiggy and Zomato remained unanswered.The development comes amid mass shutdown of restaurants and pubs in some cities, particularly Delhi where the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Monday ordered restaurants and bars to stop dine-in services, allowing only delivery services and takeaways. âThe new guidelines, which prohibits dining completely and allows only deliveries, is completely unsustainable,ï¿½?NRAI president Kabir Suri said.Delhi NCR, according to NRAI estimates, is the second largest organised food service industry in the country. There are more than 95,000 organised and unorganised eateries in Delhi, it said. This latest round of restrictions comes after months of shutdown during the first and second waves, followed by operations being allowed at 50% capacity.Some industry executives pointed to rising raw material and fuel costs to justify higher prices. âVery steep inflation in costs of ingredients is also limiting restaurants and forcing them to cut down on discounts,ï¿½?said Singh of Olive Group.Also, starting January 1, the Centre has directed Swiggy and Zomato to collect and deposit tax at 5% rate to bring food vendors who are currently outside the goods and services tax (GST) threshold under the tax net.Indiaâs largest quick service restaurant chain Jubilant FoodWorks, which operates Dominoâs pizza and Dunkinï¿½?Donuts, recently increased prices by 5-6% across its portfolio. âDominoâs India remains focused on maintaining its value-for-money proposition,ï¿½?the company had said. âWe view the pricing action positively as it helps offset some margin pressure, with limited impact on demand.âCosts of vegetables, edible oils and fuel have increased by up to 20% over the last year. Retail inflation hit a five-month high in December when consumer prices, led by food and manufactured items, rose 5.59% year on year and by 4.91% month-on-month, according to data by the Ministry of Statistics.While dine-in business has taken a hit, sales through delivery have surged in large food services markets such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and Punjab.Zomato and Swiggy reported record numbers of deliveries on New Yearâs Eve. Zomato said it reached 2.5 million orders for the first time in one day, while Swiggy crossed 2 million orders.Mid last year, NRAI had moved the Competition Commission of India (CCI), alleging that Swiggy and Zomato were forcing restaurant partners to give discounts on their platforms to maintain good visibility on the platform, among other allegations.

370,0,It's time to head off-piste,1423 words,The Sunday Times,"""It was crazy busy,"" he said. ""We were worked off our feet. I really couldn't complain."" Wait. What? The thing I hadn't considered was that last year the ski lifts were ordered to close but there was nothing to stop people driving up to the ski resorts to get fresh air into their lungs and have fun in the snow. The only activities open to them were those that didn't require mechanical ski-lifts and this has led to a veritable explosion of interest in off-piste activities. Some of these have been around for ever, such as snow-trekking, ski touring and cross-country skiing, while others are relatively new, such as fat-biking and the latest French trend, Moonbikes. Meanwhile, management at the resorts found themselves twiddling their thumbs on a subsistence wage, so they ended up spending a lot of time looking at their offerings and getting a bit more creative. In just about every ski resort, this phenomenon was repeated. Over in Val d'IsÃ¨re, about 50km to the east of La Plagne, ChloÃ© HarlÃ© of the tourist office talked of how one upside of the lockdown was that it allowed them to reflect on the nature and offer of their resort, and look at ways to improve their range of services. It also allowed time for hotels and restaurants to renovate and dress in their best colours for when the tourists would return to the slopes. And with ski stations being very much on the front line when it comes to global warming, the pandemic also allowed resorts time to beef up their environmental policies. Continued on page 26 ? ? Continued from page 25 Back in on the trail in La Plagne with Philippe, meanwhile, we're crossing a busy piste. Ski slopes can be a bit tricky to negotiate when you're not used to them and I squint my eyes in the bright sunshine. It feels as if I'm trying to traverse a motorway and I can't really tell how fast people are whizzing down the mountain, so I just follow Philippe, ensuring I stay slightly downhill of his position so that in the event of the worst coming to the worst and a skier crashing into us, he'll cushion the impact. Anyway he's an expert so it's not going to happen. We're wearing snowshoes or, as the French much more accurately describe them, raquettes. Once we're on the other side of the piste, we're in a winter wonderland a real one, untouched by humans since the previous night's heavy snowfall. It's all soft white curves and quiet, and we follow in Philippe's assured footsteps, stepping into the deep snow sometimes up to our knees but knowing that it goes much deeper. ""It's like a 4x4 for your feet,"" he says, pointing out that the snowshoe spreads your bodyweight over an area five times larger than you'd otherwise have. The only trick is to ensure to stay upright. A fall in deep snow is hard to get up from both due to the physical struggle involved and the helpless laughing it precipitates. Another unique feature of this part of the world, Philippe points out to me, is the existence of a pine tree that grows only out of the rocks. What? I ask. Right in front of me, there it is a tall, proud, strong pine tree that is rooted in the rock. ""Look, there are some over there too,"" he says, and I turn around to see that half the trees surrounding me are also growing out of the rock, splitting the stone as they get bigger. It is all down to one bird, he says. Without this bird, the tree wouldn't exist, and maybe without the tree the bird wouldn't exist. Who knows? In any case, the bird has a habit of storing up the seeds from these trees in crevices in the rock, in the manner of a squirrel or, say, a Cavan man. For a variety of possible reasons, the bird doesn't return to claim his booty from some of those crevices and, when that happens, the seeds begin to sprout in their hidden rocky enclave and grow into mighty fine trees. The aforementioned Moonbiking is a new off-piste highlight that I, for one, would like to do again and again. It's a bit like an electric-scooter version of the snowmobile. Next to it, the noisy petrolburning engine of the latter looks trÃ¨s passÃ© in our ecologically minded present. Conceived and built locally at Annecy though disguised as an American idea with its name and labelling entirely in English the Moonbike gives you one hell of a thrill-ride over the slopes and through the fields of off-piste virgin snow. At the back of this ""bike"" is a caterpillar track while at the front is a ski in place of a wheel. You steer by leaning left or right rather than by turning the handlebars. It's tricky, but you soon get the hang of it and before you know it, you're whooping with delight in the Alpine night air, tearing up the snowy hillside on a cool ""snowped"" that sounds like an electric rotavator. There's also been a recent explosion in the art of igloo-building on the French slopes. It's a great exercise in teamwork and tremendous knockabout fun. We were four in all me, my son, local tourism rep SÃ©verine and our jovial team leader and former elite mountain infantry soldier Guillaume. We built a small one that just about accommodated a grown man sitting down with his legs crossed. At other resorts, the idea is taken to another level. At Chamrousse, for example, you can dine, warm your cockles with vin chaud and sleep overnight in an igloo. This is a resort that has achieved the Flocon Vert label, distinguishing it as having achieved a high level of sustainability. More and more French ski resorts have this ""green snowflake"" stamp of approval firmly in their sights. In tandem with becoming more ecofriendly and widening their off-piste offer to an increasingly discerning winterholidaying public, some French resorts have been taking a change of direction; rejigging their image in the face of a changing world. Such is the case with Courchevel. Long perceived as the kind of place where Russian or British millionaires like to roll up in their gleaming Jeeps wearing designer ski clothing, the resort is now firmly moving from World Bling Capital to World Ski Capital. Next year, it will be hosting the World Ski Championships and, according to Romain Delasselle, a local tourism representative, it has all the facilities necessary to underpin its reputation for those who like to aim for the highest sporting standards. Similar to its neighbour Courchevel, La Plagne is made up of a series of villages, all of them purpose-built at different stages. This spreading out has helped to keep the resort reasonably quiet and low-key, feeling much smaller and cosier than it actually is. In many ways, it's a great place to get back to the slopes because it offers a wide range of skiing without the feeling of being in an overly busy super-resort. In fact, La Plagne is large and has some 225km of slopes; it was named the world's most popular ski resort in 2014. It is also connected by gondola to both Peisey-Vallandry and Les Arcs, making it part of the enormous Paradiski area, with more than 425km of piste. If you're here for a week, however, you've more than enough to keep you going without having to go elsewhere. la-plagne.com The trick is to stay upright.

874,1,UPDATE1: Fast Retailing 1st half operating profit climbs to record high,441 words,Kyodo News,"For the full year to August, the company lifted its group net profit forecast to 190 billion yen from its earlier estimate of 175 billion yen while maintaining its operating profit and sales outlook at 270 billion yen and 2.20 trillion yen, respectively. ""We were able to log massive growth as the company diversified its global primary sources of revenue,"" Chief Financial Officer Takeshi Okazaki said at a press conference.  Fast Retailing saw its North American operation swing back to the black for the first time since opening its first store in September 2005. It plans to increase the number of stores in the region to 200 within the next five years from 60 by the end of this business year. Nevertheless, it took a hard hit in China as coronavirus restrictions under the country's zero-COVID policy dragged down demand for clothing. Regarding foreign exchange rates, the retailer put its assumed exchange rate for the U.S. dollar at 115.6 yen at the end of the business year, higher than 109.9 yen the previous year. Although a weaker yen is generally considered a boon to exporters as overseas profits are boosted when repatriated, Tadashi Yanai, chairman and CEO of Fast Retailing, expressed concerns over the yen's recent rapid depreciation, noting that it was likely to worsen Japan's economy. The Japanese currency, which has been on a downward trend over the past few weeks, tumbled to its lowest level in 20 years against the U.S. dollar the previous day. Although Fast Retailing suspended operations in Russia on March 10, it had been criticized for a delay in making the decision compared to other major companies, as well as reports of Yanai commenting that Russian people need clothing. The chairman denied that the decision was slow, noting that myriad reasons pushed the retailer to temporarily close its stores, including supply chain constraints and the escalation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ==Kyodo"

Mr. Peak agreed with ZiZiâs decision to close last month, but the continuing uncertainties have left him feeling bewildered and frustrated. When Sharon Hoota, an owner of the restaurant, and his manager recently called the cityâs 311 help line three times to ask what to do if a worker tested positive for Covid, Mr. Hoota said they received differing advice on how soon that person should be allowed to return to work. âTo be honest, in the beginning it was very clear what we should do,ï¿½?Mr. Hoota said. âBut now itâs changing a lot.ï¿½?While businesses throughout the country[https://la.eater.com/2021/12/20/22846672/covid-19-cases-winter-surge-omicron-variant-restaurant-closure-staff-outbreak-2021] have had to calibrate their response to the Omicron variant, few places have been as hard hit[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/nyregion/omicron-nyc-spread.html] as New York City, or as strict in requiring proof of vaccination, for all workers and anyone dining indoors.

264,0,"It's too little, too late': Struggling New York City restaurant owners say lifting vaccine mandate is 'long overdue' and they fear even MORE businesses will be forced to close as customers continue to work from home",1699 words,Mail Online,"* New Mayor Eric Adams announced Sunday that proof of vaccination would no longer be required beginning March 7 as long as COVID metrics don't worsen * He is set to make a final decision on the repeal Friday New York City Mayor Eric Adams' decision to drop vaccine mandates has been welcomed by restaurant and bar owners - but the move is 'long overdue' and 'too late' for many of them which could still be forced to shut their doors due to a lack of customers. Restaurant owners like Robert Mahon, who runs Toro Loco, Amor Loco and Broadstone in Manhattan, told DailyMail.com that lifting the mandate was long overdue. 'It's too late for many of us. The New York Local government has destroyed thousands of businesses so far and unfortunately, many restaurants in non-residential areas are still suffering,' he said. 'There will be more bars and restaurants closing over the next few months regardless of the vaccine mandate being lifted. Until offices return to full capacity, the outlook for many is bleak.' Over the past two weeks, Adams has been stressing the need to get employees back into offices after a study showed that just 28 percent are going into work every day. He said the move was crucial to the city's culture and economy as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations stabilize from an early-January peak. 'In order for our economic - financial ecosystem, I should say - to function, we have to have human interaction,' Adams said last week Wednesday. But until that happens, the bleak outlook is shared by other businesses across the city, including Joey Hayes, the manager of Short Stories bar in the East Village, who told DailyMail.com that the mandate has been difficult and polarizing. 'In New York City it's been a little tough because we have gotten villainized for these mandates. Instead of customers being thankful that we are protecting them and public health, they asked why we were doing this,' she said. 'They asked why we were putting up walls and boundaries but all we were doing was trying to protect our business from getting shutdown'. A staggering number of restaurants across the city have shuttered since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020. According to Eater New York [https://ny.eater.com/2022/1/7/22851679/nyc-restaurant-closings-january-2022], at least 1,000 bars and dining establishments have shut their doors with some economic experts alleging the number is even higher. Mayor Adams announced on Sunday that proof of vaccination would no longer be required for indoor dining, fitness, and entertainment values beginning March 7 as long as COVID metrics don't worsen. He is set to make a final decision on rescinding the mandate Friday. Other major cities - including Chicago - have already made moves to lift their vaccination proof requirements as key data revealed the worst of the Omicron surge is behind us. COVID cases in the U.S. are reaching a low point, with the nation having only recorded 7,464 new infections of Sunday. The move to lift restrictions comes after several New York City restaurants made the decision not to enforce the vaccine mandates, and thousands were forced to shut for good after two years of punishing lockdowns. In August 2021, a group of Staten Island restaurants and other businesses sued then-Mayor Bill de Blasio and the city over the mandate, who called it 'arbitrary, irrational, unscientific and unlawful'. 'These restrictions have severely and irreparably damaged small businesses all over the City,' the lawsuit stated. The mandates have also caused an uproar among customers. In September, a hostess at famed restaurant Carmine's was attacked by three Texas women who were part of a group where some were refused entry for not showing proof of their vaccine. The women, who were later charged, claimed the Asian hostess called them a racial slur - a claim the hostess denied. After Adams' announcement lifting the restrictions, Short Stories manager Joey Hayes told DailyMail.com that having to check for proof of vaccination was a 'very invasive' process. 'Needing to ask customers requirements questions as soon as they walk into an establishment has been tough,' she explained. 'You want to give customers a beautiful experience, asking for vaccination proof created a playing field that wasn't great and lifting this requirement is going to help with customer experience. 'It was initially put in place to protect everyone, but I think now we can go back to the way we experienced customer service and hospitality before.' The restaurant and bar manager also explained how pandemic restrictions negatively impacted business, noting the proof of vaccination requirement was initially met with reluctancy. 'A lot of people in New York City were vaccinated already, so it wasn't a fight for us specifically, but it did absolutely affect the business,' Hayes said, noting that on her travels she found many other states were not conducting vaccine checks. 'Initially we saw a big impact, especially when there was reluctancy to get vaccinations. There was reluctancy to be around people in general. It took until July when we saw a pick-up in business and August is when we saw people starting to arrive in more of a normal volume. Now, we're back to seeing the numbers we saw in previous years.' She added: 'We used to work with flus and colds and all these types of things in the past and we need to get that way again.' Hayes also noted her establishment has adapted to all sorts of COVID restrictions and if there 'comes a time' when they need to conduct vaccination checks again, they will do so. Similarly, NYC Hospitality Alliance Chair Andrew Rigie reiterated the importance of officials continuing to be 'smart and safe and modify mandates as COVID risks are reduced.' 'So, removing proof of vaccination for indoor dining in NYC will be welcome news to many restaurants and bars, although I wouldn't be surprised if some biz want to voluntarily keep it in place,' Rigie tweeted Sunday night. The National Federation of Independent Business, in a statement issued to DailyMail.com Monday, said: 'This is welcome news for New York Cityâs small businesses that for nearly two years have suffered enormous losses and endured unrelenting economic challenges while managing ever-changing, one-size-fits-all public health mandates. 'With New York Cityâs high unemployment rate and small businesses facing a record number of job openings, eliminating barriers to hiring is necessary and critically important. Itâs time to return to some semblance of normalcy and focus on rebuilding the cityâs fragile small businesses.' Mayor Adams announced his push to end the proof of vaccination mandate over the weekend after New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that the state would be dropping its mask mandates. 'I want to thank the millions of New Yorkers who masked up and helped us reach unprecedented levels of vaccinations,' Adams tweeted Sunday. 'We've fought a long, hard battle. And we're winning it because of the grit and determination of every day New Yorkers like you.' The indoor mask mandate for schools will also be lifted the same day, providing there are no unexpected virus spikes. 'New York City's numbers continue to go down day after day, so, as long as COVID indicators show a low level of risk and we see no surprises this week, on Monday, March 7 we will also lift Key2NYC requirements,' Adams announced. 'This will give business owners the time to adapt and will allow us to ensure we are making the best public health decisions for the people of New York.' Prior the Sunday's announcement, Adams had indicated he was eager to lift COVID restrictions and help businesses return to pre-pandemic normalcy. 'We can't close down again and I'm not going to do something at my anticipation to get back that's going to jeopardize closing down the city again,' Adams said during a press conference last Wednesday. 'Our economy can't handle it. We don't have another $11billion to put back in the economy. We must do it the smart way.' The mayor also shared that he meets with health experts daily who had been providing structure and benchmarks the city needed to meet before foregoing coronavirus restrictions. The Big Apple was one of the hardest struck places in the world by the Omicron variant leading up to Christmas and into the new year. Cases jumped more than ten fold in a matter of weeks, from around 3,000 per day to 40,000 per day in early January. Daily infection figures began to plummet afterwards, though, dropping all the way back down to around 5,000 cases per day by the end of January. A similar trend occurred in much of America, where massive population centers were struck hard and early by the highly infectious variant before seeing cases rapidly decline after peaking. On Sunday, the U.S. only recorded 7,464 new infections of Sunday. While Sunday is always a day where the U.S. records less infections than others - many local health departments are closed on the day - this is the first time less than 10,000 cases were recorded on a single day since July 11 of last year. Previous 'small' Sunday totals so far this year have been upwards of 70,000. The nation's daily case average has fallen to as low as 66,337 per day, a 34 percent decrease over the past week, and a whopping 91 percent fall from the 800,000 case per day record reached in mid-January."
768,0,Call It âCodger Power.ï¿½?Weâre Older and Fighting for a Better America.,1364 words,NYTimes.com Feed,"Weâve seen this close up: Over the past few months, weâve worked with others of our generation to start the group Third Act[http://thirdact.org/], which organizes people over the age of 60 for progressive change. Thatâs no easy task. The baby boomers and the Silent Generation before them make up a huge share of the population ï¿½?nearly 75 million people[https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/Aging%20and%20Disability%20in%20America/2020ProfileOlderAmericans.Final_.pdf], a larger population than Franceâs. And conventional wisdom (and a certain amount of data) holds that people become more conservative as they age, perhaps because they have more to protect. But as those musicians reminded us, these are no normal generations. Weâre both in our 60s; in the 1960s and ï¿½?0s, our generation either bore witness to or participated in truly profound cultural, social and political transformations. Think of Neil Young singing âfour dead in Ohioï¿½?in the weeks after Kent State or Joni Mitchell singing âthey paved paradiseï¿½?after the first Earth Day. Perhaps we thought weâd won those fights. But now we emerge into older age with skills, resources, grandchildren ï¿½?and a growing fear that weâre about to leave the world a worse place than we found it. So some of us are more than ready to turn things around. Itâs not that there arenât plenty of older Americans involved in the business of politics: Weâve perhaps never had more aged people in positions of power, with most of the highest offices in the nation occupied by septuagenarians and up, yet even with all their skills, they canât get anything done because of the countryâs political divisions. But the daily business of politics ï¿½?the inside game ï¿½?is very different from the sort of political movements that helped change the world in the ï¿½?0s. Those we traditionally leave to the young, and indeed at the moment itâs young people who are making most of the difference, from the new civil rights movement exemplified by Black Lives Matter to the teenage ranks of the climate strikers. But we canât assign tasks this large to high school students as extra homework; thatâs neither fair nor practical. Instead, we need older people returning to the movement politics they helped invent. Itâs true that the effort to embarrass Spotify over its contributions to the stupidification of our body politic hasnât managed yet to make it change its policies yet. But the users of that streaming service skew young[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/spotify-statistics/]: Slightly more than half are below the age of 35, and just under a fifth are 55 or older. Other important pressure points may play out differently. One of Third Actâs first campaigns, for instance, aims to take on the biggest banks in America for their continued funding of the fossil fuel industry even as the global temperature keeps climbing. Chase, Citi, Bank of America and Wells Fargo might want to take note, because (fairly or not) 70 percent[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/millennials-own-less-than-5percent-of-all-us-wealth.html] of the countryâs financial assets are in the hands of boomers and the Silent Generation, compared to just about 5 percent for millennials. Awakened older Americans could push hard on these banks. Not every older person is financially comfortable ï¿½?which puts the onus on those of us who are ï¿½?but weâve heard from thousands of people who do not want their life savings used to undermine the life chances of their children. Or think about the equally crucial fight to protect democracy. Older Americans vote in huge numbers; they were 44 percent[https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/] of the electorate in 2020, with boomers closely divided on their presidential choice and those over 75 clearly favoring Donald Trump. Many older Americans still tended to support the candidates and party backing voter suppression ï¿½?but Joe Biden narrowed those margins. Older Americans must be reminded that we witnessed the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, perhaps the most American thing that Congress has done in our lifetime. Thatâs why weâre assembling what we call a Democracy Force of older volunteers to make the phone calls and write the letters to potential voters around the country (and yes, itâs worth remembering that older Americans have more time at their disposal). Reminding one another of the early years of our lives is, we think, key. If our first act was pretty fascinating, the second act for too many of our generations focused harder on consumerism than on citizenship; we drifted into an individualism that fit easily with the Reagan ethos of looking out for oneself. But if it worked for us, it clearly isnât working for the planet or the society as a whole ï¿½?younger people realized that, which is why they took up the âOK, boomer,ï¿½?cry, and weâve begun to realize it too. Older voters began drifting back to Mr. Biden in the last election, but we think that drift needs to grow into a wave if weâre going to defuse the challenges facing us. And it can. Plenty of people donât take older Americans seriously as political actors. If you read Twitter in the wake of the Spotify kerfuffle, there were lots of comments about âhas-been artistsï¿½?and âgeezers.ï¿½?We prefer âexperienced Americans,ï¿½?but if you want to talk about codger power, then so be it (and by the way, donât dis our music ï¿½?people on music services are mostly[https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/is-old-music-killing-new-music] streaming old tunes). Since weâve begun organizing Third Act, itâs been amazing to watch people come in out of the cold to help, people like Sam Brown, who in 1969 helped organize the vast Vietnam Moratorium Day, which drew millions into the streets, and now is helping run the campaign challenging banks on climate change. âBack then those vast demonstrations started with just a few people,ï¿½?he said at our national virtual teach-in last month. âWeâve just got to believe we can do what we need to do ï¿½?and if we believe it enough, we probably can.ï¿½?What really should scare the corporate and political bad actors is the prospect of old and young people connecting, because there is real power if we work across generations. Last fall, young activists called for demonstrations outside the fossil-friendly big banks, and they invited us to join in. We did, with a certain amount of gallows humor (âFossils against fossil fuelsï¿½?read one banner in Boston). And by the end of this week, younger artists were joining in the Spotify boycott. The soul singer India Arie[https://www.instagram.com/p/CZah4f1OLIJ/] and the podcaster Roxane Gay[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/opinion/culture/joe-rogan-spotify-roxane-gay.html], both 40-somethings, had pulled their work, too. This particular dust-up wonât be a decisive battle in the struggle for a better America and a better planet; in fact, there may not be any decisive battles, just a long series of skirmishes that must be engaged by the young but also by the old.

913,0,Twitter permanently bans news aggregation service Politics For All,428 words,The Guardian,"A spokesperson said the account was âsuspended for violating the Twitter Rules on platform manipulation and spamï¿½?and would not be allowed to return. Politics for All, founded by 19-year-old Nick Moar, grew rapidly over the last twelve months by aggressively aggregating news stories published and reported by mainstream outlets. Its understanding of what would go viral on Twitter attracted hundreds of thousands of followers, including MPs and government ministers. However, the account was also accused of distorting stories by focusing on specifics that would go viral. Mainstream journalists also complained that its emoji-laden breaking news posts would often attract more social media shares than the posts by the outlets who actually reported the stories. Despite this, its substantial following enabled the account to rapidly disrupt political news cycles by highlighting stories that might otherwise have been missed. It also built a relatively mainstream fanbase ï¿½?with the likes of former Manchester United footballer Gary Neville among those calling for the account to be reinstated. Moar, who was last year hired by the Spectator to run its social media accounts, declined to comment on the deletion of Politics For All. Many other related accounts he set up under the For All banner, which were run with the assistance of a team of young staff, have also been permanently suspended. One individual at Politics for All said: âThe fact Twitter will allow the Taliban on their platform but not a simple news aggregator is quite something. We will be appealing this decision.ï¿½?However, it is unclear how the aggregator could appeal against the permanent suspension, which is similar to the treatment handed out to former US President Donald Trump[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/03/trump-twitter-account-judge]. Twitter has stated the suspension is final and its rules on platform manipulation[https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/platform-manipulation] apply to users who âartificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behaviour that manipulates or disrupts peopleâs experienceï¿½? The specific behaviour that led to Politics for All being banned remains unknown. The deletion of a relatively popular news aggregation service by Twitter could attract political scrutiny. Social media platforms will soon be regulated by Ofcom under the forthcoming online harms legislation, with mainstream journalism outlets lobbying hard to ensure their access to audiences is protected."

60,1,Big Industry Output Grows 8.6pc In February,528 words,The Nation,"According to the PBS, the LSM has recorded growth of 8.6 percent in February 2021. The LSM has rebounded after months of a downturn on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, mainly in the automobile, construction, textile, food, chemicals, non-metallic mineral products and pharmaceutical sectors. However, high-interest rates and depreciation of the rupee will increase the cost of raw materials further and economic activities are expected to slightly slow down during the current financial year. Ministry of industries, measuring output trend of 36 items, recorded a growth of 3.7 per cent in production. Provincial Bureau of Statistics, counting production of 65 products, logged 4 per cent growth. Oil Companies Advisory Council, logging outputs of 11 oil and petroleum products, has recorded 0.1 percent growth in first eight months of the ongoing financial year. Wood products, the top contributing sector to the overall big industry output, increased by 174 per cent, food 3.3 per cent, beverages 1.7 per cent, tobacco 19.6 per cent, automobiles 59.8 per cent, furniture 345.2 per cent, machinery and equipment 12.4 per cent and iron and steel products 17.3 percent during July-February 2021-22 compared to the same period last year. The sectors showing decline during July-February 2021-22 compared to the same period of the previous year included pharmaceuticals 2.3 per cent, rubber products 22.7 per cent, fabricated metal 7.1 per cent, transport equipment 1.9 per cent and electrical equipment 1.1 per cent. The industrial sector was projected to grow by 6.5 per cent based upon the large-scale manufacturing target of 6 percent. Moreover, another challenge for the manufacturing sector is high cost and low supplies of energy inputs. The construction sector is expected to post healthy growth due to the construction amnesty scheme and concessional credit availability for the housing sector. The LSM in the 1HFY22 has recorded a growth of 7.4pc compared to 1.2pc over the corresponding period of FY21. The World Bank in its recent report noted that government consumption also grew strongly with vaccine procurement. On the production side, agricultural output, mainly rice and sugarcane increased, reflecting better weather conditions. Similarly, large-scale manufacturing growth rose to 7.5 percent y-o-y in H1 FY22, higher than the 1.5 percent for H1 FY21. In contrast, business and consumer confidence have fallen since June 2021, partly due to concerns about higher inflation and interest rates."
112,1,"ROSEN, SKILLED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages C3.ai, Inc. Investors with Losses Over $100K to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - AI",834 words,Newsfile,"WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the C3.ai class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=3839[https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/moNq8temPO] or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com[mailto:pkim@rosenlegal.com] or cases@rosenlegal.com[mailto:cases@rosenlegal.com] for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than May 3, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, the Offering Documents were negligently prepared and, as a result, contained untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading and were not prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations governing their preparation. Additionally, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding C3.ai's business, operations, and compliance policies. Specifically, the Offering Documents and defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) C3.ai's partnership with Baker Hughes was deteriorating; (2) C3.ai's was employing a flawed accounting methodology to conceal the deterioration of its Baker Hughes partnership; (3) C3.ai faced challenges in product adoption and significant salesforce turnover; (4) C3.ai overstated, inter alia, the extent of its investment in technology, description of its customers, its total addressable market, the pace of its market growth, and the scale of alliances with its major business partners; and (5) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the C3.ai class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=3839[https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/kzLq7U18xv] or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com[mailto:pkim@rosenlegal.com] or cases@rosenlegal.com[mailto:cases@rosenlegal.com] for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

67,1,"First Criminal Trials Over Wage-Fixing, Hiring Practices End in Loss for Justice Department; Denver jury acquits DaVita Inc. and former CEO of striking deals that DOJ alleged limited options for sought-after workers",827 words,The Wall Street Journal Online,"The two prosecutions marked the first ever federal criminal cases focused on alleged labor-market collusion. The antitrust division has pursued civil cases in recent years against companies that entered into agreements to not raid each other's workers, but charging the conduct as a crime marked a major escalation of the government's approach.  DaVita and another healthcare firm, Surgical Care Affiliates LLC, had agreed to refrain from hiring each other's senior employees unless the current employer was aware of the possibility, according to prosecutors. DaVita and Mr. Thiry were charged in July 2021. Surgical Care Affiliates LLC was indicted in January in Dallas federal court and similarly charged with conducting illegal no-poach agreements. That trial is scheduled for January 2023.  DaVita and Mr. Thiry had argued that prosecutors were overreaching by declaring non-solicitation agreements to be illegal. Courts hadn't found that such deals were inherently anticompetitive, the company said. DaVita and Mr. Thiry were acquitted after an eight-day trial and two days of jury deliberations. ""We appreciate the jury's decision and are grateful to put this matter behind us,"" DaVita said in a statement. ""We remain committed to operating with integrity and upholding the highest standards of law."" When businesses agree not to recruit or hire each other's workers, it robs employees of opportunities, information and the ability to use competing offers to negotiate better terms, the Justice Department has argued. President Biden last year ordered the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, which share antitrust enforcement authority, to better protect workers from wage fixing[https://www-whitehouse-gov.proxy.library.nyu.edu/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/] and other actions that can restrict labor-market competition. In the Texas case, Neeraj Jindal and John Rodgers had been accused of trying to recruit at least five competitors to lower pay for physical-therapy assistants working in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Mr. Jindal, who owned the company, was indicted during the final months of the Trump administration, while Mr. Rodgers was charged last year. Jurors acquitted Messrs. Jindal and Rodgers of conspiring to fix prices after a nine-day trial. The men were also acquitted of a second conspiracy charge related to allegations that they impeded a federal investigation of their conduct. However, Mr. Jindal was convicted of obstructing that probe, which was initially done by the FTC, while Mr. Rodgers, the clinical director, was acquitted. Paul Coggins, an attorney for Messrs. Jindal and Rodgers, said he was disappointed that Mr. Jindal had been convicted on the obstruction charge but pleased that jurors had ""caught on about the antitrust counts."" Mr. Coggins said prosecutors couldn't show that any physical therapists or physical-therapy assistants had their pay reduced because of an anticompetitive agreement. Any reductions in contractor pay stemmed from home-healthcare agencies being paid less by Medicare, he said ""There were no victims here. There was really no harm here, so there was no anticompetitive effect,"" Mr. Coggins said. ""It was an odd case for the DOJ to make a bellwether case."" A Justice Department spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment. The FTC said in a statement that it was pleased the jury found that Mr. Jindal schemed to thwart its investigation. ""I don't think this changes their intent to move forward with these kinds of cases,"" said Ted Hassi, a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton LLP specializing in antitrust litigation. ""If DOJ has a string of losses, I could see them re-evaluating which cases to take and how to approach them."" Mr. Jindal owned a company based in suburban Dallas, Integrity Home Therapy, which he sold in mid-2017, according to FTC records. Earlier that year, Messrs. Jindal and Rodgers approached several competing companies and sought an agreement to lower pay rates for physical-therapy assistants, according to an indictment issued in April 2021. After the FTC began investigating the two men, they withheld information from the agency and supplied misleading documents and false testimony to the agency, according to the indictment.

Blended same store sales thus declined in 2021 by 5 percent, but the contraction was at a lower pace versus the prior year. Notwithstanding the disruptions caused by the typhoon, MRSGI stores in the Visayas demonstrated resilience as their sales generally improved in subsequent months. Both food retail and general merchandise businesses were flattish versus the same period last year. Despite the ease of mobility in the latter part of the year, stringent quarantine measures were reimplemented due to the increase in COVID-19 cases across the country, while consumers continued to prune expenses to the bare essentials. Meanwhile, the Company's sales from its e-commerce business more than doubled in 2021 on the back of the 5x growth of MRSGI's own online platform. MRSGI registered an operating income of PhP84.99 million this year, a reversal of the PhP302.52 million loss in 2020, following the decline in operating expenses. The Company's operating costs decreased for two consecutive years as a result of its ongoing efforts to increase efficiency and implement cost saving measures. In 2021, MRSGI cut its operating expenses by 12.0 percent to P5.96 billion from P6.78 billion last year. It managed to maintain a positive EBITDA in 2021 at P1.22 billion, while its cash reserves amounting to P1.67 billion remained sufficient to cover its current debt. As the country further reopens, MRSGI remains optimistic on the recovery of brick-and-mortar stores. The Company affirms its commitment to expand its network particularly in the underserved areas and innovate the look and feel of its physical stores. In 2021, MRSGI's flagship store Metro Ayala Cebu Department Store completed its rebuilding and reopened its doors to the public, while four new stores were added - Metro Danao Supermarket and Department Store, Metro Tacloban Department Store, and Metro Sum-ag Supermarket."

""This is also the responsibility of the intermediaries. YouTube should also see that these are absolutely fake news,"" he said, referring to India's new intermediary rules notified last year. This is the second instance of the government blocking YouTube channels and websites linked to Pakistan in the last month. On December 21, the government said 20 YouTube channels were ordered to be blocked under emergency provisions incorporated in the information technology rules last February. YouTube later took down those channels. Union minister of information and technology Anurag Thakur said that any social media account trying to mislead the public would be taken down. ""Any account that is trying to spin a conspiracy or mislead the people will be actioned,"" he told reporters. An officias statement released on the action against ""Pakistani fake news factories"", said these channels had over 12 million subscribers and over 1,320 million views. They include Khabar with facts, Khabar Taiz, Information Hub, Flash Now, Mera Pakistan With, Hakikat Ki Duniya and Apni Dunya Tv. ""These channels were spreading misinformation about the Indian army, including conspiracies that the death of chief of defence staff Bipin Rawat was an assassination,"" said Vikram Sahay, the ministry's joint secretary and designated officer under the information technology law. ""These threaten the sovereignty and the integrity of India."" According to the ministry, the YouTube channels, websites, and other social media accounts blocked were used by ""Pakistan to spread anti-India fake news about sensitive subjects related to India"". ""These include topics such as the Indian Army, Jammu and Kashmir, and India's foreign relations with other countries. It was observed that rampant fake news was spread through the YouTube channels regarding the demise of the former Chief of Defence Staff Late General Bipin Rawat. These YouTube channels had also started posting content to undermine the democratic process of the upcoming elections in five states,"" the ministry said in an official statement. ""The channels propagated content to encourage separatism, divide India on the lines of religion, and create animosity among the various sections of the Indian society. Such information was feared to have the potential to incite the audience into commission of crimes adversely affecting public order in the country."" The directions to block the content has been issued using the emergency powers granted to the secretary of I&B, who can order an immediate takedown of content under the new social media and intermediary guidelines. The interim order will be placed in front of the inter-departmental committee for review. The inter-departmental committee forms the apex of the three-tier redressal mechanism, which includes a self-regulatory mechanism, followed by regulation by industry bodies. The committee, in a first, also has members from the industry body - one member each from the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry and Confederation of Indian Industry, one member from the Bar Council of India and a member from the Press Council of India. Besides these, the committee also has members from ministries such as the ministry of women and child development, ministry of law and justice, ministry of home affairs, ministry of electronics and information technology, ministry of external affairs and ministry of defence. The guidelines have, however, been challenged by various media consortiums in court for leading to censorship of news content.

729,0,Social media platforms must address Russia's Spanish-language misinformation,847 words,The Boston Globe,"That's because social media posts in Spanish have spread rapidly with propaganda and conspiracy theories that blame the United States for the armed conflict and accuse the United States of not telling the world a key fact: that there are American chemical and bioweapon development facilities in Ukraine that were threatening to Russia. Not surprisingly, the media outlet pushing the biolabs conspiracy theory ï¿½?already debunked ï¿½?is RT en EspaÃ±ol, the Russian-controlled television network. Its Facebook page in Spanish posted as recently as Thursday morning a clip of Russia's defense ministry announcing that Russian experts have found new evidence that biological weapons were being developed secretly in Ukrainian labs funded by the United States. It bears repeating: That is false information. And yet the Facebook post remains unflagged as such and continues to rake in high levels of engagement through hundreds of likes, shares, and comments. Similar Spanish-language posts have been flagged by mis- and disinformation experts to urge Facebook and other tech companies to do more to detect and delete these blatant falsehoods. This isn't a new issue. Misinformation in Spanish has rapidly spread on social platforms ï¿½?and often gone unchecked or left up longer than it survives in English ï¿½?about the COVID-19 vaccines and the 2020 presidential election. As the Russian invasion unfolded in Ukraine, Facebook and TikTok banned Russian state media in Europe, while YouTube blocked them globally as it became evident that Kremlin-controlled outlets were spreading propaganda. But according to experts, Spanish-language misinformation and conspiracy theories have a longer shelf life than their English counterparts on social media because, by and large, the platforms are not dedicating enough resources and time to fight them. It's way overdue: Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and Twitter better catch up and take the threat of Spanish-language misinformation seriously. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus is on it and requested meetings with Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and Twitter earlier this year to urge them to take more aggressive steps to tackle misinformation in Spanish. Members of the caucus âhave also called publicly for online platforms to release information on their effectiveness at detecting the prevalence of violative content separated by language,"" wrote caucus members in letters sent to the four tech companies in January. âEverything they do in English should be mimicked in Spanish,"" Democratic Representative Ruben Gallego of Arizona, a member of the caucus, told Politico. The false biolabs narrative has become particularly pernicious and resistant to purging. According to a review by Media Matters, in partnership with the Latino Anti-Disinformation Lab, the Russian-owned news agency Sputnik Mundo is also pushing the conspiracy theory on Twitter and Facebook that the United States âwas experimenting with bat coronavirus samples in the biological laboratories"" that they falsely claim America has in Ukraine. There's also evidence that Russia's propaganda efforts in Spanish began before the war started and that Facebook should be doing more to fight them. âBefore Russia invaded, RT en EspaÃ±ol was spreading this idea that the United States was the reason for possible escalation,"" said Jacobo Licona, a disinformation researcher at Equis Labs, a Latinx research and polling company. Those misleading posts, he said, âhad a very high level of engagement."" As a corrective measure, Facebook said it would try to lower engagement by not recommending those RT en EspaÃ±ol posts to users. But Licona told me engagement at RT en EspaÃ±ol is even higher than before the invasion. âFrom January 23 to February 23, there were on average 56,000 daily interactions on the page. But since February 24 to now, the average has nearly doubled to almost 100,000 daily interactions,"" Licona said. The problem with misinformation is that it doesn't have any borders, Licona said. âContent originated in Latin America often reaches the US Spanish-language community and vice versa."" What's more, a video with misinformation in English that's posted on YouTube may not get flagged and removed before a Latin American influencer does their own Spanish version, which eventually makes its way to the Spanish-language-speaking audience in the United States. It's a vicious cycle. âSpanish-language misinformation is a challenge of hemispheric proportions,"" Licona said. He is right. And whether it is about US elections, the coronavirus vaccine, the Russia-Ukraine war, or even social movements like Black Lives Matter, Spanish-language misinformation cannot remain a blind spot for the tech companies any longer.

733,0,"Autistic' English boy, 16, is thought to be mastermind behind LAPSUS$ hack of cyber security firm Okta, Microsoft and Nvidia - and now has a net worth of $14MILLION: Dad says 'I just thought he was playing games'",839 words,Mail Online,"* His father told BBC his son is 'very good on computers' but he did not know about the hacking allegations until recently * Police in London on Thursday arrested seven people, aged 16-21, in connection with hacking case, but they would not say if Oxford teen was among them * LAPSUS$ has been tied to hacks of multiple major companies, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Samsung Electronics and Okta  An autistic 16-year-old boy living with his mother in England is suspected of being the multimillionaire mastermind behind the hacking group LAPSUS$, which has been blamed for a series of high-profile ransom attacks targeting Microsoft, Nvidia and the security authentication firm Okta. Cybersecurity experts hired by the hacked companies said that they have been able to trace the breaches to a teen living near Oxford, who goes by the online monikers 'White' and 'breachbase.'  Bloomberg[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-23/teen-suspected-by-cyber-researchers-of-being-lapsus-mastermind?sref=ylv224K8], which first reported on these revelations, did not identify the 16-year-old because he is a minor.  BBC described the suspect as autistic and attending a special education school in Oxford, and reported that he was alleged to have earned a jaw-dropping $14million through his hacking activities. The hackers' mode of operation is to steal data from a company and then demand a ransom to release the information. On Thursday, London police announced that they have arrested seven people, between ages 16-21, in connection with the LAPSUS$ hacks, but the agency did not say whether the alleged mastermind was among those detained. Police stated that all seven suspects have been released pending the outcome of the investigation.  BBC reported that it has spoken to the suspected LAPSUS$ leader's father, who told the network that the family were concerned about his online activities and were trying to keep him away from the computer. 'I had never heard about any of this until recently,' the father, who was no named, told BBC. 'He's never talked about any hacking, but he is very good on computers and spends a lot of time on the computer. I always thought he was playing games.' He added: 'We're going to try to stop him from going on computers.'  Bloomberg reported that the teen lives with his mother in a modest home located about 5 miles away from the world-renowned Oxford University. DailyMail.com is not naming the teen at this time because police have not confirmed that he has been charged with a crime. Speaking to reporters through the intercom, the mother was said to have told Bloomberg that she was not aware of the allegations of cyber-hacking against her son. Four researchers working on this case said they have been unable to 'conclusively' tie the 16-year-old every one of LAPSUS$'s hacks. The cybersecurity experts also have identified some of the other suspected members of the hacking collective, including another teenager living in Brazil. LAPSUS$, which is believed to be based in South America, has not been shy about its illegal online exploits. In a series of posts on the messaging app Telegram, members of the shadowy group boasted that they had breached Okta, the San Francisco-based company that helps employees of more than 15,000 organizations securely access their networks and applications.  Okta confirmed on Tuesday that hackers may have accessed data from hundreds of its after digitally breaking into the laptop of an engineer at a Miami-based contractor.  Okta's shares plummeted 11 percent amid criticism of the digital authentication firm's slow response to the intrusion. LAPSUS$ previously claimed responsibility for hacking Nvidia, Samsung Electronics and the gaming company Ubisoft Entertainment, the maker of Assassin's Creed. LAPSUS$ also claimed to have snatched source code from Microsoft's Bing search engine, Bing Maps and the Cortana digital assistant program.  Microsoft confirmed the breach in a blog post on Wednesday, saying that the hackers gained 'limited access' to its source code, and that the attackers had compromised a single account. 'No customer code or data was involved in the observed activities,' the blog entry read. 'Our cybersecurity response teams quickly engaged to remediate the compromised account and prevent further activity.' According to Microsoft, LAPSUS$ started targeting organizations in the UK and South America before setting its sights on international targets, including governments, tech companies, media, retail and healthcare sectors. Although cybersecurity experts said they have only recently identified the 16-year-old suspect, his name has been circulating on social media and in hacking circles for months, ever since his rivals had 'doxxed' him by revealing his real name and other personal information."
974,0,Germany blames Malaysian owner for shipyard bankruptcy,266 words,Associated Press Newswires,"The German government had earlier said it was willing to discuss a 600 million-euro ($678 million) bailout plan that would protect 1,900 jobs. But German officials made clear that they wanted Genting, which is majority-owned by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay, to contribute at least 10% to the rescue effort. âThe German government did everything to prevent the insolvency of MV Werften and thereby save jobs,ï¿½?Economy Minister Robert Habeck told German news agency dpa. âHowever, the owners rejected our offer of help; the bankruptcy application is the result.ï¿½?Habeck called it âbitter newsï¿½?for those employees in the economically depressed state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Dpa quoted him saying that the federal and state governments would continue to discuss the shipyard's future in the coming weeks.

He has refused to do so. ""We suspended all corporate support for the Russian market, including operations, marketing, and supply chain support in addition to refusing approvals for new investment and expansion.""

823,1,*Suedzucker: Suedzucker Expects Significant Earnings Increase In The First Quarter Of The Current 2022/23 Financial Year,782 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"DGAP-Ad-hoc: Suedzucker AG / Key word(s): Quarter Results/Forecast ???????Suedzucker expects significant earnings increase in the first quarter of the current 2022/23 financial year 14-Apr-2022 / 14:05 CET/CEST Disclosure of an inside information acc. to Article 17 MAR of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, transmitted by DGAP - a service of EQS Group AG. The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Positive initial outlook for full fiscal 2022/23 despite Ukraine war After a very positive start to fiscal 2022/23, Suedzucker AG expects EBITDA and operating result for the first quarter of fiscal 2022/23 (1 March to 31 May 2022) to be significantly higher than last year's levels (Q1 2021/22: EBITDA: EUR 121 million; operating result: EUR 49 million). For fiscal 2022/23 as a whole, Suedzucker expects group revenues of EUR 8.7 to 9.1 (2021/22 year: 7.6) billion. We see EBITDA in a range of EUR 660 to 760 (2021/22: 692) million and consolidated operating result in a range of EUR 300 to 400 (2021/22: 332) million. The war in Ukraine, which has been ongoing since the beginning of the 2022/23 financial year, has further intensified the already high volatility on the sales markets and price increases on the procurement markets. The resulting economic and financial impact and the duration of this temporary exceptional situation, in addition to the Corona pandemic, are difficult to assess. In addition, the risks associated with the Corona pandemic continue to exist. The forecast for the first quarter and the full year is based on the assumption that the Ukraine war will remain temporary and regionally limited, that the physical supply of energy and raw materials is guaranteed and that the sales and procurement markets will partially normalize during fiscal 2022/23. In this context, Suedzucker's expected transfer of the significantly higher prices, especially in the raw material and energy sectors, into new customer contracts will be of decisive importance. The annual report for fiscal 2021/22 - including detailed forecast for fiscal 2022/23 - will be published on 19 May 2022, and the quarterly report for the first quarter of fiscal 2022/23 on 7 July 2022.

355,0,"Buy, fix, sell: What Blackstone's planning for Crown",673 words,The Sydney Morning Herald - Online,"Blackstone has not revealed how it intends to turn around the beleaguered Crown, which in the past two years has come close to losing its Sydney and Melbourne casino licences over probity concerns and been battered by the COVID-19 pandemic. But the world's largest alternative asset manager - with $US881 billion ($1.2 trillion) in assets under management across private equity, real estate, debt and infrastructure - has considerable experience buying, overhauling and selling casinos across Las Vegas, Europe and Latin America. Casino industry analyst Ben Lee, who runs the consultancy IGamiX, said Blackstone first step would be to parachute in a team of American executives and start cutting costs. ""They've got no interest in running casinos long term,"" Mr Lee said. ""So they will slash and burn, they will cut costs and make it very lean, fix it up, and then sell it off."" Blackstone bought the Cosmopolitan casino and hotel on the Las Vegas Strip in 2014 for $US1.8 billion, spent about $US500 million sprucing it up and then sold it for $US5.65 billion in September last year. Blackstone owns two other hotels in Nevada's famed Sin City - the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay (bought for $US4.6 billion in 2020) and the Bellagio (bought for $US4.25 billion in 2019) - as well as Spanish gambling outfit Cirsa, which has 147 casinos globally, mostly in Latin America. Blackstone also has a track record of turning around hotels and hospitality businesses: it owned Hilton Worldwide for 11 years before selling it in 2018 at a $US14 billion profit - triple its initial investment. Last year the firm bought a controlling stake in UK domestic holiday market leader Bourne Leisure, US hotel operator Extended Stays, and a portfolio of eight Japanese hotels. The Chinese high-roller market Crown spent years pursuing has been sidelined by the banning of ""junket"" tour operators in NSW and Victoria after the Age, Sydney Morning Herald and 60 Minutes revealed many were linked to international crime rings. Mr Lee said that meant Blackstone will be more focused on local customers, particularly by luring rival The Star Sydney's domestic VIP gamblers across to the new Crown Sydney tower at Barangaroo. Forager Funds' chief investment officer Steve Johnson, whose fund has a small shareholding in Crown, said Blackstone would probably refinance the company with higher levels of debt than equity markets were comfortable with, and then split Crown's property assets off from the operating business. ""If you can separate those two things you'll get more combined value,"" Mr Johnson said. ""They've got experience running these assets, but my guess is that in 10 years' time they probably don't want to own either."" Blackstone leases its two remaining Las Vegas casinos out to MGM International to operate in a model analyst and investors say it could pursue here by bringing The Star in to run the Crown properties. Chris Tynan, Blackstone Australia's senior managing director and head of real estate, said in a statement on Monday that Crown played a ""pivotal role in Australia's economy through job creation, investment and as a tourism destination for locals and visitors alike"". ""We are excited to bring our local expertise and global hospitality and gaming experience to contribute to Australia's post-pandemic recovery and position Crown for future growth,"" he said.

382,0,Packer pack slumming it in new digs,1013 words,The Australian,"The move, we understand, is all part of Consolidated Press Holdings boss Guy Jallandâs ongoing austerity push at the private group. The five-year lease in the Castlereagh St building in the centre of the Harbour City, which is home to ANZâs Sydney headquarters, was signed by former CPH boss Rob Rankin amid his then (but since abandoned) grand plans for Packerâs private empire. The Packer campâs shift to more low-key premises in Macquarie House on Macquarie St also comes amid a significant reduction over recent years in the number of CPH staff that the billionaire employs. Also at play is the impact of the pandemic, which has seen many employees working Â­remotely. CPH also has a reduced need for office space now that an increasing number of Packerâs key executives, like the billionaire himself, are based offshore. Jalland lives in Monaco, while Packer has a portfolio of luxury homes around the world, including in the US (where his children live) and Argentina. Crown is facing an $8.9bn offer from New York-based investment giant Blackstone. When Packerâs influence at Crown was at its peak, there had been a plan for CPH to move its premises closer to Barangaroo, where Crown Sydney has been developed at a cost of $2.2bn, once the Liberty Place lease Â­expired. However, the profound change in the relationship between Crown, its regulators and its 36 per cent shareholder Packer meant close corporate proximity was no longer viable or necessary. Empty nest Amid the turmoil that has engulfed Crown Resorts in recent years, its billionaire major shareholder James Packer hasnât touched down on Australian soil since the start of 2020. That visit was with partner Kylie Lim by his side and included an inspection of the Crown Sydney construction project. Fast forward two years and Packer has now settled on his record-breaking $72.2m purchase of an apartment taking in the 48th and 49th floors of Crownâs One Barangaroo, with Packerâs pad designed by Blainey North. Records reveal the billionaire, whose wealth was last estimated at $4bn, purchased the prestige real estate via his existing Victoria Fields Pty Ltd corporate vehicle, whose directors comprise former Crown director Mike Johnston and Catherine Davies. Packer himself has not been a director of the company since 2008. The transfer documents were signed on the private companyâs behalf by MinterEllison partner David McElhone. Packer now has a leasehold on the sky-home that expires 2120. No mortgage was required for the purchase. But thatâs a lot of money to let sit idle with the front door locked while the businessman lives offshore. Last October Packer told the Perth royal commission into Crown that he was ânot sure yetï¿½?whether heâd move into his Crown apartment. Maybe he can list it on Airbnb? Uncertain bid Meanwhile, Crown Resortsï¿½?suitor Blackstone has yet to finish the second phase of its due diligence into the casino groupâs operations. So-called phase one of the process was completed by mid-January, when Crown told the market it would recommend a binding $13.10-a-share offer from Blackstone ï¿½?should one be forthcoming and if no higher bid lobs. Since then, so-called second phase of Blackstoneâs due diligence has been under way, along with negotiations over the terms of an implementation agreement, which are continuing. But letâs remember that the James Carnegie-led local arm of Blackstone does not have exclusive access to Crown, with former suitors Oaktree and Star Entertainment, and possibly others, still potential bidders. Blackstone already has 10 per cent of Crown, which it bought from Melco at $8.15 a share in April 2020. Packer had the year before sold that stake to Melco, led by his friend and former business partner Lawrence Ho, for a much greater $13 a share. Blackstoneâs now $13.10-a-share proposal is worth about $3.2bn to Packer and clears the psychologically important threshold of $13 at which he sold to Ho. Blackstone, for its part, has created yet another vehicle to facilitate its proposal, SS Silver Finco Pty Ltd, which sits alongside at least three others it has created for the deal. But the longer any deal takes, the further Crown moves away from the tumult of recent years and in the direction of the casino groupâs better prospects for the future under chief Steve McCann and new chair Ziggy Switkowski. We hear there are some in the Crown camp who think $13.10 might not be enough. Differing tastes Still in the realm of the super rich, it appears that billionaire heiress Heloise Pratt and Boost Juice millionaire Janine Allis canât quite see eye-to-eye. At least not when it comes to the highly subjective matter of design. Interior design to be more accurate. Mid-last year Pratt threw down $22m (with the assistance of a mortgage to ANZ) to secure Allis and her husband Jeff Allisâs near-new Toorak mansion, located, by the way, diagonally opposite retail billionaire Solly Lewâs home base. The juice entrepreneurs paid $11m for the block in 2016 and set about building a modern masterpiece with all the bells and whistles. But eight months on from settlement, Pratt has a major internal renovation up and running on her new buy under the watchful eye of Melbourne-based interior design firm KDPO. Seems thereâs no accounting for taste. INSIDE MARGIN CALL Heloise Pratt and Janine Allis donât see eye to eye on style"

316,0,Hong Kong's covid crisis,910 words,The Washington Post,"Though much of the United States is edging into post-pandemic normalcy - albeit against the advice of many health experts - Hong Kong is in the grips of a brutal fifth wave and resorting to extreme measures more common in 2020 than 2022. Flights are banned from nine countries, including the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia. Nonresidents from nearly 140 countries are barred. There is no airmail service to the United States. The daily covid-19 case count recently passed 6,000, with 15 deaths in a recent 24-hour period, and epidemiologists predict cases will likely reach tens of thousands per day. Anyone testing positive is sent into isolation facilities, straining available spaces. In scenes reminiscent of New York City in early 2020, patients have been left outdoors on gurneys or sitting in plastic chairs in the cold February air, waiting for a hospital bed. The city is short of manpower, coronavirus testing kits, quarantine spaces and supplies, and city leaders have been forced to appeal to Beijing for help. For two years, Hong Kong was a model for how to keep the coronavirus at bay, through aggressive contact tracing, on-and-off closures of public spaces and strict social distancing rules. It also boasted one of the world's harshest quarantine regimes, requiring most incoming travelers to spend 21 days in a hotel room at their own expense. It became increasingly isolated and was ridiculed for some of its more drastic steps, such as ordering a mass cull of pet hamsters. But the measures largely worked. So why is Hong Kong entering a crisis just as other countries are opening up? The ostensible reason, offered by local officials and health experts, is that the share of elderly people vaccinated remains pitifully low, less than 40 percent of those over 80. But that's just part of the story. More important have been failures of policy, planning and public messaging. The policy failure has been the government's insistence on sticking with its ""zero covid"" approach, trying to stamp out every case and cut every transmission chain. Local leaders had no real choice, because the policy was imposed by mainland China. Hong Kong desperately wants to fully reopen the border to the mainland, and adhering to ""zero covid"" is the price. But Hong Kong is different from the mainland. It's a dense urban metropolis, an international hub that needs people flying in and out. And its residents are less accustomed to being controlled, more jealous of safeguarding their privacy rights and more likely to flout rules imposed by a distrusted, disliked local government. This defiance has led to an underground economy of people trying to make ends meet. Gym trainers take their mats and equipment to parks to continue lessons. Hair stylists, masseuses and yoga teachers are making home visits. New outdoor watering holes skirt the closure of bars by offering alcoholic drinks with limited take-out food items that no one seems to order. Hong Kong's tough policies always contained multiple exceptions and exemptions, and locals are now taking advantage of loopholes. There was also an abysmal failure of planning. Having kept the caseload and death count to a minimum, officials appear to have been lulled into complacency. They had two years to purchase the millions of test kits now needed, build trust in vaccines and make contingency plans for a surge that would leave hospitals swamped. When this current wave became a tsunami, officials were still meeting and discussing where to build a new makeshift hospital and quarantine center. Finally, there have been glaring issues with messaging. The government expended much effort touting the benefits of the new national security law and promoting its ""patriots only"" election. But not enough was done to prepare the population for an inevitable outbreak. Because the government spent years treating covid-19 as a largely overseas concern, many elderly residents saw little reason to get vaccinated. Can this latest outbreak be contained? And is the ""zero covid"" policy sustainable with omicron running rampant? ""Maybe. If you close off the borders and severely restrict internal activities within Hong Kong long enough, it is theoretically possible to stop transmission,"" said Keiji Fukuda, until recently the director of the School of Public Health of the University of Hong Kong and a veteran of the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But, he said, that would require broad public cooperation and exact a heavy economic toll. ""The real question is not whether the virus can be put back in the bottle,"" he said, ""but what is the end game for this policy?"" In other words, ""zero covid"" in Hong Kong is over. All that's missing is the exit plan."

809,1,Natural Gas Intelligence: Russian LNG exports increased by 19% year/year last month,506 words,PortNews,"The European Union is aiming to gain independence from Russian natural gas supplies before 2030, which could ultimately dent the countryâs LNG export volumes before the end of the year. The EU relies on Russia for about 40% of its natural gas imports. Last month, the bloc imported 1.7 Mt of LNG from Russia, or 26% more than it did during the same period last year, Banchero Costa said. Imports of the super-chilled fuel were also up by 22% from March 2020. The EU was the largest importer of Russian LNG last year, followed by Asia. Banchero Costa analyst Ralph Leszczynski told NGI that Russian export increases last month were mainly related to long-term contracts and not purchases on the spot market. âIf anything, buyers are importing more by bringing forward the cargo dates due to uncertainty about possible sanctions in the future,ï¿½?he added. Kpler analyst Laura Page added that Russiaâs export volumes have also been higher this winter because a fourth train at Yamal LNG in the countryâs Far North came online last year. âWe havenât seen any slowdown in exports from the three Russian liquefaction plants to date,ï¿½?Page told NGI. âMost of the volumes from Yamal and Sakhalin 2 are sold via long-term contract and those are continuing.ï¿½?Page noted, however, that Taiwanâs CPC Corp. reportedly did not renew its long-term contract with Sakhalin 2 when it expired in March. âAs for spot volumes, while there are certainly buyers shunning away from these cargoesï¿½?in Europe and North Asia like Japan, âthese cargoes are being sold. As a result, itâs pretty much business as usual at the moment.ï¿½?she added. Japan still remains a top destination for Russian LNG. Japanese buyers continue to accept contract cargoes from Gazprom PJSCâs Sakhalin LNG facility on Sakhalin Island north of Japan. However, some spot cargoes have been turned away for fear of further sanctions, according to local news media reports. Exports from Sakhalin LNG reached 10.1 Mt in 2021, or 33.3% of Russiaâs total. All the facilityâs cargoes are delivered to Asia, where Japan received the bulk, or 6 Mt last year, according to Banchero Costa. Japan does not plan to withdraw from the Sakhalin 1 and 2 projects. These projects âare essentially important for energy security because the projects allow Japan to procure supplies below the market price, especially amid current high energy prices,ï¿½?Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Koichi Hagiuda said during a press conference this month."
83,1,Big industry expands 8.2pc in February,762 words,Dawn,"The production estimation for large-scale manufacturing industries was made on new base year of 2015-16. However, the PBS also released a separate estimation on the old base of 2005-06. As per the old base 2005-06, the LSM grew by 8.4pc in February from a year ago. The calculations in both estimations show an upward trend as LSM entered a negative growth of 0.1pc in October 2021. It revived to a partial growth of 0.7pc in November 2021 and 3.9pc in December 2021 as per the old base. The lowest positive growth in LSM was noted in September 2021 at 1.19pc, which fell from 12.74pc in August 2021. The second-lowest LSM expansion was observed in July at 2.25pc. The current financial year started with a paltry growth in LSM. On a month-on-month basis, the big industry production increased by 0.3pc. In the first eight months (July-February) of the current financial year, LSM grew by 7.8pc on a year-on-year basis as per the new base. However, the growth is calculated at 4.6pc in the eight months on the basis of the old base-2005-06. Since July 2020, the LSM has rebounded after months of a downturn on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, mainly in the automobile, construction, textile, food, chemicals, non-metallic mineral products and pharmaceutical sectors. The PBS snapshot of manufacturing activity showed that four out of 15 sub-sectors in the LSM dipped in February. High-interest rates and depreciation of the rupee will increase the cost of raw materials further and economic activities are expected to slightly slow down during the current financial year. Production of 11 items under the Oil Companies Advisory Committee increased by 6.8pc year-on-year in February. The 36 items under the Ministry of Industries and Production surged by 10.1pc, while 65 items reported by the provincial bureaus of statistics increased by 7pc. The LSM at 9.73pc of GDP dominates the overall manufacturing sector, accounting for 76.1pc of the sectoral share. It is followed by small-scale manufacturing which accounts for 2.12pc of GDP and 16.6pc sectoral share. As per the PBS data, the entire automobile sector, excluding motorcycles, showed strong growth in February compared to the same period a year ago. Production of tractors surged by 12.8pc, trucks by 99.7pc, jeep by 44.3pc, cars by 61.7pc, LCVs by 52.9pc. No growth was reported in the production of buses during the month under review. The production of motorcycles dipped by 2.2pc, while that of cycles increased by 99.3pc. In the non-metallic mineral sector, the production of cement output dipped by 3pc in February 2022. However, the production of glass plates and sheets was up by 58.9pc. In the steel sector, billets and ingots posted a growth of 34.7pc. The production of phosphate fertilisers rose 9.4pc in February and nitrogen fertilisers 0.5pc, respectively. In pharmaceuticals, the output of tablets fell by 28.2pc, injection by 38.3pc and capsules by 42.2pc. However, the output of syrups is up by 63.4pc and ointment 3.7pc, respectively. On the other hand, cooking oil production posted a positive growth of 8.5pc, tea blended increased by 13.2pc in February from a year ago, while wheat and grain milling output declined by 1.6pc. The output of a few petroleum products posted growth in February. The output of petrol fell by 0.5pc and that of high-speed diesel by 1.3pc, whereas furnace oil production dipped by 8.7pc. The production of LPG is up by 4pc, kerosene 22pc, lubricating oil 14.9pc, and jet fuel oil 27.5pc, respectively. In February the sectoral growth shows that food manufacturing posted growth of 3.3pc, beverages 1.7pc, tobacco 19.6pc, textile 2.9pc, garments 20.6pc, leather products 3.1pc, wood products 174pc, paper and board 8pc, chemicals 7.1pc, non-metalic min 0.6pc, iron and steel 17.3pc, and machinery and equipment 12.4pc."
73,0,"As Olympic torch is lit in hope, I see light at end of the tunnel",790 words,Sunday Herald,"When Ivy League universities in America are closing their doors and sending students home until August, donât rule out the first cancellation of an Olympic Games since World War II.? The IOC and host nation Japan are still confident that the Games will go ahead as planned, but no one has any real idea on how long this might go on for. Just from athletes I have spoken to, there is definitely real concern over the Games. The concern isnât just over whether the games get cancelled or not. For each individual athlete, it is also over their own preparations. As an athlete, getting sick is never great and if you got this virus bad you might face missing weeks of training. It could result on you missing the podium in Tokyo.? Or missing the Games altogether. Another friend of mine told me of his concerns that if they move the Games then he might not even get selected.? With markets crashing and supermarket shelves being cleared, these are definitely interesting times for everybody. But when you are living during this Covid-19 pandemic with a spinal-cord injury I guess it becomes even more daunting ï¿½?as such an injury can remove your cough and sneeze reflex. With very little core function, the thought of not being able to cough is a pretty scary proposition.? This might not sound too bad. But this virus hits elderly people hard ï¿½?and this also includes your biological age due to underlying medical conditions. So this is a scary time, and I completely feel for everyone in the same boat as me how scary this is.?I remember back to catching the flu in November last year ï¿½?I thought I was going to stop breathing. I couldnât cough to clear my lungs as the level of my injury is right at the nerves which go to the lungs.? It knocked me out for weeks, so I would be lying if I said I wasnât slightly scared of Covid-19 and its possible effects on my lungs.? I am a very optimistic person who always looks for solutions over problems. But I must admit this has got me a little bit shaken.? Watching whatâs happening in Italy has been hard to believe ï¿½?particularly as life seemed to be continuing almost as normal here.? I looked at the MRI of a 44-year-old manâs lungs and it was unbelievable, unfortunately he didnât survive.? So I am staying positive but also taking advice from Austrian neurologist Viktor Frankl.?He speaks of acceptance of your current situation. These are his own words ï¿½?which I have had on my wall for the last four years: âThe meaning of life lies in finding a purpose and taking responsibility for ourselves and other human beings.ï¿½? In other words, by having a clear âwhyï¿½?we can face all the âhowï¿½?questions of life. This has got me through all those hours in hospital and continues to serve me daily.? Thereâs a reason that in-flight safety presentations always instruct us to secure our own oxygen masks before assisting fellow passengers. We canât help others effectively unless we first protect ourselves. So I spoke with a medical oncologist friend and they advised me to self-isolate.? I am now on day four and thinking this could be a long road ahead; thankfully the weather is getting warmer and I got out on my bike for a few laps of Richmond Park. Along with indoor turbo sessions I am well prepared mentally for the process. I guess all my time in hospital equipped my mind to deal with self-isolating. It also probably helps being an introvert.? I canât help but think of the poor people undergoing their cancer treatment right now though, as I prepare for my own hospital appointment in a few weeks, but I am grateful that side of things is under control. My main goal is keeping my immune system strong because another issue I have from my spinal-cord injury is a compromised immune system, thus moving me into a vulnerable group.? Itâs hard to go from a strong athlete to now feeling so vulnerable, but thankfully I have a strong mind."
849,0,"TikTok, Facebook, Twitter called on to fight election lies",902 words,AFR Online,"Misinformation and disinformation from bad actors are in the sights of the Australian Electoral Commission ahead of the formal campaign getting under way. ""Australian citizens have the right to believe that the earth is flat and we've got to be careful to remember our role is to talk about the election and not the general beliefs of voters,"" Mr Rogers told The Australian Financial Review. ""We'll be responding to correct information and occasionally, we'll be reaching into the social media companies and asking them to remove information where it is entirely misleading."" Major platforms have previously co-operated with authorities in the lead up to voting day and an electoral integrity assurance taskforce will co-ordinate responses in 2022, bringing together police, intelligence and security agencies. The AEC is already being more active in responding to incorrect online claims and conspiracy theories about how the electoral system works, seeking to avoid reputation damage seen by electoral authorities overseas. Mr Rogers said he was concerned about the ""broad ecosystem"" online and was determined to maintain community confidence in the AEC's independent and apolitical position. TikTok wrote to the major political parties in late 2021 warning against any move to advertise on its platform, including through paid endorsements by influencers. Planning for a varied COVID-19 overlay in the poll due before the end of May, the AEC boss said a special virus variants response unit was working to be prepared for a range of scenarios. He said voters would have confidence they could safely cast a ballot in 2022. The AEC has tracked local government elections and national polls overseas to assess COVID-safe voting systems and is working with Melbourne's Deakin University on systems to speed up passage through polling places. ""I think Australians really dislike queuing. Not just dislike, there's a visceral hatred. There's a sweet spot of about 15 minutes before people start to complain,"" Mr Rogers said. ""If you look overseas at people waiting many, many hours relatively patiently. We are doing our best to manage that in a very complex environment."" Early voting is also expected to rise again in 2022. Mr Rogers said more voting by mail was expected, and the AEC was working to implement changes to early voting rules. In-person early voting will be limited to 12 days, sparked by changes recommended after the 2019 election. Early voting will open the Monday of the week before election day. A record 4.76 million early votes and about 1.5 million postal votes were cast before the May 2019 poll. In total, 41 per cent of voters lodged their ballot papers early, compared with 31 per cent at the 2016 election. Parties and candidates increasingly run their campaign activities to target voters in the first few weeks of the campaign, rather than over the whole election period. The law allows early voting when individuals are away from their home electorate on polling day, if they are at work or have religious or medical reasons. The Morrison government ditched controversial plans to require voters to show ID at the polls before Parliament rose for the Christmas break. ""We are preparing to ensure citizens understand it is going to be safe to come in and vote by which every mode they choose, that we'll have all the measures in place to make sure it is safe and secure,"" Mr Rogers said. Most complex logistics event He said federal elections represent Australia's most complex peace time logistics event. ""We get a few weeks' notice and we've got to build a 100,000 person workforce and train them and character clear close to 40,000 of them. ""We print close to 60 million ballot papers and find 8000 polling places and co-ordinate the logistics behind that."" Parliament passed new laws requiring security risk assessments of computerised systems used for the scrutiny of votes, as well as independent accuracy assessments of vote counting software. To be registered by the Australian Electoral Commission, minor parties will be required to have an elected member in Parliament or at least 1500 rank and file members, up from the previous threshold of 500. Disclosure rules on donations and third party political campaign support have also been tightened, prompting Mr Rogers to encourage first time and independent candidates to ask for help navigating the complex systems of rules and regulations. Rules around authorisation of political messages, requiring the source to be clearly identified, remains one common area of difficulty. ""If in doubt, authorise messages,"" Mr Rogers said. ""For many of these groups it will be their first touch up against the electoral system. We have a trove of information on our website and I would urge everyone who is thinking of standing to jump on and read information for candidates, parties."""
634,1,Korean Airâs stock lags US peers' on slow demand recovery,527 words,The Korea Economic Daily Global Edition,"Deltaâs stock jumped 6.21%, extending its gains to 36.23% compared to its lows last month. American Airlines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. also soared 10.62% and 7.54%, respectively, on the day. On the other hand, Korean Air rose 0.8% to end at 31,550 won ($25.7) in South Koreaâs main stock market on Thursday, up some 16% from its lows in March. NEED TO CONSULT WITH 170 COUNTRIES That came as US airlines generate much of their sales from domestic flights, while Korean Air heavily relies on international flights. As of 2019, sales of US airlinesï¿½?domestic flights accounted for about 60% of their total revenues on average. Therefore they can increase sales as long as the authorities don't impose regulations on movement within the country. But Korean Airâs domestic flights made up only 4% of its total sales. âIn order for international passenger flights to recover to pre-COVID-19 levels, it (Korean Air) needs to consult with about 170 countries that are restricting entries of Koreans,ï¿½?said Kim Young-ho, an analyst at Samsung Securities Co. âIt could take longer than expected to see a recovery in international passenger flight demand.ï¿½?South Korean airlinesï¿½?stocks have been supported since last year on hopes for recovery with countries worldwide opening their borders.[https://www.kedglobal.com/airlines/newsView/ked202203140022]  The combined market capitalization of South Koreaâs five carriers excluding Asiana Airlines that decided on capital reductions in 2020 more than tripled to 13.3 trillion won from 4.4 trillion won in 2019. âIt is hard to explain the increase only with hopes for improvement in their earnings based on the potential international passenger flight recovery,ï¿½?Kim said. CURRENCY, FUEL Surging fuel prices and the softer won are also expected to hurt Korean Air's earnings, analysts said. Meritz Securities predicted Korean Airâs earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) on a separate basis to fall 36.2% this year while forecasting that its operating profit may tumble 75%. Investors, however, continued to hope for an eventual recovery in international passenger flights. âThe recovery of international passenger flight demand for Korean Air will be slower than that for US carriers, but the trend of rising demand is not different,ï¿½?said Jung Yeon-seung, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities. âSo, (Korean Airâs) share price will follow the demand.ï¿½?By Sung-Mi Shim mshim@hankyung.com Jongwoo Cheon edited this article.

632,0,"Google, Meta face penalties in Russia as deadline passes to open local offices",639 words,Reuters News,"The new rules also require companies to register with Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor and have a system for fielding user complaints. In November, Roskomnadzor listed 13 companies it wanted to set up officially on Russian soil. Last month, it said it would start imposing restrictions by the end of February. Ahead of the March deadline, only a few had complied. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last week, Western governments have urged companies to push back on Putin in any way possible. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a âspecial operation.ï¿½? Apple Inc and Spotify Technology SA had fully complied before fighting began in Ukraine. On Monday, Roskomnadzor's website showed Rakuten Group Inc's messaging app Viber had completed all required steps. Six other companies had fulfilled at least one policy but had not established a Russian legal entity or local office. Those were Google, Meta, Twitter Inc, ByteDance's TikTok, Zoom Video Communications Inc, JOYY Inc's video app Likee, the government website showed late Monday. Meta had been in ""protracted discussions"" with the Russian regulator up until the invasion of Ukraine occurred, Nick Clegg, Meta's head of global affairs, said during a press call on Tuesday. Clegg said Meta sought to comply with the law ""where we feel we can in good conscience do so,"" but added there were other provisions the company felt were difficult to understand. Four companies - chat tool Discord, Amazon.com Inc's live streaming unit Twitch, messaging app Telegram and bookmarking service Pinterest Inc - had taken no steps to comply, according to the website. Likee said its Feb. 16 filing to form a Russian legal entity was under review and it plans to comply with the law. Twitter declined to comment. The other 11 companies did not respond to requests for comment. Last month, Roskomnadzor said it would begin barring non-compliant companies from selling ads in Russia. It previously has said blocking access to the targeted services would be a last resort, and other penalties could include limiting data collection and money transfers. The regulation is a part of a wider campaign for internet control that critics say threatens individual and corporate freedom. Authorities in Russia have issued small fines to social media companies for ignoring demands to censor anti-government activists or information. Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation,"" has curtailed access to Facebook in recent days in retaliation for the platform's censoring state media services, which critics say promote fake news and propaganda. Twitter has also been slow to access on mobile devices. Demand has surged in Russia during the crackdown for virtual private networking (VPN) apps, which can help with circumventing internet restrictions. Three of the top five most downloaded apps on Apple's App Store on Monday were VPNs. They generated a combined 383,000 installs over the past seven days, 15 times more than the prior seven-day period, according to estimates from tracker Sensor Tower.

The company ended FY22 on a strong note, with annual production and sales of 42.15 million tonne (MT) and 40.70MT. ""This records the best ever annual physical performance for NMDC,"" said the company. For this fiscal year, the target is higher. In a report on 12 April, analysts from Motilal Oswal Financial Services said, ""While NMDC has guided for 46MT iron ore production in FY23, we are building in production and sales of 45MT in our estimates. In addition, our price assumption is 10% lower compared with the current price, which leaves headroom for both price and volume expansion."" The brokerage's sum-of-the-parts based target price for the NMDC stock stands at Rs.220. In comparison, shares are trading at around Rs.168 on NSE. Despite its significant gain in CY22, NMDC's shares are still 21% below the 52-week high of Rs.213.20 seen on 12 May 2021. The delay in commissioning its Nagarnar steel plant is a factor that has weighed on sentiments. NMDC will demerge the plant, which analysts believe would be a trigger for the stock. ""Demerger would improve the return ratios and enable the company to focus on the core mining business and NMDC would be supplying ~4.5MTPA of iron ore at arm's length to the demerged steel plant once the plant ramps up to full capacity,"" said a report by Antique Stock Broking.

667,0,Andrew Forrest hits back at Facebook claim he signed away his rights,671 words,The Guardian,"After years of attacking Facebookâs refusal to remove scam ads featuring his face, Forrest launched civil proceedings[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/22/facebook-rejects-andrew-forrests-legal-claim-it-should-be-liable-for-cryptocurrency-scam-ads] against the social media behemoth in California. He alleges the companyâs failure to stop cryptocurrency-related scam ads were ânegligentï¿½?and a âmisappropriation of likenessï¿½? In response, Facebook argued it was protected from liability because Forrest had a Facebook account, and had therefore agreed to the siteâs terms and conditions. Forrest has now hit back at that claim, saying it must have come from a âjunior lawyerï¿½?and emphasising that he launched the suit to protect victims, not himself. âThat was obviously a junior lawyer who didnât know jack about what he was talking about,ï¿½?Forrest told Guardian Australia. He said when fake pages claiming to be him started proliferating on the site, his cybersecurity team worked with Facebook to clear them out, and to do that had to create an official Andrew Forrest page. âThere were âAndrew Forrestï¿½?pages appearing everywhere, particularly Andrew Forrest saying heâs lonely and if youâre out there, and youâre a rich, lonely (woman) ï¿½?This was ages ago,ï¿½?he said. So he âjoinedï¿½?Facebook when an official page was set up to counteract the fake ones, to âstop a crimeï¿½? He said he was taking action in California ânot on behalf of myself ï¿½?which is obviously why a junior lawyer made the comment [that he had signed away his rights]ï¿½? âTheyâve obviously said that hundreds of times to thousands of victims,ï¿½?he said. âIâm taking it on behalf of victims, for them, so nothing to do with me. Iâm not bound by anything from Facebook if Iâm taking action on behalf of victims, not on behalf of myself.ï¿½?Social media ads falsely using Forrestâs and other high-profile Australiansï¿½?faces are being used to sell overpriced goods, or simply to take peopleâs money without providing anything in return, particularly when selling cryptocurrency. In one case, a Bunbury woman lost $670,000 to the scam[https://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/announcements/scammers-use-fake-twiggy-forrest-investment-fleece-woman-out-670000], making payments to Australian and German bank accounts and to a credit card after she saw the fake ads on Facebook and LinkedIn. Forrest has argued since then that Facebook should be regulated as a publisher and made to take responsibility for the scams. He has launched separate criminal proceedings in Western Australia, alleging that Facebook has breached federal money laundering laws by failing to stop the ads. In the case lodged in the United States, he said Facebook was using its algorithms to allow alleged fraudsters to target vulnerable users, so it was ânot simply providing neutral toolsï¿½? âFacebook is directly involved with developing and enforcing a system that subjects its users to illegal content,ï¿½?the court filing states[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/22/facebook-rejects-andrew-forrests-legal-claim-it-should-be-liable-for-cryptocurrency-scam-ads].  Facebook argued that it has limited liability and that its terms of service make it clear that Facebook makes no guarantees it will always be âsafe, secure, or error-freeï¿½? and that it does not control and is not responsible for third parties. In its response, filed in court, Facebook has argued that it cannot be held liable on a number of grounds, including that it is protected by section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act, which limits the liability of websites for third-party content posted on those websites.ï¿½?Although it will not comment on the cases, Facebook has previously told the Guardian that it takes âa multifaceted approach to stop these adsï¿½?and is âcommittedï¿½?to keeping these people off the platform. Guardian Australia has contacted Facebook, now known as Meta, for comment."

294,1,How to Negotiate for Better Pay and Perks When the Job Offer Lands,1170 words,NYTimes.com Feed,"By the end of 2021, the message from her human resources department informed her, she would be required to return to her office full time. No exceptions. It was late August, and Ms. Hill, who lives in Seattle, was newly divorced and had primary custody of two children still attending school virtually. The flexibility of remote work had become a pandemic lifeline that she wasnât willing to give up. âI never wanted to go back to being bound to having to be in an office, especially as a data professional, where all my work is on the computer,ï¿½?said Ms. Hill, 47, who was a hospital data analyst at the time. âIt was illogical,ï¿½?she said of the return-to-office rule, âbut they were just so rigid about it.ï¿½?She began her job search that same week, determined to find a company willing to give her both the freedom to control her own schedule ï¿½?and a significant pay increase. Within a month, she secured a fully remote job as a senior data analyst with $20,000 more in base salary, unlimited paid time off plus stock options. âI really just said to myself, âStop playing small, and apply for jobs that will pay you the money that you want,âï¿½?Ms. Hill said. Her timing couldnât have been better. Companies advertising remote work opportunities shot up a staggering 357 percent on LinkedIn from May 2020 to May 2021, as employers shifted to attract job seekers who were just as interested in perks like remote work privileges and unlimited paid time off as they were in a good paycheck. In a recent LinkedIn survey [https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/global-talent-trends-report], jobs seekers ranked work-life balance above compensation as their top priority. Employers across multiple industries need to fill roles quickly, drawing from a shallow applicant pool that doesnât always meet that demand. For workers savvy enough to recognize their leverage, it has never been a better time to negotiate a generous compensation offer. Job postings that advertised incentives like signing bonuses doubled from July 2020 to July 2021, according to Indeed.com. [https://www.hiringlab.org/2021/06/24/employer-use-of-hiring-incentives-grows/] And these juicy incentives arenât just for Silicon Valley engineers and National Football League stars anymore. FedEx and Papa Johnâs are offering $500 to $1,000 bonuses for delivery drivers. As a career and money coach, I have seen clients successfully negotiate offers that include substantial salary increases and signing bonuses. The most costly mistake that workers can make these days is leaving the bargaining table without asking for more. Here are some strategies. Make a realistic request for a sign-on bonus. Companies are often more willing to offer bonuses to job candidates than ratchet up their base salary because they have to cover the cost only once. The key when asking for a bonus is to make a realistic request. I advise my clients to start with any amount of money they are leaving on the table at their current employer. That can include unvested equity grants, stock options, unvested 401(k) contributions and even tuition reimbursement funds that they would have to repay upon leaving. Job seekers who arenât necessarily leaving money behind can start by posing the simple question: âIs a sign-on bonus available?ï¿½?Let the employer name a number first. If it presses you for specifics, a good starting place is to ask for 10 to 15 percent of your base salary. Line up multiple interviews. Even if you have your eye on one employer, having competing offers from multiple jobs gives you extra bargaining power. Plus, it demonstrates to prospective employers just how in demand you are. For Ms. Hill, this strategy came in handy. She received an attractive offer from her top choice but asked for a week to decide as she was waiting on an offer from a competitor. During that time, she asked for additional perks she had never considered in previous job negotiations, like restricted stock units (shares in the company that would vest over time). Ultimately, her top-choice company, the clinical software company AdaptX, offered her $15,400 worth of restricted stock units and promised her she could be as flexible with her schedule as she needed to be. Ask for additional equity. If a company offers equity (such as restricted stock units or stock options) as an incentive for new hires, you can always ask for more than the initial offer. Similar to those one-time cash sign-on bonuses, companies are much more likely to sweeten an equity offer than increase your base salary if theyâve already maxed out their budget for the base. Also, if you are leaving equity on the table at your current employer, you stand a good chance of having your new firm cover the cost of any shares youâre forfeiting. You just have to ask. They may request documentation of your vested and unvested equity grants before they cut you a check, so be ready to produce those. Ask for paid time off upfront. After two years grinding away in her health care analytics role in the middle of a pandemic, Ms. Hill was thrilled to find a new job opportunity that paid competitively. But she was still burned out and craved time off to recuperate before starting her new venture. Rather than ask for a later start date and use her savings to cover her expenses in the meantime, she asked her new company to allow her to start the job but immediately take a paid vacation. âI was able to quit my job early and take about three weeks to reset, and I was paid for that,ï¿½?Ms. Hill said. âI thought, âOh, wow.âï¿½?Read the fine print carefully. Perks like sign-on bonuses and equity often come with strings attached. With sign-on bonuses in particular, watch out for clauses that require you to stay employed with the company for a certain period or else have to repay the cash. And restricted stock units [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restricted-stock-unit.asp] are called ârestrictedï¿½?for a reason. They typically are doled out (or âvestï¿½? in batches over several years, and employees can cash them out only during certain periods throughout the year. If youâre granted stock options, which give you the option to buy company shares at a discount, you canât exercise them until you reach your vesting date. Donât be shy about asking lots of questions about how these equity incentives work during your interviews. Just save them for your recruiter, who is more equipped to answer them accurately than a hiring manager.

68,0,Shanghai Disney Resort to Close Monday Amid Covid-19 Surge in China,491 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"China reported 1,656 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases on Saturday, health authorities said, compared with about 70 cases at the beginning of the month. Meanwhile, mainland China reported its first deaths from Covid-19 in more than a year on Saturday as the country battles a surge of Omicron infections. Two patients died of Covid-19 in the northeastern province of Jilin, which has been hard hit by the Omicron wave, Chinaâs National Health Commission said. The deaths, both of which occurred March 18, are the nationâs first recorded fatalities since Jan. 26, 2021. Earlier in the week, Chinese health authorities barred Jilinâs 24 million residents from leaving the province, the first time such restrictions have been imposed on an entire province since Hubei province, home to the city of Wuhan, was locked down at the start of the pandemic. Chinaâthe worldâs most populous countryâhas reported fewer than 5,000 deaths from the coronavirus since the pandemic began in 2020. It has kept infections and death counts low through costly and laborious measures including tight border controls, targeted lockdowns, mass testing and digital surveillance.  Walt Disney Co., which is a minority owner in the Chinese resort, said that its theme parks and resorts generated record income in its fiscal first quarter, signaling that the worst of the damage the company suffered from the coronavirus pandemic may be behind it. Shanghai Disneyland, which first opened in 2016, was the first Disney park to close as the coronavirus pandemic spread throughout China in early 2020. Disney later closed all of its parks, costing the company billions of dollars in revenue. Shanghai Disneyland reopened in May 2020. In late October, Shanghai Disneyland locked more than 30,000 visitors inside its theme park and forced them to take Covid-19 tests after one customer came back positive for the virusâan example of the zero tolerance policy imposed by the Chinese government. China is attempting to move on from its so-called Covid-Zero lockdown measures in favor of a more precise approach to containing the virus that is less damaging to its economy. The updated measures, which include more efficient testing and shorter and more targeted quarantines, are being put to the test by the latest Omicron wave. âElaine Yu, Natasha Khan, Erich Schwartzel and Sha Hua contributed to this article.

But the potential impact on news reporting and sources was a serious concern. News organizations are prime targets for the world's intelligence agencies because their reporters are in constant contact with sources of sensitive information. Journalists and newsrooms[https://apnews.com/article/technology-caribbean-toronto-software-journalists-5f0ebcace3bc8c0f2d21f66cd6278ae1] from Mexico and El Salvador to Qatar, where Al-Jazeera is based, have been hacked with powerful spyware. Mandiant, the cybersecurity firm examining the hack, said in a statement that it ""assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit Chinaâs interests.ï¿½?The timing of News Corp.'s announcement, including in a regulatory filing Friday, coincided with the opening of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, to which foreign athletes and journalists were advised to bring âburnerï¿½?phones and sanitized laptops to protect against cyberespionage. In the regulatory filing, News Corp. said it had discovered in January that one of its technology providers was âthe target of persistent cyberattack activity.ï¿½?It did not elaborate. In an email to staff, News Corp. said the hack âaffected a limited numberï¿½?of email accounts and documents from News Corp. headquarters, News Technology Services, Dow Jones, News UK, and New York Post. âOur preliminary analysis indicates that foreign government involvement may be associated with this activity, and that some data was taken,ï¿½?the email said. âOur highest concern is the protection of our employees, including our journalists, and their sources,ï¿½?it added, saying it believed the âthreat activity is contained.ï¿½?FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a speech this week that the bureau opens investigations tied to suspected Chinese espionage operations about every 12 hours, and has more than 2,000 such probes. He said Chinese government hackers have been pilfering more personal and corporate data than all other countries combined. While state-backed Russian hacking tends to get more headlines, U.S. officials say China has been stealthily stealing far more valuable commercial and personal data over the past few decades as digital technology took hold. Major newsrooms, including The New York Times, against which a Chinese cyberespionage operation was uncovered in 2013,[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/technology/chinese-hackers-infiltrate-new-york-times-computers.html] have previously been compromised. Runa Sandvik, former senior director of information security at the newspaper, said that while major newsrooms have shown a lot of progress in the last few years in helping their journalists navigate an increasingly hostile digital world, those efforts are not adequate to defend against a skilled and determined adversary like China. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington did not explicitly deny Beijing's involvement in the hack, but said in a statement Friday evening that âChina firmly opposes and combats cyber attacks and cyber theft in all forms.ï¿½?The reported onset of the News Corp. hack ï¿½?February 2020 ï¿½?coincides with Beijing's revocation of press credentials of three Journal reporters based in the Chinese capital in what Chinaâs Foreign Ministry said was punishment for an opinion piece the newspaper published. News Corp.'s assets also includes the publishing house HarperCollins, News Corp. Australia and Storyful, which the email to employees said were apparently not targeted by the hackers. ____ Bajak reported from Boston. Associated Press writer David Bauder in New York contributed to this report. ___ The story has been corrected to say that the hacking of Al-Jazeera took place in Qatar."

In total, Hong Kong has recorded 213 COVID-19 deaths and just over 14,000 cases since early 2020, according to the government. (Reporting by Anne Marie Roantree; Editing by Kim Coghill)"

Last Friday, BBC general director Tim Davie said that the firm's reporters were running the risk of criminal prosecution and potentially facing prison terms of up to 15 years ""simply for doing their jobs."" As a result, the firm decided to temporarily halt its reporting activities in Russia until ""all the implications"" of the legislation approved by Moscow had been thoroughly analyzed. Several other foreign media outlets also have suspended their reporting from Russia, including The New York Times, CNN and CBS, Canada's CBC/Radio-Canada, Germany's ARD and ZDF and Bloomberg News.

Since the pandemic began, there have been a total of over five months of forced closures in previous waves, and the longest stretch we have been allowed to do business in the last two years is about 10 months.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge[https://www.scmp.com/knowledge], our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Online classes are out of the question. We mainly teach pole dancing and aerial arts, and the number of students that have the proper set-up to do this at home is negligible. We have had no choice to put all our staff on non-paid leave. We have no idea if they will return as some have had to find other jobs or have left the city. Rent alone accounts for half of our normal expenditure. That is the cost of doing business in Hong Kong, and one we have managed to make work during normal times. How we are supposed to make it work under the current restrictions[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3162190/coronavirus-hong-kongs-fifth-wave-has-already] is anyoneâs guess. I would really love to hear from any other business owners who, over a 30-month period, have had to pay 50 per cent of their regular expenses for at least eight months without any income and who are managing to keep their business afloat.

Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-poâs proposed rental deferment scheme[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3170536/carrie-lam-gives-green-light-hong-kongs] is our last grasp at straws. If it passes, we can try to continue to operate knowing full well that 2022 will be a financial loss as we try to pay back the owed rent from months of forced closure. If it does not pass, we can give up all hope and let the landlord evict us now. Either way, just do it quickly. However, if it does not pass, I think the message is loud and clear. If you are not in real estate, you are not important to the Hong Kong government. Well, good luck trying to rent out property in this city when everybody else has left. Jack Yu, Mong Kok According to the estimates[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3169739/hong-kong-university-data-model-predicts-peak] of University of Hong Kong researchers, there will soon be about 1.8 million ""Covid-19 survivorsï¿½?in Hong Kong (including myself). Multiple research studies elsewhere have shown that we are protected against the virus for at least four to six months after infection. It seems to me that the vaccine pass scheme[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3167882/coronavirus-what-hong-kongs-vaccine-pass-scheme] could usefully have a second category added for such ""Covid-19 safeï¿½?people. Bars and restaurants could then be permitted to operate in ""post Covid-19ï¿½?mode, only admitting ""Covid-19 safeï¿½?people as verified by the Leave Home Safe app. There would be no reason for any limits on table sizes or opening hours for such restaurants and bars, and this could be the lifeline the food and beverage industry so desperately needs to tide them over until the central government has caught up with the rest of the world. I fear that this idea would be too radical for our administrators, but I live in hope that they will see the light.

The Star Ferry is a historic emblem of Hong Kongâs waterfront and holds significant value for many who have lived here. Donât let Star Ferry fail. Our government is partly responsible for the economic collapse of many companies due to its stringent Covid-19 policies. They need to start bailing out Hong Kong. If other economies can print money and survive, Hong Kong too can print money, issue debt and survive. Rishi Teckchandani, Mid-Levels Some private clubs have shut down temporarily in the battle against Covid-19 but continue to take their monthly dues in full. Why are we being charged the full monthly membership fees when none of the facilities is open? At best, we should not be charged and at worst, the fees should be reduced. Many of us run businesses and we still have to provide goods or services to our clients so that we can generate income and support our families and staff. We donât have the luxury of sending an email to our clients to tell them that we are closed and cannot serve them but will continue to debit their bank accounts as usual. Deepak Mirchandani, Jardine's Lookout Creativity is lacking in the government. In response to the pandemicâs widespread devastation in 2020, Hong Kong leaders had a real flash of inspiration; their plan to cover up to 50 per cent[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3168734/hong-kong-industry-chiefs-call-new-round-wage] of workersï¿½?salaries, capped at HK$9,000 (US$1,150) a month for each company, was brilliant. It was the kind of creativity that we needed then and which we need now. This successful idea was locally grown, but now we appear bereft of the opportunity to think for ourselves. Hong Kong people got behind the governmentâs effort to support the business community and its employees, and after six months we were able to breathe again as the pandemic receded. But the lesson has been forgotten. Instead of supporting businesses and workers, the government is giving us a handout[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3169510/some-hongkongers-will-receive-first-half-new-batch] which will be modestly helpful for perhaps a month or so but there will be no follow-through.

59,0,Shanghai Disney Resort To Close Over Covid Wave -- WSJ,524 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"China reported 1,656 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases on Saturday, health authorities said, compared with about 70 cases at the beginning of the month. Meanwhile, mainland China reported its first deaths from Covid-19 in more than a year on Saturday as the country battles a surge of Omicron infections. Two patients died of Covid-19 in the northeastern province of Jilin, which has been hard hit by the Omicron wave, China's National Health Commission said. The deaths, both of which occurred March 18, are the nation's first recorded fatalities since Jan. 26, 2021. Earlier in the week, Chinese health authorities barred Jilin's 24 million residents from leaving the province, the first time such restrictions have been imposed on an entire province since Hubei province, home to the city of Wuhan, was locked down at the start of the pandemic. China -- the world's most populous country -- has reported fewer than 5,000 deaths from the coronavirus since the pandemic began in 2020. It has kept infections and death counts low through costly and laborious measures including tight border controls, targeted lockdowns, mass testing and digital surveillance.  Walt Disney Co., which is a minority owner in the Chinese resort, said that its theme parks and resorts generated record income in its fiscal first quarter, signaling that the worst of the damage the company suffered from the coronavirus pandemic may be behind it. Shanghai Disneyland, which first opened in 2016, was the first Disney park to close as the coronavirus pandemic spread throughout China in early 2020. Disney later closed all of its parks, costing the company billions of dollars in revenue. Shanghai Disneyland reopened in May 2020. In late October, Shanghai Disneyland locked more than 30,000 visitors inside its theme park and forced them to take Covid-19 tests after one customer came back positive for the virus -- an example of the zero tolerance policy imposed by the Chinese government. China is attempting to move on from its so-called Covid-Zero lockdown measures in favor of a more precise approach to containing the virus that is less damaging to its economy. The updated measures, which include more efficient testing and shorter and more targeted quarantines, are being put to the test by the latest Omicron wave. -- Elaine Yu, Natasha Khan, Erich Schwartzel and Sha Hua contributed to this article.

275,0,Chan's faith is unrealistic; Financial secretary acknowledges impact of Omicron wave but still expects a swift recovery in Hong Kong for rest of the year,1044 words,South China Morning Post,"Our hotels would be zombies, too, were they not providing Â­quarantine facilities and a Â­smattering of staycations. Hong Kong's statistical Â­measures have always been adrift from the reality on the street, but the past two years have created a clear and cruel disconnection. How is it, for example, during what the International Monetary Fund has said is the deepest Â­recession worldwide in a century that our Official Receiver's Office has reported fewer bankruptcies in 2021 than in almost any year in the past decade? How is it that bankruptcies could surge in 2002 and 2003, around the severe acute Â­respiratory syndrome outbreak, and again after the 2008 financial Â­crisis, but flatline through the Covid-19 pandemic? Despite the disconnect, our financial secretary, who could be a leading candidate to succeed Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor as chief executive if she opts not to stand for re-selection in May, acknowledged the real-world distress being experienced by most Hong Kong families. ""The new wave of epidemic has disrupted the pace of Â­economic recovery,"" he said. The pandemic has ""dealt a heavy blow to many people, disrupting their lives and work, and seriously affected the operations of small and medium-sized enterprises"", creating a ""gloomy atmosphere"". While he remained optimistic about the medium term, he acknowledged the Omicron wave had created short-term Â­challenges. He said he was ""not optimistic"" about the first quarter of 2022, but expected recovery to resume soon thereafter, underpinning his forecast for annual growth of 2 per cent to 3.5 per cent. To achieve this, he has Â­allocated HK$170 billion to fight the pandemic and see the Â­community through the crisis. This includes HK$67.5 billion for specific antivirus efforts, such as HK$22 billion to strengthen Â­testing capacity, HK$12 billion to build quarantine facilities and HK$6 billion to buy vaccines. There will be a fresh round of HK$10,000 consumptionÂ­ vouchers, up to HK$10,000 of Â­salaries and profits tax cuts and a HK$1,000 reduction in electricity charges. But it is beyond these life-Â­support outlays that Chan's budget starts to look surreal ï¿½?because it assumes a quick return to pre-pandemic normality. In an economy starved of oxygen, he is dispensing aspirin. How can funding help tourism development, arts development, biotech start-ups, aviation, air cargo, investment promotion and the Trade Development Council and its trade fairs when zero-Covid rules shut the city off from the rest of the global economy? Even if a biotech investor wants to take advantage of one of the many incentives Chan plans to offer, he or she is unlikely to travel to Hong Kong to explore. If Chan believes Hong Kong can move within months from March's compulsory testing to bringing Covid-19 cases down to zero, opening up to the mainland and then to the rest of the world, and restoring normal air travel to Hong Kong, then I for one believe he is deluding himself. Even if the testing blitz proves to be a swimming success, the reduction of home-grown cases will be gradual, and restoration of anything resembling normal Â­economic activity is unlikely until the later part of the year. When the rest of the world is already accepting and living with the virus, Hong Kong's ""dynamic zero-Covid"" strategy would be put in immediate jeopardy when international travellers are allowed back in the city. We might be able to open to the Â­mainland, but quarantine would need to remain in place for Â­travellers Â­arriving from countries where the virus runs loose. Chan made much in his budget speech of the recovery opportunities open to Hong Kong on the mainland and in particular in the Greater Bay Area. But without opening to global markets, Hong Kong's value to both the mainland in general and the bay area in particular is severely Â­limited. To recover, Hong Kong needs to open both ways. And while ""zero Covid"" stays in place, that remains an impossibility. Perhaps the only good news in the budget is the extraordinary and unexpected budget surplus. Instead of a HK$100 billion deficit forecast a year ago, Chan now expects a surplus of HK$18.8 Â­billion, mainly because of a Â­windfall in land auction revenue and profits tax. Hong Kong is a rare and lucky economy to be confronting the pandemic with almost no debt and with reserves back up to HK$950 billion. With such reserves, the administration has been able to lift eyes beyond immediate adversities and keep faith with commitments to the Lantau Tomorrow Vision, the Lok Ma Chau Loop and the 330,000 homes to be Â­completed in the next decade. I can admire the financial Â­secretary's optimism and ability to focus on long-term challenges. But his unrealistic faith in a speedy revival after Omicron puts these long-term aims in jeopardy. The handouts may buy us a little time, but while ""zero Covid"" stays in place, that may not be enough. I pray I am wrong. We will find out soon enough.

The retail sales growth came as sales by gas stations skyrocketed by 8.9 percent amid the recent surge in gasoline prices. Excluding the spike in gas station sales, retail sales dipped by 0.3 percent. Meanwhile, the report showed sales by motor vehicle and parts dealers slumped by 1.9 percent in March after jumping by 1.5 percent in February. Excluding the pullback in auto sales, retail sales jumped by 1.1 percent in March after rising by 0.6 percent in February. Ex-auto sales were expected to increase by 1.0 percent. Along with the spike in sales by gas stations, the ex-auto sales growth reflected notably higher sales by general merchandise stores, sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument, and book stores, electronics and appliance stores and clothing and accessories stores. On the other hand, the report showed sales by non-store retailers plunged by 6.4 percent in March after tumbling by 3.5 percent in February. Closely watched core retail sales, which exclude automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, edged down by 0.1 percent in March after falling by 0.9 percent in February. ""The surge in consumer prices means that consumption fell again last month in real terms, by 0.2% or so,"" said Andrew Hunter, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics. ""While that would still leave growth over the first-quarter as a whole at close to 3.5% annualized, it provides a weak starting point for the second quarter."" He added, ""More generally, although the energy price-related hit to real incomes may unwind over the coming months, we expect slowing employment growth to keep consumption growth relatively subdued."""

Moreover, our Board of Directors will leverage their experience and broad industry relationships to further support our acquisition and evaluation process. Given our dedicated approach to the NMS industry and our significant network of relationships, we believe we are well positioned to identify leading potential acquisition targets. Our goal is to acquire a platform company in the NMS industry that has a: Â· Well-established, differentiated product portfolio with significant growth potential; Â· Product pipeline with a consistent cadence of new product rollouts; Â· Strong management team with a shared vision to create a dominant player within the NMS industry and the ability to rapidly grow the business; Â· Wide distributor network with potential for expansion; Â· Diverse and loyal user base; Â· Strong margins with visible revenue growth potential; Â· and would benefit from being publicly traded and having access to incremental growth capital. We believe that, upon completing our initial business combination, our management team will use their expertise in growing the business organically to help expand the company's operations and its sales and distribution channels following the business combination. There will also be a strong emphasis on looking to grow the company through further acquisitions and developing the company as a consolidator within its industry. We believe that there may also be opportunities to make other, peripheral acquisitions at the same time as we complete our initial business combination. We believe an acquisition by our Company can provide an efficient liquidity and capital-raising mechanism while materially reducing the risks and expenses associated with a traditional initial public offering. Furthermore, we believe VB's management team is well known to, and respected by, the founders, management, and stockholders of private medical technology companies, and that our leadership's reputations will be a competitive advantage in attracting high quality targets for our business combination. The VB management team and Board of Directors have extensive operating and transaction experience in the medical technology sector as managers, investors, acquirors and sellers. We intend to leverage this experience and our networks to identify a target company and to deliver operational and economic benefit from a business combination. 5 Competitive Differentiation Our focus is to create attractive risk adjusted returns for our stockholders, focusing on limiting technology risk by pursuing clinically proven, innovative technologies executing a differentiated operational, clinical and regulatory strategy. We believe that our team members have proven their ability to commercialize transformational technologies into market disrupting business leaders. We intend to capitalize on our ability to use the following differentiation factors to our advantage: VB's extensive ecosystem network of relationships provides us with early access to top quality deals. VB's ecosystem network includes sponsors, our investor network, key opinion leaders, global surgeon societies, innovation programs access, strategic and corporate relationships, medical institutions and the universe of NMS co-investors. Given these connections, we believe that we provide a competitive sourcing advantage and will be a preferred partner for potential targets. The niche focus of NMS provides us with an advantage over generalist healthcare investors. The deep domain expertise of our management team, detailed knowledge of market dynamics, understanding of the specific needs of the medical community and experience with the intricacies of market adoption for NMS products and technology provide us with an exceptional ability to select the leading companies in the industry. We believe that generalist healthcare investors lack the ability to understand the risks associated with this niche and to identify leading target companies. Over VB's history, VB has used its investment criteria to identify best-in-class companies, products, and technologies. VB has helped companies build strong technology platforms, fulfill clinically unmet needs, achieve successful clinical track records, mitigate regulatory risk, own significant intellectual property and regulatory portfolios and provide market development opportunities. VB is led by an all-in entrepreneur and has an effective business model. We believe VB's experience investing in and exiting portfolio companies will help provide the Company with the ability to generate positive and favorable returns. Members of our management team have also participated as financiers in several complex NMS transactions, including licensing agreements, corporate carveouts, IP acquisitions, product divestitures, asset purchase agreements, initial public offerings, company formations, debt recapitalizations, equity recapitalizations, secondary offerings, mergers, acquisitions, joint venture partnerships, debt restructurings, debt placements and private equity placements. We believe these experiences provide a distinct advantage through all stages of the investment process, from deal sourcing to portfolio company exit. We seek to leverage our team's experience arranging hundreds of partnerships with suppliers and distributors, initiating manufacturing, building and growing several sales forces, accelerating revenue growth, growing total surgeon users, building hospital distribution networks and creating market leaders within niche markets. We have a great deal of experience working with direct reps, agencies, and independent distributors. Additionally, we have often worked alongside and with large and small medical device companies. Industry Opportunity The NMS industry comprises disorders and diseases that affect human body movement involving nerves, muscle, soft tissue, and bones that lead to pain and loss of mobility. According to Orthoworld, the neuro-musculoskeletal market, also known as orthopedics, was valued at $53 billion in 2019, and saw sales growth of approximately 3.8% from 2018 to 2019. Orthopedics is the branch of medicine that deals with NMS diseases. Throughout this section, the terms orthopaedics and NMS will be used interchangeably. We believe that 100% of the population living an average life expectancy will suffer from an NMS trauma or disease. We believe that NMS diseases and disorders are the number-one cause of long-term pain, physical disability, doctor visits, worker compensation claims and employee absenteeism. 6 We believe that there are four key sectors within the NMS industry that are of interest to our Company: 1. Implantable Devices: The implantable devices segment consists of technologies that replace, repair, or support a damaged bone. These devices can be segmented into further categories based on the area of the body or type of treatment they target and offer: a. Spine: The spine market consists of implants, instruments, and surgical assistance systems to treat degenerative disc disease, herniated discs, scoliosis, vertebral fractures with pedicle screws, artificial discs, motion-preserving and kyphoplasty devices. According to Orthoworld, in 2019, global sales in the spine market amounted to $9.6 billion with almost 63% of global sales accounted for by the top four companies in the segment. Also according to Orthoworld, the spine market is growing at a rate of 3.5% per year and is projected to reach $10.0 billion in sales in 2022. b. Sports Medicine: The sports medicine market consists of equipment and implantables, including arthroscopes, visualization systems and other similar technologies for the removal of bone and soft tissue. According to Orthoworld, between 2017 and 2019, the sports medicine market grew approximately 5.5% per year and in 2019 accounted for roughly $5.9 billion in global sales. c. Trauma: The trauma market consists of implants and instruments for internal and external use, such as plates, screws, nails, pin, and external fixators, to treat traumatic injuries affecting the neuromusculoskeletal anatomy. The trauma market is the third largest segment in the orthopedic industry, and according to Orthoworld generated roughly $7.4 billion in global sales in 2019. d. Total Joint Replacement: The total joint replacement market consist"
623,0,Philippine daily stresses importance of countering disinformation,302 words,BBC Monitoring Asia Pacific,"The daily in its editorial published on 3 March cites an appeal by The Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) urging Filipinos to ""stand up for truth"" amid the ""distortion"" of history and the alarming spread of fake news that could impact the 9 May elections. ""Let us stand up for truth. Remember: Goodness without truth is pretence. Service without truth is manipulation. There can be no justice without truth. Even charity, without truth, is only sentimentalism. An election or any process that is not based on truth is but a deception and cannot be trusted,"" the CBCP noted. The Philippine Daily Inquirer, however, noted that it wil be a ""daunting challenge"" as ""there are 'weaponised' influencers and 'digital black operations' pumping out massive amounts of disinformation that are cleverly disguised as truth, making it difficult to spot or unmask them"". The paper also highlighted some steps that the public can take to curb disinformation, such as scrutinising the sources of information and checking the authors for credibility. In another editorial on 17 February, The Philippine Daily Inquirer had raised similar fears about the spread of disinformation in the country. See also: Analysis: Rising concern over election disinformation in the Philippines The Philippine Daily Inquirer is one of the most respected English-language newspapers in the country. It calls itself ""fearless in the face of repression, unflinching in its commitment to the truth for the Filipino people"".

970,1,AssaÃ­'s new frontiers,985 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"For the company, the year will be a year of accelerated expansion, driven also by the beginning of conversions of Extra Hiper stores into AssaÃ­, which allowed the group to do something unprecedented here: break down the real estate barrier in large cities. Belmiro Gomes, president of the company, says that the movement had already been happening over the last year in an organic way in cities in the interior, where there are fewer difficulties in the implementation of this wholesale model, built on plots of land averaging 50 thousand square meters. The consumer in the metropolis, on the other hand, started to look for more practical alternatives for consumption and with less impact on his routine. In this sense, the possibility of acquiring the rights to 70 Extra Hiper stores was like a saddle horse for AssaÃ­. The R$5.2 billion deal closed with the PÃ£o de AÃ§Ãºcar Group at the end of last year allowed the group to enter more central regions of the country's capitals and large cities, which Gomes considers to be ""the last frontier of atacarejo. AssaÃ­ is expected to open 50 stores this year, of which 40 were Extra Hiper addresses (the other ten are organic growth). The company's projection is to reach 300 units by 2024, a growth of 39% in relation to the 216 stores in the physical network today. At the end of the conversions horizon, the group will follow the same orientation for future openings. ""We have 48 plots of land to explore after that period, but we will keep the focus on central regions,"" the executive said. Despite being a leader in food retail, atacarejo accounted for only 20% of food sales in the country - which includes neighborhood and regional markets without flags - last year, according to a Nielsen survey. Seeing an avenue for growth, AssaÃ­'s investment is to be closer to the consumer to ensure a larger slice of this sector's revenue. If successful, the group will consolidate a new scenario for the category, attracting mainly consumers from classes A and B, which today represent 25% of the public - while class C moves 61% of sales. To occupy this space, the company needed to rethink its brand experience, which Gomes recognizes as the atacarejo's greatest weakness. ""We invested in a new store configuration, increased assortment, raised the level of service, and brought in more premium brands,"" he said, indicating that AssaÃ­'s product assortment jumped from 6,000 to 9,000 in the last five years. For the debut of the new store format for central regions, AssaÃ­ chose Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro's prime district. The space at Avenida das AmÃ©ricas has an imported wine island, a slicing area for cold cuts and a butcher shop with noble cuts, innovations for the standard until then in the chain's stores. Pleasing consumers with higher purchasing power is not new to the group, since classes A and B are the majority in AssaÃ­ stores in the interior of the country - some even have valet parking services. In large cities, this public currently only goes to atacarejo for purchases at specific times, such as festive periods, which the company wants to change. ""Our goal is to get on the radar of these consumers as a supplying purchase option,"" said Gomes. CONSOLIDATION AssaÃ­ has no intention of competing with neighborhood markets, which are its wholesale customers. The trend, in the evaluation of the executive, who has been in the market for over 30 years, is the displacement of demand in many regions for the two ends of the sector: atacarejo and proximity stores. In small cities, however, which do not support this type of operation, markets and hypermarkets will continue to play a relevant role. ""There is room for all formats, but atacarejo is not threatened in any scenario,"" said the president of AssaÃ­. The executive evaluates that, while the strengthening of e-commerce weakened the hypermarket model, the digital one does not bring risks to atacarejo. This is because the hypermarkets were sustained by the margins of sales in durable goods categories and with higher added value, in which the marketplaces have advanced with a more competitive offer. The wholesale market is strong in food retail and home products, with small margins and for which the logistics and freight costs are not worth it: ""The category has an advantage when the prices weigh on the consumer's pocket,"" he said. In the case of AssaÃ­, in his evaluation, the group would be a step ahead in atacarejo for always reinventing itself, which increases the appeal of the brand in Gomes's view. ""In ten years, we are already on our 18th store model, always designed to guarantee this adaptation to the moment of consumption."""

839,0,ROCK ICONS STRICKEN BY VACCINE DEBATE SPOTIFY PICKS JOE ROGAN OVER NEIL YOUNG IN THE LATEST SKIRMISH IN THE COVID CULTURE WARS.,1145 words,Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,"""Please act on this immediately today and keep me informed of the time schedule,"" Mr. Young wrote. It was a gutsy move. Spotify accounts for 60% of his catalogue's streaming revenue. But it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that given the choice between the author of ""Heart of Gold"" and ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" Spotify went for the gold. It didn't have to look any further than its balance sheets: Joe Rogan has an estimated 200 million monthly listeners, more than justifying the $100 million deal he signed in 2020 to stream exclusively with the company.  Neil Young has an estimated 6 million listeners per month on the site. It's very basic math as far as Spotify is concerned. The company knows that most of Mr. Young's hardcore fans don't subscribe to streaming services; they prefer catching him live or listening to his music on vinyl or CD, so streaming numbers are far from an accurate count of his immense fan base. On Thursday, Spotify began deleting Mr. Young's music from its platform, but left the door open for the rocker to return. That's going to be a long wait. Kicking Shakey to the curb instead of acknowledging that its top podcaster is often the source of vaccine misinformation detrimental to the public is a move that will eventually hurt Spotify as much as the criticism it regularly receives for reimbursing artists pennies on the dollar for the privilege of exploiting their work on its platform. Spotify has removed 40 episodes of ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" for reasons Mr. Young has complained about, but it has made no secret that it values Mr. Rogan's audience share far more than any artist's stature in the culture. These days, rock and roll is just another commodity that comes packaged with a set of values many corporations may consider as ephemeral and hard to define as cryptocurrency. Looking at Mr. Young's fight with Spotify, future historians will declare that this generation is living in a cracked mirror version of the of the 1960s and '70s. Legalized marijuana in Middle America is the first big clue that times have changed. A member of the Kennedy family who sounds like an unhinged conspiracy theorist when he compares vaccinations to Holocaust experiments is another long, strange trip. Unlike the '60s when they were counterculture heroes, rock icons like Eric Clapton and Van Morrison now sound like reactionary cranks standing on soap boxes when it comes to their pronouncements on vaccinations. What happened? Mr. Clapton claims that his critics are suffering from ""mass formation hypnosis"" possibly caused by ""subliminal messages"" on YouTube. The epic guitar god battles of the '70s have been replaced by debates about the efficacy of ivermectin versus Moderna shots. Bluesman Robert Cray backed out of the opening slot of Mr. Clapton's tour rather than be associated with the man. That's why the talk about Meat Loaf's vaccination status shortly after his death last week was so fascinating. Meat Loaf was a militant anti-vaxxer. He told the PG's pop music critic Scott Mervis that he valued his autonomy over his fear of death. ""If I die, I die"" seemed to be his response to COVID. Well, according to reports, the fatalistic rocker did die of COVID, adding to the 850,000 death toll in the U.S. alone. The virus also took such musical greats as John Prine, Wallace Roney, Ellis Marsalis and John ""Bucky"" Pizzarelli early in the pandemic. COVID and its various iterations have sickened countless other pop stars: Madonna, Wiz Khalifa, Kanye West, Billie Eilish, Gene Simmons, Drake, Ed Sheeran and Elton John, among others. Billboard keeps a running list of those who have been stricken by it. Guitar shredder and loudmouth Ted Nugent caught the virus and suffered enough to admit he thought he was going to die, but declared he still wouldn't take the vaccine. Anti-vaxxer Kid Rock's entire band caught it recently, but he's been spared so far. Steel Woods, a country rock band tried to enlist a dead icon to bolster its refusal to play in venues that require proof of vaccination. Last year, the band posted a defiant picture of Johnny Cash with the following message on social media: ""We are an American Band with American values. We aim to create music that is healing and play shows for all who want to attend. We believe in an individual's right to choose what they want to put into their body and that no one should be forced to do anything for their own good in order to go about their lives. The recent news that AEG and Live Nation venues - and specifically our show in St. Louis on 11/5 - will require vaccination or proof of negative test effective beginning of October is not something that we fully support or are willing to comply with."" But singer/songwriter Roseanne Cash was having none of it. She refused to allow her father's image to be appropriated by Steel Woods for its own purposes. ""THEIR statement, not my dad's from beyond the grave,"" Ms. Cash wrote on Twitter. ""This is an irresponsible and thoughtless misuse of the image and supposed beliefs of someone who cannot offer his own opinion. Please remove his picture from your press release. I hope you all #getvaxxed."" Through all the confusion and distraction of the moment, ""Rockin' in the Free World"" continues to echo in the distance. Ironically, it's the one Neil Young anthem that everyone from Eric Clapton and Kid Rock to the members of Crazy Horse will always claim as their own.

525,0,Back in court - UK hospitality groups take on insurers over lockdown losses,495 words,Reuters News,"Insurers have since paid out 1.3 billion pounds ($1.8 billion), according to the Financial Conduct Authority. But the ruling did not cover all policy wordings and, where it deemed claims valid, some companies are now disputing payout levels. Companies and insurers have been at loggerheads over whether business interruption policies provide cover for COVID-related losses since government lockdowns in March 2020 shuttered shops, bars and restaurants. Corbin & King, the owner of London's Wolseley and Delaunay restaurants, starts offwith a High Court trial on Monday that has been accelerated through the courts because of its interest to other policyholders. It is suing AXA for around 4.5 million pounds in a dispute that hinges in part on the scope of ""denial of access"" cover, designed to protect insured venues that are shut by public authorities on health grounds.  AXA declined to comment. Corbin & King did not respond to a request for comment. Other businesses have potentially tens of millions of pounds riding on the outcome of the case, said Mark Pring, partner at law firm Reed Smith. ""We have clients sitting there who are very interested because their wordings are either materially similar or overlap,"" he said. Three other companies are also taking on their insurers in closely-watched disputes that focus in part on the aggregation of losses: whether policies have been triggered multiple times during the pandemic and qualify for multiple payments. Slug and Lettuce owner Stonegate, Britain's largest pub group, is bringing an 845 million pound claim against Zurich, MS Amlin and Liberty Mutual, who insured 760 of its 4,500 venues. A trial, which will also examine whether government support payments can be deducted from claims, is scheduled for June. The three insurers allege their liability is limited to 17.5 million pounds, of which 14.5 million has been paid, according to court documents. They declined to comment on Friday. Multi-million pound claims have also been filed by sandwich-to-pasty chain Greggs against Zurich and by Strada and Coppa Club owner Various Eateries against Allianz.  Various Eateries and Allianz said in a joint statement they were seeking a ruling on ""a number of issues"" left unresolved by the Supreme Court. Greggs declined to comment.

285,1,Port of Fernandina positions itself for huge growth amid supply chain challenges,505 words,Jacksonville Business Journal,"Worldwide Terminals is the only operator in Fernandina. Its CEO Chris Ragucci said his company has signed agreements a Swedish shipper to import forestry products ï¿½?meranti plywood from Brazil and Southeast Asia as well as imports of Swedish sawn timber. Breakbulk cargo represented 65% of the Fernandina portâs business last year. Thus far, the 88,534 tons of breakbulk cargo is 67% better than the first quarter of 2021. The growth is such that the Nassau County Ocean Highway & Port Authority is looking to hire its first full-time Executive Director in many years later this spring [https://www-bizjournals-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/jacksonville/news/2022/04/05/fernandina-executive-director.html]. âWe were able to capture it because there are limited port facilities available in the Southeast with capacity,ï¿½?Ragucci said. âSavannah is congested. Brunswick is mostly focused on cars. Jacksonville is going for the large container ships, and most of their breakbulk is full.ï¿½? Jaxport has also witnessed breakbulk growth during the first half of its fiscal year because shippers are looking to avoid the supply chain snarls that have slowed container cargo. Nevertheless, Jaxport makes a majority of its revenue through container and auto cargo. In Fernandina, its 3,298 TEUs and 18,461 container tons during the first quarter are 7% and 59%, respectively, lower than last year. The reason, Ragucci said, is because Worldwide has focused more on breakbulk business. Worldwide is finalizing a contract with a container company that, if consummated, would bring 15,000 TEUs annually. The breakbulk contracts, as well as the potential container opportunity, are why Ragucci estimates the portâs revenues will grow 50% this year. Florida ports have championed their availability to handle additional cargo since the supply chain crunch began to be felt late last summer. While most of the discussion has focused on container cargo at larger ports like Jacksonville, Port Everglades and Port Tampa Bay; facilities that focus on breakbulk, like SeaPort Manatee [https://www-bizjournals-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/tampabay/news/2022/02/18/port-manatee-changes-its-name.html] and Port of Fernandina, are witnessing explosive growth. âA lot of it starts with the growing population in the Southeast,ï¿½?Ragucci said of the stateâs breakbulk opportunities. âForest products are not raw materials. They are manufactured materials that are going to mills (like) Georgia-Pacific, Proctor & Gamble that make consumer products. Kimberly-Clark is a big recipient of these materials. â¦These are recession-proof commodities. The factories need more wood pulp. The good infrastructure we have in Florida ports has been discovered and utilized to accommodate the growth.ï¿½?Did you find this article useful?

388,0,Packer pack slumming it in new digs,1005 words,The Australian - Online,"The move, we understand, is all part of Consolidated Press Holdings boss Guy Jallandâs ongoing austerity push at the private group. The five-year lease in the Castlereagh St building in the centre of the Harbour City, which is home to ANZâs Sydney headquarters, was signed by former CPH boss Rob Rankin amid his then (but since abandoned) grand plans for Packerâs private empire. The Packer campâs shift to more low-key premises in Macquarie House on Macquarie St also comes amid a significant reduction over recent years in the number of CPH staff that the billionaire employs. Also at play is the impact of the pandemic, which has seen many employees working Â­remotely. CPH also has a reduced need for office space now that an increasing number of Packerâs key executives, like the billionaire himself, are based offshore. Jalland lives in Monaco, while Packer has a portfolio of luxury homes around the world, including in the US (where his children live) and Argentina. Crown is facing an $8.9bn offer from New York-based investment giant Blackstone. When Packerâs influence at Crown was at its peak, there had been a plan for CPH to move its premises closer to Barangaroo, where Crown Sydney has been developed at a cost of $2.2bn, once the Liberty Place lease expired. However, the profound change in the relationship between Crown, its regulators and its 36 per cent shareholder Packer meant close corporate proximity was no longer viable or necessary. ï¿½?Empty nest Amid the turmoil that has engulfed Crown Resorts in recent years, its billionaire major shareholder James Packer hasnât touched down on Australian soil since the start of 2020. That visit was with partner Kylie Lim by his side and included an inspection of the Crown Sydney construction project. Fast forward two years and Packer has now settled on his record-breaking $72.2m purchase of an apartment taking in the 48th and 49th floors of Crownâs One Barangaroo, with Packerâs pad designed by Blainey North. Records reveal the billionaire, whose wealth was last estimated at $4bn, purchased the prestige real estate via his existing Victoria Fields Pty Ltd corporate vehicle, whose directors comprise former Crown director Mike Johnston and Catherine Davies. Packer himself has not been a director of the company since 2008. The transfer documents were signed on the private companyâs behalf by MinterEllison partner David McElhone. Packer now has a leasehold on the sky-home that expires 2120. No mortgage was required for the purchase. But thatâs a lot of money to let sit idle with the front door locked while the businessman lives offshore. Last October Packer told the Perth royal commission into Crown that he was ânot sure yetï¿½?whether heâd move into his Crown apartment. Maybe he can list it on Airbnb? ï¿½?Uncertain bid Meantime, Crown Resortsï¿½?suitor Blackstone has yet to finish the second phase of its due diligence into the casino groupâs operations. So-called phase one of the process was completed by mid-January, when Crown told the market it would recommend a binding $13.10-a-share offer from Blackstone ï¿½?should one be forthcoming and if no higher bid lobs. Since then, so-called second phase of Blackstoneâs due diligence has been under way, along with negotiations over the terms of an implementation agreement, which are continuing. But letâs remember that the James Carnegie-led local arm of Blackstone does not have exclusive access to Crown, with former suitors Oaktree and Star Entertainment, and possibly others, still potential bidders. Blackstone already has 10 per cent of Crown, which it bought from Melco at $8.15 a share in April 2020. Packer had the year before sold that stake to Melco, led by his friend and former business partner Lawrence Ho, for a much greater $13 a share. Blackstoneâs now $13.10-a-share proposal is worth about $3.2bn to Packer and clears the psychologically important threshold of $13 at which he sold to Ho. Blackstone, for its part, has created yet another vehicle to facilitate its proposal, SS Silver Finco Pty Ltd, which sits alongside at least three others it has created for the deal. But the longer any deal takes, the further Crown moves away from the tumult of recent years and in the direction of the casino groupâs better prospects for the future under chief Steve McCann and new chair Ziggy Switkowski. We hear there are some in the Crown camp who think $13.10 might not be enough. ï¿½?Differing tastes Still in the realm of the super rich, it appears that billionaire heiress Heloise Pratt and Boost Juice millionaire Janine Allis canât quite see eye-to-eye. At least not when it comes to the highly subjective matter of design. Interior design to be more accurate. Mid-last year Pratt threw down $22m (with the assistance of a mortgage to ANZ) to secure Allis and her husband Jeff Allisâs near-new Toorak mansion, located, by the way, diagonally opposite retail billionaire Solly Lewâs home base. The juice entrepreneurs paid $11m for the block in 2016 and set about building a modern masterpiece with all the bells and whistles. But eight months on from settlement, Pratt has a major internal renovation up and running on her new buy under the watchful eye of Melbourne-based interior design firm KDPO. Seems thereâs no accounting for taste. Guy Jalland James Packer James Carnegie Heloise Pratt, Janine Allis"

429,1,Centre plans to pare Life Insurance Corporation valuation,527 words,The Telegraph,"The reduction in valuation will benefit many policy holders who have opened demat accounts explicitly for the float. The government wants to ensure that these first-timers are not disappointed, reports said. Apart from finalising its results of the last fiscal, the LIC board is likely to discuss the filing of a revised public offer document, which would indicate dilution of the government stake to 7 per cent. In the present draft red herring prospectus, the government proposes to dilute 5 per cent stake in the insurance behemoth through the sale of 31.6 crore shares to collect Rs 63,000 crore. A portion of IPO would be reserved for anchor investors and up to 10 per cent of the issue size for policyholders. With equity market volatility easing slightly, the government plans to launch the IPO either in the last week of April or in May. The government has time till May 12 to launch the IPO without filing fresh papers with the market regulator. The public offer was initially expected to be completed by the end of March. The government was forced to revisit the plan because the market cooled down and displayed greater volatility following the Ukraine war. LICâs embedded value was set at about Rs 5.4 lakh crore as of September 30, 2021 by international actuarial firm Milliman Advisors. Although DRHP does not disclose the market valuation of LIC, as per industry standards it would about 3 times the embedded value. According to the insurerâs website, net profit rose to Rs 235 crore in the third quarter against a meagre Rs 94 lakh in the same period last year. Similarly, net profit for the nine months period ended December surged to Rs 1,643 crore from Rs 7 crore a year ago. The sharp jump in profit is largely due to the change in its surplus distribution plan. LIC had earlier said it would like to retain some stake in IDBI Bank so that the insurer continues to reap the benefits of the bancassurance channel. The Centre plans to sell its stake in the bank. Meanwhile, a majority of individuals want insurance companies to restart sending them physical copies of their insurance documents along with digital format as Covid-19 cases have ebbed, according to a survey. Almost 88 per cent of the respondents prefer to have a physical copy of their insurance document as insurance companies may demand it at the time of a claim, according to the survey of around 5,000 respondents across age groups and cities, reports PTI."

449,1,Framespace expansion to create 150 new Longford roles,412 words,RTE.ie,"The refurbished former Cameron Willis engineering plant in the town will enable the company to deliver 550 residential units built offsite each year. With the new staff to be added in the coming three years, the business is aiming to double its production so that it is delivering 1,100 homes by 2025. ""We all know Ireland has a housing crisis and offsite housing provides a solution that will help accelerate delivery of new homes as its adoption increases,"" Declan Murtagh, CEO of Framespace Solutions, said. ""We are proud to be opening the factory here in Longford today.""

The expansion will come as a boost to Longford town which has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. The company is being supported in its development by Enterprise Ireland and Longford's Local Enterprise Office. ""Enterprise Ireland recently launched the 'Built To Innovate' campaign, which is an initiative under the Governmentâs Housing For All plan,"" said Leo Clancy, CEO of Enterprise Ireland.

Buildings of up to seven stories can be built using the system, which lowers the duration of onsite construction by up to 40% compared to traditional building methods. The company says it has a strong pipeline of projects, including a partnership with Tetrarch Homes, and is seeking to work with local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies.

980,0,"Hot, cross pavement bunny? Check the holiday trading rules",759 words,The New Zealand Herald,"There are some exceptions. There are three types of shops that can continue trading: those that open with conditions and meet certain conditions; those that fall within an area exemption such as travel resorts in TaupÅ and Queenstown; and those that can open on Easter Sunday because their local respective council has adopted a trading policy. Specifically, small grocery shops are good to go if the only things that are for sale include food, household and personal items. Same goes for service stations, souvenir stores, restaurants, and cafes. Shops providing services such as hairdressers can open, provided no products are sold. Pharmacies and real estate agencies can open without any conditions and interestingly real estate doesnât fit within the definition of goods as defined in the Act. Garden centres can open but they must be closed on Easter Sunday and the sole principal business must be the supply of plants. Occupiers of shops found in breach of the rules may be liable for a fine of up to $1000. Trading restrictions donât extend to online services. Under the Sale of Liquor Act, liquor canât be sold or supplied at off-licences or establishments with tavern licences on Good Friday, Easter Sunday, Christmas Day, or before 1pm on Anzac Day. Selling alcohol is prohibited unless itâs accompanied with a meal. In other words, you can visit a venue with a tavern licence âfor the purpose of diningï¿½? Restaurant licences are excluded and are free to sell you a wine without food. Trains, planes and ferries have special licences that are excluded from the restrictions, so too are strip clubs, and any club that sells alcohol. Hotel bars are free to serve those at the hotel ï¿½?as âany person who is for the time being living on the premisesï¿½?is excluded from the restrictions. The patchwork application of the Sale of Liquor Act has received criticism, and itâs of little surprise the Law Commission is reviewing it. A report is due in April. Why no brunch?So, I had a Saturday window of securing my beloved bottle of Jam Shed shiraz at New World, but why, if cafes and restaurants could open, was it so hard to get my millennial brunch fix? The positive spin is that retailers are aware of the demands of capitalism, and so it seems only fair that employees deserve a paid day of leave, like all nine-to-fivers. Amendments were made to the Shop Trading Hours Act 1990 in 2016, which allowed for employees to refuse to work on Easter Sunday without any repercussions or excuse. Meaning, employers mightnât have the staff availability to open. But a realist argument comes down to cost-benefit analysis. Under the Holidays Act, if a person is to work on a public holiday theyâll be paid time and a half, and may get an alternative day off. While surcharges may be introduced to offset the cost of paying staff higher wages, it may not be worth the financial headache for employers. Like most underdog situations, itâs usually the most vulnerable workers ï¿½?those on casual contracts ï¿½?who might be strategically rostered off and have to literally pay the price. For me and other nine-to-fivers, having to prepare my own avocado on toast at home ï¿½?heaven forbid ï¿½?seemed a small price to pay to enjoy a break from the daily grind. For small business owners and the hospitality industry, public holidays may be deemed to be another kick to the guts especially after bearing the brunt of the effects of Covid-19. The rules are complex, increasingly bureaucratic, and itâs particularly fascinating that we are slaves to these religious-holiday rules despite New Zealand being a secular state. Do things need to change? Like the patchwork of rules that dominate the public holiday framework, it will be a headache for any political party that decides to do so."
546,0,These Are the Top Israeli Restaurants in New York Right Now,2064 words,Haaretz,"Aboav is secular but hails from a long line of religious Jews from Safed. The last place he worked at in Tel Aviv was the now defunct eatery Pushkin, where he was a sous-chef. âIt was the most expensive restaurant in Tel Aviv[https://www-haaretz-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/israel-news/travel/EXT.premium-best-restaurants-bars-eat-drink-tel-aviv-you-must-try-1.7210497],ï¿½?he recalls. Before that he worked as a chef in Rocca, in Herzliya Pituah, a place popular among celebs. But he always dreamed of making it in New York, Aboav says. He realized his dream ten years ago when he met Einat Admony, the chef and owner of Balaboosta in Manhattan. âShe was like a mother to me. Opened doors and introduced me to the right people,ï¿½?Aboav recounts. Actually, Aboav moved to Miami and opened 9BEACH with Itay Sacish. âIt was a huge joint, 350 seats. We invested more than $3 million,ï¿½?Aboav says. âThey built a hotel around us, there were renovations, and we had problems with the city council and had to close after ten months. I had no choice, I had to survive.ï¿½?After that he engaged in exclusive closed-list parties for the Miami millionaires in their homes or on their yachts, but then looked for something more stable, and wound up working at a kosher place, he relates. Yet he continued to dream of New York and in creating RothschildTLV, teamed up with the owner of a building and a storefront. âWe did some repairs, trained staff and after some delays due to red tape, prepared for opening night. Then COVID-19[https://www-haaretz-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/us-news/.premium-israeli-restaurateurs-in-n-y-c-say-times-are-tough-but-not-as-bad-as-back-home-1.9084530] struck.ï¿½?Everything stopped. They opened gradually and relied on deliveries, and come the day that they could open fully, the business took off. âMost of our customers are from out of town, living in religious areas, and some of them travel a couple of hours to get here,ï¿½?Aboav says. He points out that in contrast with the norm in Israel, American members of the ultra-orthodox community work. âGoing out to eat is their main form of entertainment so they are willing to spend big,ï¿½?he adds. Among the dishes served at RothschildTLV you can find âHoly Ravioliï¿½?stuffed with beef cheek, chestnuts, and wild mushrooms, served with âcorn cream,ï¿½?a concept Aboav learned at Pushkin. One of the desserts at RothschildTLV is called âBreakfast in Bedï¿½?which looks like a fried egg but consists of panna cota, coconut and mango. There are also bacon-shaped cookies. Bagels and pandemic Another restaurant is also a child of the pandemic: Accent, near the Israeli consulate in New York, run by the couple Shlomo Bador and Hilit Atia, who serve Mediterranean dishes. Possibly the best is the âJerusalem Eggplant,ï¿½?charred and fried eggplant with mango pickle (amba), tahini, and other dips. Other delicious dishes include the Moroccan Fish and the schnitzel. Bador and Atia arrived in New York[https://www-haaretz-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/us-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-best-israeli-eatery-in-nyc-comes-from-this-gifted-non-israeli-chef-1.10508701] seven years ago and have three children. At first he worked as a locksmith, but as soon as they could, the couple opened a bagel shop that began well, but the pandemic forced them to close up almost immediately.Neither the customers nor the employees turned up, they say. âThen a miracle happened. Someone from the National Guard called and asked for meals for 150 soldiers who were called up to back up the security across town. They found us online. Truth is, it was fun. We cooked and enjoyed ourselves. Once the contract with the National Guard wrapped up, we thought, this was so great, letâs open a restaurant. But we wouldnât have survived without the government support we received.ï¿½?Middle Eastern food of a different kind Nir Sarig had been a sous chef at Mint Kitchen, Erez Komarovskyâs restaurant near New York University. When Komarovsky would travel to Israel, Sarig would take charge of the restaurant. Mint Kitchen closed because of the pandemic and Sarig launched a new venture, Eti, in the Essex market on the Lower East Side. Eti started off as a bakery and wine bar, but evolved into a contemporary Middle Eastern eatery. âI tried to blend as many flavors and dishes from the region as I could, ones that New Yorkers are less familiar with,ï¿½?Sarig says. âI wanted to offer a different kind of Middle Eastern experience ï¿½?not just baba ganoush, falafel or shawarma. I wanted to serve Morrocan, Tunisian and Bedouin dishes, but done differently. I served shishbarak stuffed with olive labneh, mussels in harissa and coconut milk, and Moroccan eggplant salad with preserved mussels.ï¿½?He is presently searching for a new establishment in Lower Manhattan. Several Israeli restaurants in New York that had been doing very well in the last decade closed when the pandemic hit. But some, such as 19 Cleveland, 12 Chairs CafÃ© and Shoo Shoo, hung on. Eyal Henâs 19 Cleveland even opened an ice cream parlor next door in the depths of winter. Cobi Levyâs Lola Taverna is one of Sohoâs most popular. Dagon Restaurant on the Upper West Side is a great success. Breads Bakery, which hasnât shut at all during the pandemic, boasts long lines of queueing customers, and the owner Gadi Peleg is planning a new bakery-cafÃ© in Rockefeller Plaza. Rafi Hasid operates a pair of restaurants ï¿½?1803, which features regular New Orleans jazz, and Miriam, which has been serving Mediterranean cuisine for 16 years in Park Slope. This January, Hasid is launching a second eatery on the Upper West Side. He also runs âHomemade by Miriamï¿½?in Park Slope and in Tribeca. At Homemade, chef Alon Hadar serves Mediterranean-style health food. And Eyal Shani? What is he up to? Whilst you were quarantining, Miznon added six stores to its New York Franchise. Another new place is Sherry Herring, still in its trial period. Run by Valentino Kaplan, aside from herring, they serve sandwiches with smoked salmon, tuna fillets or salad, sprats, or anchovies. Many customers come due to mentions in the New York Times or local online noticeboards. Meanwhile in Brooklyn, television presenter Corrin Gideon and her husband Yechiel âChilyï¿½?Sorotzkin have entered the fray. An Israeli friend and partner of theirs runs Kiddush Club, their Jewish delivery service in New York. Ashkenazi and Mizrahi food is prepared for delivery out of a Brooklyn kitchen. Anyone who wants to keep the Sabbath can order cholent, chopped liver, gefilte fish, kreplach, tahini, kugel, challah and also their signature dish ï¿½?layered eggplant. âThere is no one to deliver all these Sabbath goods to the many Jews who live in New York,ï¿½?Gideon says. âWe deliver food for the Sabbath, everything included. The package includes enough food to last the entire Sabbath, from Friday morning to Saturday night. The price for a couple is $199. We offer different dishes than our Israeli range, brisket and ribs, for example.ï¿½?On a Sunday night in Brooklyn, scores of customers can be seen at Nili CafÃ©, eating hummus, drinking and listening to an Israeli quartet playing jazzy versions of beloved Israeli songs. Nili is Tomer Blechmanâs new cafÃ© , opened in 2021. He rented the space with high windows before COVID-19, hoping to replicate the success of Miss Ada, his Brooklyn restaurant. The pandemic laid waste to those plans, and since opening, the cafÃ© operates during daytime; and on Sunday evenings, offers live music. Greta is a cafÃ© run by Keren Ziv and Orit Kaufman in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Greta is Kerenâs middle name, after her grandmother. Her grandparents ran a restaurant called Lev Aviv, in Tel Avivâs Dizengoff Street, which folded at the outbreak of the War of Independence. Greta offers Israeli breakfast, shakshuka or a toasted cheese pita. Tunisian sandwiches are on offer but locals can also relish a ham and cheese sandwich. Her small cafÃ© is a dream come true for Ziv. She and Kaufman moved to the neighbourhood in 2017, and Ziv gave birth to their son Ari in late 2018. âIt gave me a different perspective on life,ï¿½?she says. The couple purchased a three-story building, renovating the five apartments inside, and the cafe is on the ground floor. They signed all the paperwork in January 2020, just before the pandemic hit New York. âThe delay actually helped us think more carefully about what we wanted,ï¿½?Ziv says. âWe just opened and already have regulars. Everything happens so quickly.ï¿½?And now for a moment of Christmas cake Roy Shvartzapel is from Karmiel and briefly played professional basketball for Maccabi Haifa. He became a star in the U.S. due to one dish: panettone, the Italian Christmas cake. After Oprah Winfrey mentioned it on her show, Shvartzapel was invited to sell his cake in one of Dominique Anselâs stores. The panettone is baked with Valrhona chocolate atop a base of slightly salted caramel. Blue Stripes, Oded Brenner (formerly of Max Brenner) and Landwerâs famed cafÃ© suffered during the pandemic. Not only was it forced to close, but some of the windows were destroyed during the riots following the murder of George Floyd. During the riots, police cars were torched on the same street of the cafÃ© so Brenner and Landwer management decided to board up the windows and wait it out. In the meantime, they have moved into wholesale, of parts of the cocoa plant not usually used in making chocolate. Blue Stripes is now operated by Alon Kasdan, who left his former role as manager and owner of CafÃ© Noi on the Upper East Side. âAfter 12 years it was time to do something fresh and I love it here, with all the students from the New School and NYU. It is a fresh start for me,ï¿½?Kasdan says. At CafÃ© Noi things have changed. Gur Haykin, a former regular, teamed up with the barista Daniel Bayer, and changed the name to Ellaâs CafÃ©, after his daughter. Given that the returns on coffee are very high, around 400% to 700%, Haykin is pleased with the deal. However, they stay open seven days a week and like everyone else, are struggling to find employees, he says. âI never thought I would work in hospitality. We got a great deal on the lease because of COIVD-19,ï¿½?Haykin adds. âThe cafÃ© has become like a kibbutz, a local place where people can speak Hebrew. We know our customers quite intimately.ï¿½?The cafÃ© will soon receive its liquor license and will serve Israeli beers but in the meantime, there are Yemeni and North African dishes. On the Lower East Side, Amir Nathan runs the cafÃ© and wine bar Sami & Susu. âWe wanted to open an all day cafÃ© like in Paris,ï¿½?he says, with an added dimension: selling labels from Israel and the West Bank, Lebanon and Italy. They are less a Mediterranean than a New York one: like the city, it has capacity for many tastes and flavors, he says. âIt was really important to us that Sami & Susu wouldnât just be another typical Israeli restaurant and that it will incorporate different Mediterranean cooking styles from Israel, Lebanon, Turkey, Greece, North Africa and include our family recipes. So we have chicken soup with kneidlach, Jordanâs mumâs ox-tongue, and my grandmotherâs stuffed cabbage,ï¿½?Nathan says. âThis coming winter we will add Jordanâs motherâs Jewish-American stew.ï¿½?This is what they do: take family recipes and improve them, based on their experience in the most popular places in town.

One report in the Guardian alleged clients of Credit Suisse included a human trafficker in the Philippines, a Hong Kong stock exchange boss jailed for bribery, a billionaire who ordered the murder of his Lebanese pop star girlfriend and executives who looted Venezuela's state oil company.

It has been operating in Azerbaijan for 12 years, steadily building up its presence and investment in employing and developing Azerbaijani nationals. The new EnerMech OGP partnership will leverage EnerMech's integrated supply, operations, maintenance and engineering solutions and specialisms alongside OGP's local expertise, technologies and effective management for delivering enhanced oil recovery. The first award is a $2 million contract to deliver engineering, lube oil flushing, accumulator charging and N2 He leak testing, to support a significant development which includes a new offshore platform and facilities designed to process up to 100,000 barrels of oil per day when it comes on-stream next year, and 300 million barrels in its lifetime. The second is a $1 million campaign to support the development of the Absheron gas-condensate field. Located offshore approximately 100km south of Baku, it is estimated to contain 350 billion cubic metres of gas, along with more than 45 million tonnes of condensate. The work scope for the partnership includes engineering, flange management, N2 He leak testing, drying and inerting of all topsides piping and vessels for this project. OGP general director Eldar Maharramov said: ""OGP was set up in Azerbaijan 17 years ago to bring new technologies, effective management and local expertise to the oil and gas industry.

Securing OGP as a JV partner has increased our capabilities with additional talent and technologies which complement our existing teams, services, and products. We will also be looking to recruit more Azerbaijani nationals as these two new projects get underway in the coming months.

786,0,News Corp. attacked by hackers with possible link to China,714 words,The Washington Post,"The cyberattack has been contained, the media giant said, and did not affect systems housing subscriber information. In a note to employees on Friday, two News Corp. executives said the attack affected ""a limited number of business email accounts and documents"" from the company's headquarters, as well as from the Dow Jones publishing company that distributes the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and News UK. Journalists were among those whose email accounts were accessed, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it. ""Even though the vast majority of our people's emails and documents were not the target of this attack activity, we take seriously any attack on our organization and our employees, including our journalists,"" wrote Chief Technology Officer David Kline and Chief Information Security Officer Billy O'Brien. They said the news organization ""will not tolerate attacks on our journalism, nor will we be deterred from our reporting, which provides readers everywhere with the news that matters."" Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in a statement that he was not familiar with the information in these reports but that China is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and has long been the victim of cyberattacks. ""Identifying the source of cyber attacks is a complex technical issue,"" Liu said. ""We hope that there can be a professional, responsible and evidence-based approach to identifying cyber-related incidents, rather than making allegations based on speculations."" Security experts and U.S. law enforcement officials say China has employed hackers for years to collect intellectual property and other sensitive data from a range of U.S. companies and institutions. The FBI has more than 2,000 open investigations focused on the ways Beijing is trying to steal information and technology, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said Tuesday in a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley, Calif. ""There is just no country that presents a broader threat to our ideas, our innovation and our economic security than China,"" Wray said. Officials in both China and the United States have warned against cyberattacks from the other as the relationship has grown fraught in recent years. Washington has long accused Beijing of cyberattacks motivated by economic espionage, as well as surveillance of political targets. Beijing says it's the victim, not the perpetrator, of cyberattacks. U.S. news organizations have reported hacks against journalists with suspected ties to China over the years. In 2015, reporters writing about the Defense Department, the White House and the CIA for The Washington Post received letters saying their personal information may have been stolen. U.S. officials said privately at the time that the hackers were with the Chinese government. In 2013, the New York Times and the Journal reported they were the targets of cyberattacks from China. China expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters in February 2020, ostensibly in retaliation for a column headline the government deemed to be racist, amid frosty U.S.-China relations. The move followed a decision by the United States a day earlier to designate five major Chinese media outlets as government entities.  News Corp. noted in its regulatory filing Friday that cyberattacks have ramped up in recent years, adding that its defenses have been made more complicated by remote work during the pandemic. It said hackers exploited a cloud-based system operated by an unnamed third party. aaron.gregg@washpost.com eva.dou@washpost.com"

933,0,Why your local Maccas could be SHUT this week - fast-food giant slashes opening hours due to staff shortages,756 words,Mail Online,"* Similarly, supermarkets are seeing reduced stock due to supply chain issues Multiple McDonald's fast food stores across Australia are set to reduce their opening hours after a high number of workers are having to isolate because of Covid.  McDonald's confirmed that some restaurants would have to open later and close earlier because of 'staff isolation requirements'. The fast food giant is the latest in a string of businesses having to scramble because of Covid disruptions with supermarkets running low on stock and rival KFC announcing they would serve up a reduced menu, both because of supply chain issues. 'We appreciate our customers' patience and understanding as we continue to prioritise health and safety during these times,' a McDonald's spokesperson said.  McDonald's in Blaxland in the Blue Mountains area of NSW usually runs 24 hours but signs posted at the store on Tuesday explained that 'due to unforeseen circumstances trading hours are currently 6am to 11pm'. Meanwhile supermarket giant Coles has introduced buying limits at stores across the country after supermarkets had their shelves cleared across parts of Queensland, NSW and Victoria because of the combination of panic-buying and supply-chain issues. But farmers have called for calm saying there is plenty of fresh produce in the field and that the competition watchdog should monitor the situation. NSW Farmers President James Jackson said there were good production levels of fresh food despite the challenging weather of the past few months and urged shoppers not to panic buy. 'Our growers are sending plenty of produce down to the Sydney Markets, and we're working on making sure farm businesses can continue to harvest these crops,' Mr Jackson said. While farmers have reported opportunistic price hikes amongst some retailers. 'Sadly, we've seen some companies and individuals use the scarcity of tests and images of empty shelves as an opportunity to lift their prices, so we would ask the ACCC to keep a close eye on retailers to make sure they don't bump up prices above any movements in the farm gate price of fresh fruit and vegetables.' NSW Farmers has also called on state and federal governments and the big supermarkets to urgently look at ways to supply farmers with Rapid Antigen Tests so they can keep the food chain supplied. 'The big challenge for the agricultural sector now is sick workers and a lack of access to Rapid Antigen Tests, which are combining to create these broader supply chain issues you hear about,' said the NSW Farmers boss. 'We've seen some positive announcements, but the fact remains that the fresh food we enjoy is grown on Australian farms, and if our farmers can't get it out of their fields it won't make it to supermarket shelves,' Mr Jackson said. New guidelines being considered by national cabinet will see a return of fruit and vegetables to the supermarket shelves within the week according to the Australian Fresh Produce Alliance. The group's chief executive Michael Rogers had warned that fruit and vegetables could rot in the fields because of the supply chain issues and a shortage of workers due to COVID-19. The guidelines issued by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee change the definition of close contacts for those exposed to COVID-19 working in critical food and grocery production, manufacturing, logistics and distribution facilities 'The measures that change requirements for close contacts which have been announced are very welcome because they put capacity back in the system, but it's still going to be a very tight situation,' Mr Rogers told AAP on Monday. Mr Rogers said he expects supermarket shelves will begin to fill over the next week as a result of the changes. The peak industry body for the Australian vegetable and potato industries also continues to feel the impact of COVID-19. In a statement to AAP the CEO Michael Coote has also called for the guidelines to be adopted. 'Our growers are still feeling pressure from worker shortages of pickers and packers in the country, and the additional pressure of isolation is putting further pressure on vegetable producers, as they struggle to find alternative staff to fill the void.'"

The annual report, filed to the Hong Kong stock exchange, did not provide financial data for East Dawning, which was established by Yum on the mainland in 2005. The chain kicked off with about 100 restaurants nationwide located mainly at airports and train stations. But the number has fallen drastically over the years amid stiff competition. By 2012, the chain had dwindled to 30 restaurants, and by 2020 only eight outlets of the brand remained. ""Disease outbreak dealt a fatal blow[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3168563/coronavirus-cafe-de-coral-among-hong-kong] to the brand, but it has not been successful over the past decade due to stern challenges from a raft of local restaurant chains,ï¿½?said Chen Xiao, CEO of Shanghai Yacheng Culture, a consultancy dealing with marketing and branding for foreign and local companies. ""After all, the five outlets and the brand are of little value to Yumâs businesses in China.ï¿½?East Dawning, in Chinese, literally means that the east is lit up by the light of dawn. Su Shi, a poet during the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127) wrote in his poem the Red Cliffs that a group of friends were so obsessed with a dinner party on a boat that they did not notice the east was lit up by the light of dawn. East Dawning was the first Chinese-style fast-food brand created by Yum to tap the market potential on the mainland. It combines KFCâs business model with Chinese cuisine. The menu includes steamed pastries such as buns, and Chinese tea. The fast-food brand has been eclipsed by the rise of Chinese restaurant chains such as Da Niang Dumpling and Yangâs Dumplings which are adept at cooking Chinese food to appeal to local tastes. Chinaâs catering sector has taken a beating from the coronavirus outbreak over the past two years as lockdown measures and social distancing rules have kept customers at bay. In 2020, restaurants across the mainland reported total revenue of 3.95 trillion yuan (US$625 billion), down 15.4 per cent on the year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. In the first half of 2021, the catering industry raked in sales of 2.17 trillion yuan, up 48.6 per cent from a year ago, but virtually unchanged from the same period of 2019.  Yum China, whose other brands include Little Sheep, Huang Ji Huang and Coffii & Joy, operates more than 11,700 outlets on the mainland. It reported net profit of US$525 million in 2021, down 15 per cent from the previous year. Revenue grew 19 per cent to US$9.85 billion. Its shares trading in Hong Kong were changing hands at HK$378 (US$48.37) on Monday afternoon, having slumped 8 per cent from their initial public offering price of HK$412 in September, 2020."

To rein in cases, authorities also shut down Shanghai Disney Resort on Monday till further notice. âWhen it comes to the entire situation of epidemic control and prevention that we are facing, it is very complex and serious, and it is also a very big test for us,ï¿½?Mr Wu said at a news briefing, adding that Shanghai will stick with âdynamic clearanceï¿½? The severity of outbreak responses by Shanghaiâs compounds and residential districts varied, with some opting for lockdowns for two weeks, while others residing in sealed-off districts not being informed about the period for which they would be forced to stay home, prompting a frustrated response from users on social media. âHong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen have had three different epidemic response models,"" said a user on Chinaâs Twitter-like Weibo network. âHong Kong is the worst but will be the first to open up,ï¿½?the user by the name zangyn said in a widely-shared post. âShenzhen is the most effective, and Shanghai may be the most tiring, and even the most miserable.ï¿½?According to data from the National Health Commission for Sunday, mainland China reported a total of 1,947 new cases with symptoms and 2,384 asymptomatic cases. A day earlier, it had reported 1,656 symptomatic and 2,177 asymptomatic cases. There were no deaths reported on Sunday and the toll remained unchanged at 4,638. China, which does not classify asymptomatic cases as confirmed cases, has reported over 37,000 cases of local infections since March this year, with the overall reported cases for the pandemic reaching 132,226 cases.

420,0,Sweden to lift pandemic restrictions next week,827 words,RTE.ie,"""It's time to open Sweden up again,"" Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told a news conference. ""Looking ahead, infection rates will remain high for a while longer, but as far as we can judge, the worst consequences of the contagion are now behind us,"" she said. Fuelled by the more contagious Omicron variant, Sweden has repeatedly set newly daily case records over the past month that has strained the healthcare system, although to a lesser extent than in previous waves. Sweden stood out early in the pandemic by spurning lockdowns, mainly relying on voluntary measures focused on social distancing and good hygiene, though somewhat tighter restrictions were gradually adopted in successive waves. It has seen deaths per capita run much higher than in its Nordic neighbours but lower than most European countries that opted for lockdowns. Latest coronavirus stories[https://www.rte.ie/news/coronavirus/] Some recommendations, such as getting vaccinated and isolating at home when sick, will remain in place and they will be more restrictive for the unvaccinated, Health Minister Lena Hallengren told the news conference. Amid increasing evidence that Omicron results in less severe disease than previous variants, she added the Health Agency will also propose that the virus no longer be designated a threat to society, though it would still be closely monitored. Czech government plans to end Covid passes, easing measures for unvaccinated The Czech Republic will stop requiring Covid passes for entry to restaurants and other service or entertainment venues starting next week, opening them up to unvaccinated people, Prime Minister Petr Fiala said. The country of 10.7 million, which was hit hard by previous waves of the Covid pandemic, is seeing a record spike in coronavirus cases as the Omicron variant spreads. However, officials expect an easing of infections this month. The Health Ministry reported a record daily tally of 57,226 Covid infections on Tuesday, plus nearly 10,000 suspected re-infections But hospitalisations have not yet jumped and are well below peaks in previous waves of the pandemic. The government has sought to end some measures.

The government will also finish mandatory testing in firms and schools from 18 February. Measures requiring mask wearing indoors and limits to the number of people at public events will remain. The moves follow easing planned in other European countries. Neighbouring Austria will allow shops and restaurants to remain open longer and also ease restrictions on the unvaccinated from next week. Yesterday, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said Italy would soon announce a timetable to roll back its Covid-19 curbs. Bali to welcome first international tourist flight amid cautious reopening Indonesia's holiday island of Bali will welcome its first direct flight carrying foreign tourists for nearly two years today, but just a handful of visitors will be on board to enter strict quarantine on arrival. A Garuda Indonesia flight from Tokyo is scheduled to arrive in Bali in the afternoon, with six foreigners and six Indonesians aboard, said an official at the Bali Government Tourism Office. Though the island officially opened to visitors from China, New Zealand, Japan and a few other countries in mid-October, there have been no direct non-cargo flights since then. The six foreign tourists arriving from Tokyo were travelling using business visas since the new rules for tourists were not ready when they applied to come. Click to view image.[https://img.rasset.ie/001b22bd-614.jpg?ratio=1.78] Indonesia has said restarting international flights is intended to boost Bali's battered tourism sector, which usually accounts for 54% of its economy. Known for its surfing, temples, waterfalls and nightlife, Bali drew 6.2 million foreign visitors in 2019, the year before Covid-19 struck. The entire country recorded just 1.6 million foreign visitors last year, down 61.57% from 2020. However, Indonesia is maintaining much stricter quarantine requirements than Southeast Asian neighbours Thailand, which resumed quarantine-free entry for vaccinated visitors from Tuesday and the Philippines, which will do the same from 10 February. Vaccinated tourists to Bali must quarantine between five and seven days at hotels or on vessels offshore. Bali's slow reopening comes as Indonesia has been seeing a steady increase in Covid-19 cases, primarily driven by the Omicron variant. The country reported nearly 18,000 infections yesterday, the highest tally since August.

""No muscle in my body told me to play any version of myself in a movie. And because it scared the crap out of me, I knew I had to do it.ï¿½?Cage explained his concerns on the red carpet just outside of Austin's Paramount Theatre.

Nicolas Cage talks 'Pig' co-star, freezing with Cher during 'Moonstruck' and his go-to dinner recipe More SXSW: NBA star Earvin Johnson embraces his HIV status as his 'purpose' Gormican persuaded Cage with a letter, the actor said. ""In that letter it became clear to me that he was looking more towards a genuine interest in some of the earlier work and a celebration of that, with the elements of whatever pathos I've been through that people have or have not read about,"" said Cage. ""And so I said, 'OK, I think maybe there's something here.' On top of which I have a mantra of sorts, which is that the very thing you're afraid of is probably ï¿½?most likely as long as (it's) within reason (and) doesn't hurt yourself or someone else ï¿½?that's the very thing you should go towards, because you're probably going to learn something."" Cage said the onscreen version is quite a contrast. ""There's no version of a Nicolas Cage that doesn't want to spend time with his family. And that was the biggest schism with Tom and I when we were making a movie, which is that I'm not like that.

I spend time with my cat and my family and my wife. He goes, 'But that's not fun. I want neurotic Nick Cage.'"" Gormican co-wrote the screenplay with Kevin Etten before they'd even had contact with Cage. ""When Kevin and I were writing the script, the entire time we were just thinking, 'I think at the very least, this will make our friends laugh, and this is a movie that we'd want to see,'"" he said on the carpet. ""We didn't know him. We had never met him. He didn't know about the project. He was not signed on to it.

In the Netherlands, around 60,000 infections have been diagnosed every day, but the number of intensive care units and deaths has started to decline. The Dutch interest rate cut began before Christmas. In early January, thousands took part in anti-restriction demonstrations in the Netherlands.

""Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus,ï¿½?said Dave Wong, a vice-president at the cybersecurity company retained by NewsCorp that was formerly known as FireEye. ""We believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit Chinaâs interests.ï¿½?The announcement comes as Washington continues to raise the alarm about Chinese cyberattacks against the US ï¿½?and as Beijing continues to crack down on US news organizations operating in the country, including The Wall Street Journal.

China kicked out American reporters employed by The Journal and other US newspapers in 2020, and is considered by press freedom advocates to be one of the worldâs most oppressive countries for journalists. The cyberattack was first reported by The Journal, which said the hackers ""accessed emails and documents of some employees, including journalistsï¿½? In a quarterly report filed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, NewsCorp said it had discovered last month that it was the target of ""persistent cyberattack activityï¿½? ""The companyâs preliminary analysis indicates that foreign government involvement may be associated with this activity, and that data was taken,ï¿½?the corporate filing said. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the hack. Earlier this week, FBI Director Christopher Wray described the threat from Chinaâs government as ""more brazen, more damaging, than ever beforeï¿½? ""Here in the US, they unleash a massive, sophisticated hacking programme that is bigger than those of every other major nation combined,ï¿½?Wray said on Monday in a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in California. ""Operating from pretty much every major city in China, with a lot of funding and sophisticated tools, and often joining forces with cyber criminals, in effect, cyber mercenaries,ï¿½?he said. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The US government has linked numerous high-profile hacks to China in recent years. One, which stole the personal data of 78 million people from a health insurance company and three other firms, was described by the Justice Department in 2019 as ""one of the worst data breaches in historyï¿½? Last summer, the White House said that Beijingâs Ministry of State Security was working with a global network of contract hackers on behalf of the Chinese government. In one case last year, the US said China had hacked Microsoft servers as part of a ""massive cyber espionage operationï¿½?targeting thousands of computers and networks, ""mostly belonging to private sector victimsï¿½? The Wall Street Journal said on Friday that it remained unclear how many employees had their email accounts and documents accessed during the cyberattack. They added that ""systems housing financial and customer data, including subscriber information, werenât affectedï¿½?

298,0,"Giles Coren reviews the Bell Inn, Stilton, Cambridgeshire",1544 words,thetimes.co.uk,"I asked [https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/harry-and-meg-make-us-all-look-good-value-zh285k2tv]  in my Notebook column for some lunch recommendations in the town. I had never reviewed a restaurant in Peterborough, and nor had anyone else, ever, in the history of national newspapers, so it seemed to present too good an opportunity to miss. I donât know much about Peterborough, apart from that Roy Kinnear dressed up as a Roman centurion there in a series of adverts in the 1980s that hailed what they called âthe Peterborough Effectï¿½?and sought, one assumes, to encourage investment in the âNew Townï¿½?(as it was designated in 1967, despite already being a cathedral city) and turn it back into the bustling metropolis it had been 2,000 years before. From the look of the restaurant scene, alas, it doesnât seem to have worked. Of the âTen Best Restaurants in Peterboroughï¿½?that I found online, three were permanently closed and the other seven were not in Peterborough. Obviously, there would be nice little pubs out in the countryside, there always are. But I needed to be close to the stadium so I could drive up, park, and then eat in a defined time slot that would allow me to get to the ground and through the turnstile in time to catch every single one of the 15 or more goals we would smash past the hapless âPoshï¿½? So I put it out to tender. You replied in your hundreds below the line. Mostly with the names of places that were either permanently closed or not in Peterborough. The Oundle Tap and Kitchen in nearby Oundle, for example, generated the most recommendations and sounds excellent but is not, alas, in Peterborough. It is in nearby Oundle. Should we draw Oundle in the cup next year ï¿½?pray God ï¿½?I swear on my life I will go. Phil Harrison at least got the geographical gist when he suggested, âThe Palmerston Arms on Oundle Road, near the ground, for cobs and real ale,ï¿½?and Iâm sure itâs lovely, but even I canât squeeze 1,500 words out of a pint and a white bread sarnie (well, I can, and have, but I was aiming higher this time). He also mentioned the Woodston Chippy on the walk to the ground (depending on where you are walking from, of course) and the pies at the ground itself (warning, like others who praised them, of their ï¿½?00C heatï¿½?and attendant burns risk). But, again, chippies and pies are much of a muchness, and anyway nothing can touch the double cheeseburger at QPR from the stall on the corner between Loftus Road and Bloemfontein, which Sam, or any other Superhoop, will tell you is the best in England. Barry Shooter suggested a detour to the George at Stamford, but Iâve been there and reviewed it before, and itâs not, as its Stamford location attests, in Peterborough. And Simon Chapman told me the pizzas were fabulous at the Green Dragon in Ryhall but that is, annoyingly, in Ryhall, which is practically Nottingham. âYork Vikingï¿½?was even more defeatist (strangely, for a ferocious Norseman), with his suggestion that, âIf youâre travelling by train out of Kingâs Cross, go to Nenno on Caledonian Road. Wood-fired pizza oven.ï¿½?Others, such as Martin Royd (âTry the Stibbington Diner ï¿½?while itâs not posh London nosh, it might do you good to see how others liveï¿½? and Michael Patterson (âTry the Great Northern Hotel opposite Peterborough station: perfectly edible but probably not up to the standards youâre used toï¿½? seemed to be suggesting places designed either to reinforce any negative suspicions I might have fostered about the Petroborovian restaurant scene, or to punish me for having high expectations, which was weird. Noel McLaughlin, Stephen Burnett and others gave a big shout-out for the Haycock in Wansford, which was another fair detour from the town, and while Knowit2âs tip that âCatherine of Aragon is interred at Peterborough Abbeyï¿½?was very helpful, I fear that the old Spanish bird would have made for a somewhat chewy lunch. Likewise, GiantHaystacksï¿½?tip that, âIf you get a flat tyre in the car park I can recommend the local Kwik Fit.ï¿½?Other suggestions included the Gurkha Durbaar (but Sam wonât eat a curry for lunch), the Cherry House at Werrington and the Falcon at Fotheringhay (detours, detours) and when I pleaded, pleaded, for somewhere IN PETERBOROUGH, I was repeatedly offered CÃ´te in the cathedral precinct and that other great example of temple catering, the Caroline Hand Executive Suite at Peterborough FC, where Â£54, I was reliably informed, would buy me my lunch, match ticket (âin padded seatingï¿½?, half-time tea and cakes and programme. Except Sam and I already had our tickets, in the away end, right in the front row in the hope of scoring a shirt thrown by Charlie Austin, Chris Willock or, pray God, âUncleï¿½?Albert Adomah himself. For we are the pride of west London, the blue and the white, we hate Cardiff City and Chelsea are shite, and we just wanted a nice little pre-match scoff (with my old pal Toby and his three sons) that I could feasibly put on expenses. So when a Mr Kim Swithinbank (among others) suggested the Bell Inn at Stilton and said it was âen routeï¿½?from London, I was in. I already love two Bells (the ones at Langford and Sapperton, both in Gloucestershire) and as for its being in Stilton, well, at least there would be cheese. And I cannot fault the location, at least from the point of view of matchday convenience. Because from the looming of the Bell on my sat-nav as we roared up the A1(M), it was clear that it was situated almost literally on the motorway ï¿½?possibly too close, one might say, for anything other than a London football fanâs pre-Peterborough pitstop. We came off at the junction, switched back 180 degrees and dawdled along a road adjacent to the big one, through newish housing, until the road widened and widened (and widened) to run through a sweet, empty, old village with no parking restrictions at all. Literally, none. Iâve not seen the like since the late 1970s. We pulled up (for free and without having to reverse) outside a pretty 18th-century coaching inn (correction, 15th-century coaching inn, just checked, bloody hell) with a giant sign featuring a bell and the word âStiltonï¿½? which swung back and forth in the wind with a loud âhee-haw, hee-hawï¿½?that rang ominously round the otherwise silent street and reminded me of the opening scenes of Once Upon a Time in the West . Inside, though, there was warmth and bustle. I was glad Iâd asked for a table in the bar rather than the theoretically smarter ârestaurantï¿½?(always best for vibes), our hostess was delightful, and the light, fragrant Foolâs Nook (Â£3.55) was an excellent driving beer (one pint only, with food, leave me alone ï¿½?I take the 15th-century approach when away from home, that the beer is safer than the water). As for that food, if you stick to the delicious halloumi fries (not cheap at Â£6 for 4 wee batons) youâll do very well. Straying into more exotic territory, however, one encounters the âHoney and mustard glazed sausagesï¿½? which is a misleading plural because what your Â£6 in fact gets you is one ordinary breakfast banger cut into four chunks in a bowl with cocktail sticks. Then thereâs the cod cheek scampi (Â£9) and a fried duck breast (Â£20) that looked okay and a Â£16 burger that was somewhat misshapen and carbonised but Sam managed to swallow some of, and a plate of those rectangular âFish & chipsï¿½?(Â£17) that you do see in pubs sometimes, and then the âStilton friesï¿½?(Â£6), which was a nice idea that I think could work well with lovely crispy fries, cut from real potatoes, deep-fried to order and served hot. But, look, the main thing is that, thanks to the Bellâs confident pricing, I was able to put more than Â£200 into the local economy, and get to the game in good time to see us thrashed 2-0 and dumped unceremoniously out of the cup. Which was not at all, as I said at the top of this piece, what I had come to Peterborough to watch us do. On the plus side, though, as the Rangers faithful sang, âWe lost 2-0, who gives a f***? Weâre QPR, weâre going up!ï¿½?And, possibly from the gastronomic hardcore, the always uplifting, âWe get to go home, you have to stay hereâ¦ï¿½?The Bell Inn Stilton, Cambridgeshire (01733 241066; thebellstilton.co.uk thebellstilton.co.uk ) Location 10 Service 8 Cooking 3 Score 7"
672,1,"Growthpoint Properties unveils new name for co-investment, co-management business",1086 words,InPR,"Growthpoint began the groundwork for Growthpoint Investment Partners in 2014, when it identified internationalisation, local portfolio optimisation, trading and development, and co-investment as its core strategies. Before this, Growthpoint had favoured sole-ownership investments in SA almost exclusively, and in response it created a new platform to deliver its co-investment, co-management strategy. It is this platform, previously labelled the âfunds management businessï¿½? that has been rebranded Growthpoint Investment Partners, and will continue to further diversify Growthpointâs assets by harnessing new opportunities through co-investment in order to create sustainable value for Growthpointâs stakeholders and investment partners. Its new tactic as an investment partner ï¿½?leveraging the management skills that have grown Growthpoint into a leading international property company ï¿½?has proven a defensive growth strategy in the low-growth capital-constrained South African market, and led to a co-investment approach that has quickly gained traction. From a zero-base in 2018, Growthpoint Investment Partners has already topped its target R15bn of assets under management by 2023. Now, it is aiming to double this in the next five years. The growth of Growthpoint Investment Partners is adding meaningful depth to the real estate market by creating access to alternative opportunities in the unlisted and co-invested environment for the broader investment community, its investment partners as well as Growthpoint.  Norbert Sasse, Growthpoint Group CEO, says the renaming of this Growthpoint business is a significant milestone. âThe time has come to create a formal identity for this robust partnership platform. Growthpoint Investment Partners has gained strong momentum and is successfully attracting co-investment capital. It delivers one of our core strategies, but has a distinctive investment model different from Growthpoint Propertiesï¿½? and we wanted to reflect this in its new name.ï¿½?Growthpoint Investment Partnersï¿½?investment model starts with Growthpoint backing each investment with an anchor stake of around 20%. Co-investors then contribute up to 80% of the capital to the opportunity. Each investment has gearing of approximately 40%. The ability to scale each opportunity is a key consideration. So too is differentiating the assets from Growthpointâs core SA portfolio in the office, retail and industrial property sectors. Since 2018 it has launched three unlisted investments in specialist alternative real estate asset classes: African (ex. SA) income-producing commercial real estate, SA healthcare property, and SA student accommodation. Growthpoint is a cornerstone investor in these investments and plays a management role. Each has introduced new co-investment opportunities that leverage Growthpointâs management and capital strengths. All have related positive long-term socio-economic impacts and enjoy access to Growthpointâs excellent governance oversight frameworks, and extensive dedicated environmental, corporate social investment and sustainability resources. Through Growthpoint, the Growthpoint Investment Partners platform affords its investments REIT status. However, the unlisted investments provide exposure to direct real estate that tends to be driven by long-term fundamentals rather than listed real estate volatility driven by short-term sentiment. âThe growth and scale of Growthpoint Investment Partners to date has established it as a leading investment partner in alternative real estate markets. Its new name not only reflects its significance for Growthpoint and its success in unlocking new real estate co-investment opportunities with its investment partners, but also its positive impacts and exciting prospects for considerable future growth,ï¿½?says Sasse. GROWTHPOINT INVESTMENT PARTNERSï¿½?ALTERNATIVE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS: Growthpoint Healthcare REIT launched in 2018 as SAâs first unlisted REIT focused exclusively on healthcare property investment. Its assets have grown to R3.4bn. It has raised over R1.3bn of co-investor funding, with investment partners including the IFC, Kagiso Capital, Sentinel Pension Fund, and Vulindlela Holdings. The calibre of its investors is an endorsement of its robust ESG credentials. Growthpoint has a 55.9% share in Growthpoint Healthcare REIT, which invests exclusively in healthcare property assets in SA with a mandate to acquire and develop acute, day and specialist hospitals, as well as laboratories and biotechnology manufacturing and warehousing facilities. It has a R5bn pipeline of acquisitions and developments. The aim is to scale Growthpoint Healthcare REIT to some R10bn in assets for a stock exchange listing. Growthpoint Student Accommodation REIT launched in December 2021 to become SAâs first unlisted purpose-built student accommodation REIT. It has a R2bn portfolio of seven assets with 4,979 beds, which has a two-year rental underpin to mitigate against short-term impacts of Covid-19 and an immediate three-development growth pipeline. Its first close attracted partner capital commitments of R1.1bn, and around R1.4bn in equity including Growthpointâs co-investment of R240m representing 16% cornerstone investment and co-investor Feenstra Groupâs 11%. It has attracted significant commitments from preeminent investment holding companies. By investing in and developing new accommodation specifically for university students, Growthpoint Student Accommodation REIT helps to improve education outcomes and create economic opportunities, making it an impact investment. It will grow towards R12bn in assets and a stock exchange listing within seven years. Lango Real Estate (formerly Growthpoint Investec African Properties) commenced in 2018. Langoâs assets have since grown to USD601m. It has raised over USD320m in partner funding from notable South African and international institutional investors and has emerged as a leader in the African real estate market. Growthpoint has a 16% shareholding in Lango, with a co-investment of USD50m. Lango which invests in prime commercial real estate assets in key gateway cities across the African continent. It has 11 income-generating commercial properties in Ghana, Nigeria, Zambia and land holdings in Anglo. It strives to act as a catalyst for impact across the continent. Lango is currently in a capital raising period, which it intends to use mainly to acquire a pipeline of assets, particularly in Nairobi, Kenya. It is positioned for a stock exchange listing in the medium term. ***** SeeNews does not endorse in any way, the views, opinions or recommendations expressed above.

""We know that all help is being assured to the stranded Indians and the Indian Embassy is planning to airlift Indians as soon as possible by bringing the stranded Indians in Ukraine to the border countries of Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and we hope our kid too comes back soon,"" said Ramesh Chandra. Amit Mishra, the elder son of Prabhashankar Mishra from Kathauli village who went to study MBBS in Ukraine from Uruva block of Meja tehsil, expressed concern about his father's health. In a message he informed that in the initial days when the situation was so bad, the university did not give permission to go home. Tushar Pandey and Anurag Singh of Prayagraj had come home before the situation worsened but their friends Arpit Singh, Dikshant Srivastava, Bhuvan Singh, Amit Mishra and Anmol Ahuja are still stuck there.

436,0,End of era: Iconic beachside pavilion to be demolished,542 words,Courier Mailï¿½?- âOnline,"The shock demolition plan and closure of the restaurant at the end of February was discussed when restaurant owners Oli and Sandra Thomson met with a council officer last week. Mr Thomson said he had to cancel dozens of bookings for the prestigious beachside function rooms. The council said its officers had told Mr Thomson last year his occupancy would end in February and he should not have made any advance bookings beyond that date. âIt would have been our fifth birthday on February 15 but now I have no clue as to what our plans will be,ï¿½?Mr Thomson said. âOur priority is finding jobs for our staff. We have invested everything we had in this business and now, at 44, I will have to go and find another job.ï¿½?Some of the customers he had to turn away were Redcliffe residents Anton Cavalli, who has battled cancer, and his fiancee Bec, who met at the pavilion and were to hold their wedding night dinner there. Moreton Bay Regional Council said the building was too expensive to maintain to a safe standard and disputed Mr Thomsonâs claims that he had not been warned about the demolition. A council officer said the business had used polystyrene in its walls and there were hygiene concerns. Mr Thomson said the two claims were âcategorically untrueï¿½? Council chief executive Greg Chemello said the ânominalï¿½?rent collected and the high maintenance costs of the buildings did not make the pavilion a viable asset for the council to maintain. He said the council had made the difficult decision to demolish the pavilion to reinvigorate the area and open up the space to the community for a variety of purposes. He also said Mr Thomson was advised on February 25, 2021 of the decision not to renew the lease when it expired on November 27. âCouncil commissioned independent consultants to complete structural inspections of the complex,ï¿½?Mr Chemello said. âThese investigations found extensive building defects due to age, construction issues and proximity to the foreshore, confirming the buildings are nearing their end of life and experiencing an accelerated rate of deterioration, leading to safety concerns.ï¿½?Plans to make the site safe and return it to a public space are underway and a development application for the demolition will be in February. Mr Chemello said the council had refrained from releasing details of the demolition so Mr Thomson could continue to trade over Christmas but further lease extensions were out of the question. Council officers will meet with Mr Thomson tomorrow to discuss the closure of the venue. This original 1937 Art Deco Bathing Pavilion is the only venue of its kind with direct access to the beach in the Brisbane area. It offered meals of local, fresh, seasonal produce for breakfast, lunch, dinner and takeaway."
968,1,"Exports of Indian dairy products top $500-million mark, hit eight-year high",566 words,BusinessLine Online,"The surge in exports is driven by robust demand for both commodity and value-added dairy products, coupled with a rise in global prices. Trade sources said both co-operatives and private players have seen good growth in exports of dairy products during the year. Commodity exports India, the largest milk producer in the world, had previously clocked a record dairy shipment of $727 million in FY14, when the global prices ruled higher.  Click to view image[https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/7bhdle/article65317945.ece/alternates/FREE_660/image%20%2812%29.jfif]  RS Sodhi, Managing Director, Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) which sells products under Amul brand, said the growth has come about due to commodity exports such as skimmed milk powder (SMP), although branded products witnessed the usual annual growth of 15-20 per cent. Amul has shipped out around 35,000 tonnes of SMP during the year. The export turnover of the countryâs largest co-operative during FY22 registered a 300 per cent growth at around ï¿½?,450 crore compared with ï¿½?20 crore in the previous year. âRising feed costs and fertiliser shortage is seen impacting milk production in dairy-rich countries, driving demand for Indian dairy products. We were never competitive in the dairy fats segment, but now the global fat market is about 20 per cent higher than India,ï¿½?Sodhi said. Trade sources said unfavourable weather conditions in New Zealand and Australia have affected milk production in these milk surplus countries, resulting in historic high international commodity prices. This has helped Indian entities export products such as SMP, butter and whole milk powder, among others, to dairy deficit countries. The US, Bangladesh, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia are among the larger buyers of Indian dairy products. Average per tonne realisation by Indian exporters has been $3,238 during April-February, about 19 per cent higher than $2,726 the same period a year ago. âGlobal prices have been higher by 15-20 per cent than the Indian domestic market,ï¿½?Sodhi said. Sources said the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF), the second largest dairy co-operative in the country after GCMMF, has shipped out around 1,000 tonnes of SMP during the year. Sufficient Stocks Despite record exports, Indian dairy players still holding sufficient stocks of SMP and other products. Early rains down South may lead to early onset of flush or peak producing season in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, sources said. Current SMP stocks in the country are upwards of over one lakh tonne, which is sufficient to meet requirements this summer, Sodhi said. Commenting on export prospects for the current financial year, he said, âThe outlook is good. This year also we have got good orders. As the Indian market is good, we are not committing more for the export marketï¿½?"
444,1,Stocks that brokerages bet on for bumper returns,1763 words,Business Standard,"Most brokerages, however, remain optimistic and expect another year of double-digit returns from the broader market. The Sensex was up 18 per cent in 2021-22 (FY22) ï¿½?its second consecutive year of double-digit returns. Brokerages expect 13.6 per cent upside on average from BSE 200 stocks over the next 12 months, with the top performing stocks expected to rise 25-30 per cent by the end of 2022-23 (FY23). The confidence clearly reflects in their stock recommendations. For example, there are 5,127 analyst recommendations for stocks that are part of the BSE 200 index. Of which, 4,449 recommendations, or 87 per cent of total, are either âbuyï¿½?or âholdï¿½?recommendations. There are only 678 âsellï¿½?recommendations, which gives a ratio of more than five âbuyï¿½?calls for every âsellï¿½?rating. Analysts see strong double-digit growth in corporate earnings in FY23 to trigger a fresh round of rally in the markets. Banks and information technology (IT) companies like ICICI Bank, State Bank of India, Infosys, HCL Technologies, and Tech Mahindra are expected to top the growth charts, with higher-than-average increase in revenue and profits. Many brokerages also expect a positive surprise from top companies in consumer durables, automotive (auto), capital goods, and insurance sectors. Here are 10 stocks which are most popular with brokerages right now and are expected to deliver maximum upside over the next 12 months.  Bharat Petroleum Corporation  The public sector crude oil refiner and marketer is among the top picks of analysts, with 34 âbuyï¿½?recommendations and just one âsellï¿½?call Analysts expect the stock to gain 24 per cent from the current levels, even though it is down 5 per cent in the last 12 months  Bharat Petroleum Corporationâs (BPCLâs) net profit was down 6.2 per cent year-on-year (YoY) in the first nine months of FY23 due to factors like inventory loss and lower marketing margins Analysts expect a turnaround in its earnings in FY23, driven by higher refining margins and improvement in marketing margins due to fuel price hikes The stock also gets support from an incredibly low valuation with trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) of 6.4x and price-to-book (P/B) value of 1.5x The governmentâs sale of BPCL should also lead to better price discovery for the stock  ICICI Bank  ICICI Bank is one of the top recommended stocks on Dalal Street (D-Street) right now. It has 51 âbuyï¿½?recommendations, one âholdï¿½? and zero âsellï¿½?rating, indicating analystsï¿½?strong conviction in the lenderâs long-term growth potential Its net profit was up 59.3 per cent YoY ï¿½?among the fastest in the banking industry ï¿½?in the trailing 12-months (TTM) ended December 2021 Analysts expect the bankâs earnings momentum to continue, driven by higher credit growth, margin improvement, and lower provisioning for bad loans The bank also scores on higher retail and digital orientation, and strong capital and provision buffers The risk to the stock comes from a steady rise in bond yields and potential rate hike by the Reserve bank of India that could result in lower margins in the first half of FY23  Larsen & Toubro  Larsen & Toubro (L&T) is another Street favourite in the large-cap space, with 41 âbuyï¿½?recommendÂ­ations and just one âsellï¿½?rating The stock is up around 25 per cent in one year and brokerages expect further gains of 27 per cent in the next 12 months A good showing by L&T in FY22 was driven by a strong rebound in its core earnings (excluding other income) and a better-than-expected performance by its three IT subsidiaries Its core earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation was up nearly 121 per cent on a consolidated basis during the TTM ended December 2021 Analysts expect L&T to report high double-digit growth in earnings in FY23, driven by faster growth in its core engineering, procurement and construction business and continued good performance by its IT subsidiaries L&Tâs earnings, however, face risk from low government expenditure in FY23 and margin pressure in its IT business  SBI Life Insurance  Brokerages expect SBI Life Insurance (SBI Life) to do well, given that target prices indicate an over 31 per cent upside over the next 12 months. The stock has 35 âbuyï¿½?ratings, zero âsellï¿½?recommendations, and three âholdï¿½?calls The life insurerâs net profit was up 56.3 per cent YoY in the third quarter of FY22 after two quarters of earnings contraction Analysts now expect it to maintain the earnings momentum in FY23 as well, driven by faster growth in premium income, new product offerings, and margin improvement The life insurance industry, however, faces challenges from rising inflation and cost of living that could adversely affect premium growth/new business in FY23 The SBI Life stock also faces downside risk from its rich valuation, with trailing P/E of 84x and P/B value of 10x  Indraprastha Gas  A consistent performer in the city gas distribution space, the company has posted an annual volume growth of 11 per cent and an earnings growth of 30 per cent over 2017-18 through to 2019-20. The gains have come on the back of regulatory support and favourable economics There are near-term headwinds, given the rising cost of liquefied natural gas and high spot price of non-administered pricing mechanism gas, but gas is still cheaper than other fuels  ICICI Securities believes that the economics of usage, environmental compulsions, and growing addressable market will continue to support stellar volume growth during FY22-FY24 A long-term trigger could be the companyâs plan to set up battery charging stations on the battery swapping model Valuations are attractive, given the 30 per cent decline in the stock price in the past six months  Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals  After the recent acquisition of Butterfly Gandhimathi Appliances, the company is looking at gaining 15-20 per cent share of the small kitchen market by unlocking synergies from sourcing, manufacturing, and innovation While inflationary headwinds could impact near-term margins, IIFL Research says the company has been ahead of peers in relation to managing costs and restoring gross margins in the second half of calendar year 2021 Strong brand recall, product innovaÂ­tÂ­ion pipeline, industry-leading operating profit margin, and go-to market strategy may prop 2020-21 through to 2023-24 (FY24) annual net profit growth to 11 per cent, says Elara Capital The company has a strong balance sheet, with net cash of over ~1,000 crore, which should help drive future acquisitions and growth plans  Infosys  Deal intake of $2.3 billion in the March quarter (fourth quarter, or Q4) and $9.5 billion in FY22 give good growth visibility in FY23, with large deals at their highest ever  Infosys has guided for a 13-15 per cent YoY revenue growth on broad-based demand, strong deal pipeline, and client mining efforts. Brokerages say there could be upward revision to it, given past trends Wage inflation, investments, and rise in travel and other costs have led to a moderation in the FY23 margin guidance to 21-23 per cent. High attrition of nearly 28 per cent in Q4 is also a concern ï¿½?a trend also seen with peers However, Motilal Oswal Research believes Infosys could deliver margins on the higher side of its guidance band, with strong growth and reduced dependence on sub-contractors as attrition falls Brokerages expect Infosys to outpace Tata Consultancy Services on FY23 revenue growth and remain a beneficiary of accelerated global IT spends  Mahindra & Mahindra  The auto segment is expected to get back on the growth trajectory in FY23, with the global semiconductor shortage showing signs of easing and production ramping up With utility vehicles accounting for 48 per cent of passenger vehicle sales, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) will stand to benefit, given its vast portfolio in the segment The companyâs focus on creating a diverse electric vehicle (EV) portfolio comprising 17 new products (FY24 onwards), including light commercial vehicles and three-wheelers, is another positive M&M is also looking at value unlocking by getting a strategic partner to fund growth and expansion in the EV business Strong agriculture exports, record kharif crop acreage, and normal monsoon rainfall should support tractor demand in FY23, according to Nomura, although current trends indicate sluggish performance  State Bank of India  State Bank of India (SBI) ï¿½?Indiaâs biggest bank by assets ï¿½?is also a favourite of D-Street right now. The stock is up 50 per cent in the last 12 months, driven by strong earnings growth  SBIâs net profit was up 65.4 per cent YoY in the TTM ended December 2021, largely driven by 32.6 per cent YoY decline in provisions for bad loans and decline in interest expenses  SBIâs gross interest income was up by a modest 2.7 per cent on a TTM basis Analysts expect SBIâs earnings to be driven by 9-10 per cent growth in its loan book and imprÂ­oÂ­vement in margins in a rising rate cycle The banksï¿½?earnings, however, face potential downside from a faster rise in cost of funds and a moderation in gross domestic product growth in FY23  UltraTech Cement  Most brokerages are structurally positive on cement demand, considering the upcycle in the housing sector and the governmentâs thrust on infrastructure Brokerages prefer UltraTech due to its leadership position, capacity growth, and efficient operations Sales volume for the sector will remain marginally lower in Q4, according to B&K Securities  UltraTechâs India volumes are seen falling 1 per cent YoY  Credit Suisse has an âoutperformï¿½?rating on the stock, given the strong long-term demand outlook and pricing discipline, with commoditiesï¿½?pull-back driving profitability Valuations are at attractive levels, as the sector trades below its historical average valuation  UltraTech is trading at 13x its enterprise value-to-operating profit, compared to the historical average of 15x."

879,0,I&B orders blocking of 35 YouTube channels for anti-India content,741 words,Indian Express Online,"It also passed orders to block two websites, two Twitter accounts, two Instagram accounts and one Facebook account. The ministry said in a statement that five separate orders were issued to block the websites and YouTube channels after intelligence agencies, which were closely monitoring these social media accounts and websites, flagged them to the ministry for âimmediate actionï¿½? The ministry issued issued the orders to block them immediately after it received the intelligence inputs on Thursday. The 35 accounts were all operating from Pakistan, and were identified to be part of four coordinated disinformation networks, the ministry said. It identified two of them as Apni Duniya Network, which was operating 14 YouTube channels, and Talha Films Network, which was operating 13 YouTube channels. âAll these networks appeared to be operated with a single goal of spreading fake news oriented towards the Indian audience,ï¿½?the ministry said. ExplainedTHE USE of Intelligence inputs to regulate online content comes in the wake of increased anti-India propaganda on social media by pro-Pakistan channels and sites. To curb the challenge, officials said, more such channels and sites are likely to be blocked. The channels used common hashtags and editing styles, and cross promoted each otherâs content. Some of the channels were being operated by anchors of Pakistani TV news channels. âThe channels propagated content to encourage separatism, divide India on the lines of religion, and create animosity among the various sections of the Indian society. Such information was feared to have the potential to incite the audience into commission of crimes adversely affecting public order in the country,ï¿½?the ministry statement said.

These, he said, were âvery, very toxic channelsï¿½? âIt was sort of a war against the country. War of misinformation,ï¿½?he said. The ministry invoked Section 69A of IT Act, 2000 to get the channels blocked. Chandra said that in December last year, the ministry had blocked 20 YouTube channels and two websites after receiving intelligence inputs. Fresh intelligence inputs were received by the ministry on Thursday,ï¿½?he said. The common factor in the blocked channels was that âthey operate from Pakistan and spread fake anti-India contentï¿½? He highlighted that the content was on âserious issuesï¿½?such as âIndian Armed Forces, Jammu and Kashmir, Indiaâs foreign relations, separatist ideas,ï¿½?and the recent death of Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat. He said the âintelligence agencies are now alive to this issueï¿½?and added that ânow since this process has started, Iâm sure more and more such channels will get blockedï¿½? He asked for people to send the ministry inputs on any channel or website involved in propagating such content. Speaking about the role of intermediaries such as YouTube and Facebook among others, Chandra said it is their responsibility also, and such content âshould get flagged in their systemï¿½?

548,0,"UPDATE6: Japan decides to put Tokyo, 12 more areas under COVID quasi-emergency",787 words,Kyodo News,"""This has been a fight against an unknown virus, but we hope to overcome this situation by preparing sufficiently without fearing excessively,"" said Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at a meeting of the government's COVID-19 task force. Along with Tokyo, which reported a record 7,377 new infections Wednesday, the targeted prefectures include its neighbors Chiba, Saitama and Kanagawa in the metropolitan area. The region saw a full state of emergency lifted about three months ago. The metropolitan government said Wednesday that while it will request dining establishments to shorten their business hours, it will make the suspension of serving alcohol optional. Nine other prefectures subject to the new quasi-emergency are Aichi, Gifu and Mie in central Japan, Nagasaki, Kumamoto and Miyazaki in the country's southwest, Kagawa in western Japan, Niigata in north-central Japan and Gunma in eastern Japan. Fukushima and Shimane prefectures are set to request that the central government impose emergency measures, their respective governors said Wednesday. Japanese authorities worry hospitals that need to treat patients not admitted due to the virus will be overwhelmed if infections continue to increase at the current pace and affect elderly people and those with underlying health conditions. Another concern is a shortage of essential workers such as medical staff due to a sharp rise in those designated as close contacts of people who tested positive for COVID-19. ""We need to quickly prevent the spread of infections, given the potential for a major strain on the medical system in the near future,"" said economic revitalization minister Daishiro Yamagiwa, who is also in charge of the government's coronavirus response. The government's subcommittee on the COVID-19 response gave the green light to the planned quasi-emergency stretching over roughly three weeks, as Japan's daily count of confirmed infections topped 40,000 for the first time, renewing its all-time high for the second consecutive day. While Kishida has made the COVID-19 response a top priority since taking office in October, his government now faces the difficult task of striking a balance between imposing anti-virus measures and keeping the economy going, especially as health experts say many people show no or mild symptoms despite Omicron's highly transmissible nature. Japan has never imposed a lockdown during the pandemic.  Shigeru Omi, the government's top COVID-19 adviser, suggested it is not necessary to halt both social and economic activities but urged people to avoid high-risk situations such as gathering in large numbers and speaking in loud voices. ""I think we don't need to have eateries close if people dine in groups of about four and speak quietly while wearing face masks,"" said Omi, who heads the subcommittee. Three prefectures have already been placed under a quasi-emergency since early January and the addition of the 13 will mean about a third of the nation's 47 prefectures are subject to stricter curbs. Under the quasi-emergency, governors can designate specific areas for measures against the virus and make their own decisions on business hours or the serving of alcohol at local eateries. The government will halt, in principle, the implementation of a program to check whether people visiting places like restaurants have been vaccinated twice or have proof of having tested negative for COVID-19 as a way of reviving economic activity, but still leave some room for governors to implement it on their own. ""We are aware that there are hopes for utilizing the program based on decisions by governors, who best know local situations,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said. The governors of Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo in western Japan affirmed at a virtual meeting on Wednesday that if one of them decides to seek quasi-emergency curbs, they will ask together. ""In light of the current infection situation, we are likely to decide on making a request within this week,"" Hyogo Gov. Motohiko Saito said. Matsuno said if the three prefectures ask to be added to the list, the government will swiftly review their requests. ==Kyodo"
217,0,"Richmond, B.C., hotel restaurant Bruno struggles to please all; Both food issues and cultural differences prevalent at new upscale Western restaurant",1096 words,The Globe and Mail (Breaking News),"Location: Versante Hotel, 8499 Bridgeport Rd., Richmond Phone: 604-242-2750 Website: versantehotel.com/taste[http://versantehotel.com/taste]  Cuisine: Opulent West Coast sharing plates Prices: Dinner: small plates, $12 to $38; large plates, $28 to $32; platters, $58 to $215; full-board experience, $125 a person (two people minimum). Seafood brunch: $59. Additional information: Open daily for breakfast, weekday lunch, weekend brunch and dinner. Reservations recommended. No takeout or patio. At around 9 p.m. on a recent Saturday night, the dinner guests at Bruno burst into spontaneous applause. They werenât clapping for executive chef William Lew, even though many of his dishes, presented on driftwood platters and under billows of smoke, are highly theatrical. Or the suave service from general manager Alessandro De Pieri and head waiter Ricardo Buyayo, who spins around the floor with arm twirls, heel kicks and the confident pizzazz of a Las Vegas showman. Or even the fact that Bruno, located in the new boutique Versante Hotel, is Richmondâs only upscale Western restaurant of note now that the Origo Club is closed. The dinner guests were clapping because the blazing overhead lights had finally been dimmed, casting welcome shadows into shiny corners and making the white-lacquered room look a little less like a cafeteria. Hotel restaurants have the toughest job. Bruno, like others, is trying hard to be many things: fine-dining destination, daytime hangout for locals and accessible eatery for hotel guests (serving breakfast, lunch, weekend brunch and dinner). On top of all this, Bruno faces the challenge of appeasing Chinese customs while also being approachable to a wider clientele. The lighting issue can be chalked up to cultural differences. Chinese restaurants are often brightly lit because Chinese people enjoy dining in a lively, loud, happy atmosphere. In Cantonese, the word for this is yeet lau, which, roughly translated, means hot festivity. Bruno, located in the most Chinese city in the world outside of Asia, must accommodate those preferences. And this new hotel, which is adjoined to the International Trade Centre, is owned by the Changzhou-born, Vancouver-based property developer Michael Ching, who probably has many of his own preferences to boot. That said, traditions are changing and some of the diners applauding that night were actually Chinese. There are other food issues at Bruno that canât be so easily explained. Bruno doesnât call itself a farm-to-table restaurant. This is probably only because all restaurants are trying to avoid that tired phrase these days. But its marketing materials do prominently reference âthe influence of local farms and food artisans that supply its ingredientsï¿½?and a desire to âshowcase the best of British Columbiaï¿½?in each dish. And Mr. Lew, who was previously chef de cuisine at Notch 8 in the Fairmont Vancouver Hotel, is definitely trying to make visceral connections from tongue to terroir with his creative plating ï¿½?some more successfully than others. Local oysters, farmed near Mr. Chingâs coming hotel developments in the Comox Valley, are presented on a kelp-draped log anchored to the plate with edible sand made from dried nori. (For now, I will gloss over the fact the XO mignonette, which contains neither dried seafood nor Jinhua ham, is really just a chili crisp, not an XO sauce.) Truffle lavender duck (nicely cooked but slightly tough and puffy, likely because the Fraser Valley duck isnât organic) is a rich, foie-gras-spackled ode to the glamping domes on Mr. Chingâs Cortes Island lavender farm, served in a picnic basket. Stanley Park is a nickname for The Iberico Tree, an elaborate display of hand-carved Cinco Jotas Bellota ham, hanging from slender branches planted in candied hazelnut soil with NeufchÃ¢tel tartlets tucked in a lofted nest. (This one is trying way too hard.) So why is a kitchen deeply committed to the local bounty and sense of place offering tasteless green tomatoes (on the otherwise nicely textured fall burrata salad) and white-bellied strawberries (on cakey, pre-cooked Liege waffles served at brunch) in February? There is no justification for any decent restaurant, no matter what it calls itself, to have those ingredients (most likely sourced from Mexico and California) on plates right now. And Mr. Lew, who is the former Ocean Wise chef for its sustainable seafood program, should know better. Bruno is trying hard, very hard, to impress with its tableside razzle-dazzle and luxury ingredients. Some of it is wonderful. The kurobuta pork belly, presented under a smoking glass lid, is beautifully marinated in Asian aromatics, deep-fried for a crackling shell and glazed in sticky black garlic while still sizzling. Flakey, pull-apart croissant scrolls, flecked with rosemary and pecorino, are irresistible, especially when paired with a side of brÃ»lÃ©e foie-gras butter. But in its obvious attempt to capture the Instagram generationâs attention, the kitchen misses some of the basics. The risotto, folded with uni, crowned with king crab and bejewelled with ikura, is overcooked and soft. At the lavish seafood brunch (an exceptional deal at $59 with optional buck-a-shuck-oysters), the English muffins for eggs benedict are cold and untoasted while the salmon-lobster topping is pulverized into a mush that looks like it came out of a can. There is potential here, but for now it feels superficial. Much like the hotel itself, which features dramatically designed rooms with huge soaker tubs enclosed in their own heated shower rooms, but no sound-proofing, robes, hot water (it took 10 minutes to heat up in the morning) or room service. I had a much better experience at Cask Whisky Bar, which is very dimly lit and located next door in the trade centre. And Iâll write about that soon. But there are another three restaurants opening next door. Mr. Lew is overseeing all of them. This isnât just a hotel, itâs a complex. Iâm afraid he might be stretched too thin. I hope he has a lot of help, because Iâd hate to see him booed off the stage. Plan your weekend with our Good Taste newsletter, offering wine advice and reviews, recipes, restaurant news and more.

663,0,The Saturday Debate: Is Meta in decline?,1611 words,The Toronto Star,"Metaâs big bet is on the metaverse. In the metaverse, people wearing AR/VR headsets or goggles interact via avatars with three-dimensional objects in virtual reality. Like social media, it is a space where sociality and commerce mix, but it is a more embodied experience of the internet. Someday it may be as much a part of our lives as social media is today, and Metaâs payoff will come if it is one day welcoming billions of people into this vast and evolving virtual space. Meta aspires to dominate the metaverse as it has social media and it is investing tens of billions of dollars in acquiring companies, hiring people, and developing technologies to do so. But its success is far from guaranteed. Competitors, such as Microsoft and Sony, are in the race to develop its own technologies to challenge Meta. In addition, the metaverse that has been built so far remains underdeveloped. The user experience is limited where clunky, often legless avatars engage in a restricted set of actions. There remains a long way to go. Another challenge for Meta comes through a shift in regulatory focus. In some places it is already underway and causing headaches for Meta. For instance, recent European Union legislation now prohibits the transfer of EU usersï¿½?Facebook and Instagram data to the U.S. It is proving such a challenge that Meta has recently threatened to pull Facebook and Instagram from the EU. While the EUâs data protection laws are more stringent than most, theirs may be a lead that others follow. For years Meta, mainly though Facebook and Instagram, could operate with no effective regulatory oversight curbing its ambitions. It is in a class of company, with Google another prominent example, called âsurveillance capitalists,ï¿½?that thrive by knowing, using, and monetizing the data on our human experiences. Regulators missed the boat to properly regulate surveillance capitalists at their inception as they failed to foresee the significant social and economic changes these new technologies had set in motion. Few could conceive of how people could generate such valuable data and how companies would exploit this. But power is changing. Some regulators are finally beginning to get to grips with social media. They are also keenly aware of the potential threats the metaverse poses, both in terms of companies gaining monopoly powers and in protecting the integrity and safety of peopleâs data. It is increasingly difficult for Meta to set the terms of engagement for social media, and it might become even more difficult in the metaverse. Metaâs decline will be hastened by the growth of new competitors, many that could emerge from behind âThe Great Firewall of China,ï¿½?that cannot simply be acquired. Meta and other non-Chinese tech brands cannot operate in the worldâs largest market. Behind this âwallï¿½?new technologies and companies are being developed and may advance to threaten Meta. We have already seen the impact that TikTok has had on Facebook and Instagram, and others will follow. A final challenge for Meta is the move to Web 3.0. The participative social web of today is called Web 2.0. We access it primarily on mobile devices and it is dominated by a concentrated set of companies, including Meta. Web 3.0 is a more decentralized internet. It is based on blockchain and cryptocurrency and aims to move power away from a concentration of central players. Web 3.0 might eventually allow individuals to have more control over their data and digital identities, which will pose a challenge to surveillance capitalists like Meta, which is built on acquiring and monetizing such data. With these many challenges, it will be interesting to see if the masters of Web 2.0 can maintain their preeminence in its next iterations. Aron Darmody is an associate professor of marketing, Sprott School of Business, Carleton University. Meta (a.k.a. Facebook) faced an unprecedented 25 per cent drop in its stock market value the other week. That is not the sort of thing that happens to companies that were recently (that is, just six months ago) in the Trillion Dollar valuation level. They are now 40 per cent of that. Absent any stock market cap, it is reasonable to ask whether this is it? Is Meta doomed? When examining this question we have to separate ourselves from the cheering going on at the sidelines regarding Metaâs decline. This is not a beloved company. There are many who believe we would be better off without its services and that it is destroying democracy. I am not one of those people but I have to say that Metaâs own PR makes it hard to defend it. My perspective, however, is that the market still speaks and with over 2 billion users who use the platform actively each month, Metaâs products are among the most popular products of all time. You might not pop onto Facebook daily to see what your high school friends are up to but when a family member or close friend passes away, you are grateful that it provides a forum for consolation. Put simply, it has become the platform of the moment for keeping in touch with others. The discussion of Metaâs decline involves three headwinds it faces. At its core, it is just a simple media business. Meta provides a platform where people can direct their attention and then, having grabbed their attention, Meta runs ads. Thus, Meta needs to grab attention and sell that for a high price. In terms of grabbing attention, Meta stands above all others. It has grown for a decade and a half at such rates that for the past while it is running out of ways to go. There arenât that many more users to attract in the world. And, more critically, peopleâs attention on the news and what their friends are up to, can only take up so much of the day. They have other things to do. TikTok has recently worked out how to keep people fixed to its app. But YouTube is no slouch and we are living in a Golden Age of Television. What Meta does have is a lock on that core aspect of social media ï¿½?news and connections with friends. While others, such as Snapchat, also play in that space, everyone is on Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp. It is how you keep in touch. Moreover, if any of you decides you donât want to use Facebook for that purpose, you have to get together and move as a group. Even if you could work out what group that was, where would you go? Facebook has achieved a lock on the network and there is simply no easy way for someone else to grab that mantle. Many have tried. Now they look for other ways to grab attention. Thus, Meta is entrenched and even if there are limited avenues for growth, losing that is even less likely putting a floor on the potential decline. Grabbing attention is one thing, making money from it is another. And it is here that Meta is facing a challenge. Before the iPhone, Facebook was a desktop app. Then people moved to mobile devices and Facebook had to invent mobile advertising with its more limited space for ads. To achieve this, Facebook became much better at ad-targeting ï¿½?knowing whether the consumer sees an ad and advertiser wants them to see. Thanks to moves toward privacy by Apple and Google, Metaâs old tricks are less effective. They estimate an 8 per cent hit to ad revenue, which is an even bigger hit to their bottom line. But the market fundamentals are still there. Metaâs problem is their advertiserâs problem and all are strongly motivated to solve it. If old tricks donât work, there will be new ones that will and will respect privacy. That part may keep consumers coming to Meta products. It will just take time. Meta has faced and overcome that challenge before. The final headwind is Meta itself. The name change reflects a vision change. Google did the same when it became Alphabet. The idea was to find new opportunities further from their core business. That takes dollars but can pay off. After all, Apple, the titan in this field, did the same when it became Apple rather than Apple Computer in 2007. The issue is whether Meta might end up more like Microsoft, which spent a decade stagnating before finding its footing again. But even there, thatâs not a story of decline but of a sizable bump in the road. Joshua Gans is the Jeffrey S.

423,1,TraceTogether token maker iWow debuts at 10% above IPO price,538 words,The Straits Times,"It was one of the most actively traded stocks on SGX in early trade, with 2.3 million shares changing hands as at 9.08am. iWOW had on April 6 launched its IPO, looking to sell a total of 26 million shares to raise gross proceeds of about $6.5 million. This placement constitutes about 10.4 per cent of iWow's enlarged share capital of 250.4 million shares. The company will have a theoretical market capitalisation of $62.6 million after the placement and a price-to-earnings ratio of 16.9 times. As at the close of placement at noon on Tuesday, all 26 million placement shares were validly subscribed for, with indications of interest received for some 78 million shares, meaning that the IPO was about three times subscribed. The group is notably one of the manufacturers of TraceTogether tokens. The company and electronics distributor Siix Singapore formed a consortium in 2020 and went on to win one of the tenders to design and manufacture subsequent batches of the tokens. Another tender went to electronics manufacturer PCI. Apart from these tokens, iWOW's other products include smart metering solutions to remotely monitor water and gas consumption, electronic monitoring devices for former offenders and accused individuals, and alarm alert systems for the elderly. As at March 8, TraceTogether tokens account for 16.8 per cent or $11.3 million of the group's $67.4 million order book. Some $54.2 million or 80.4 per cent of the order book comes from electronic monitoring systems. Smart metering solutions constitute $800,000 and alarm alert systems account for $1.1 million. For the financial year 2021 ended March, the group posted a net profit of $3.7 million - up from $220,000 in FY2020. This was due largely to a spike in revenue to $26.4 million from $4.4 million in the year ago. TraceTogether tokens accounted for 81 per cent of FY2021's revenue. Some 19.2 per cent of the total IPO proceeds, or $1.25 million, will be used to strengthen the group's research and development capabilities to provide customisable IoT solutions. A further 15.4 per cent or $1 million has been set aside to enlarge the company's customer base by engaging its existing business-to-business customers and expanding offerings to the business-to-customers segment. Another 7.7 per cent or $500,000 of the IPO proceeds will be channelled into expanding the company's market reach into countries such as Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. Other uses of the IPO proceeds include investments and merger and acquisition activities, as well as working capital and listing expenses. THE BUSINESS TIMES"
224,0,"As Olympic torch is lit in hope, I see light at end of the tunnel",790 words,Evening Times,"When Ivy League universities in America are closing their doors and sending students home until August, donât rule out the first cancellation of an Olympic Games since World War II.? The IOC and host nation Japan are still confident that the Games will go ahead as planned, but no one has any real idea on how long this might go on for. Just from athletes I have spoken to, there is definitely real concern over the Games. The concern isnât just over whether the games get cancelled or not. For each individual athlete, it is also over their own preparations. As an athlete, getting sick is never great and if you got this virus bad you might face missing weeks of training. It could result on you missing the podium in Tokyo.? Or missing the Games altogether. Another friend of mine told me of his concerns that if they move the Games then he might not even get selected.? With markets crashing and supermarket shelves being cleared, these are definitely interesting times for everybody. But when you are living during this Covid-19 pandemic with a spinal-cord injury I guess it becomes even more daunting ï¿½?as such an injury can remove your cough and sneeze reflex. With very little core function, the thought of not being able to cough is a pretty scary proposition.? This might not sound too bad. But this virus hits elderly people hard ï¿½?and this also includes your biological age due to underlying medical conditions. So this is a scary time, and I completely feel for everyone in the same boat as me how scary this is.?I remember back to catching the flu in November last year ï¿½?I thought I was going to stop breathing. I couldnât cough to clear my lungs as the level of my injury is right at the nerves which go to the lungs.? It knocked me out for weeks, so I would be lying if I said I wasnât slightly scared of Covid-19 and its possible effects on my lungs.? I am a very optimistic person who always looks for solutions over problems. But I must admit this has got me a little bit shaken.? Watching whatâs happening in Italy has been hard to believe ï¿½?particularly as life seemed to be continuing almost as normal here.? I looked at the MRI of a 44-year-old manâs lungs and it was unbelievable, unfortunately he didnât survive.? So I am staying positive but also taking advice from Austrian neurologist Viktor Frankl.?He speaks of acceptance of your current situation. These are his own words ï¿½?which I have had on my wall for the last four years: âThe meaning of life lies in finding a purpose and taking responsibility for ourselves and other human beings.ï¿½? In other words, by having a clear âwhyï¿½?we can face all the âhowï¿½?questions of life. This has got me through all those hours in hospital and continues to serve me daily.? Thereâs a reason that in-flight safety presentations always instruct us to secure our own oxygen masks before assisting fellow passengers. We canât help others effectively unless we first protect ourselves. So I spoke with a medical oncologist friend and they advised me to self-isolate.? I am now on day four and thinking this could be a long road ahead; thankfully the weather is getting warmer and I got out on my bike for a few laps of Richmond Park. Along with indoor turbo sessions I am well prepared mentally for the process. I guess all my time in hospital equipped my mind to deal with self-isolating. It also probably helps being an introvert.? I canât help but think of the poor people undergoing their cancer treatment right now though, as I prepare for my own hospital appointment in a few weeks, but I am grateful that side of things is under control. My main goal is keeping my immune system strong because another issue I have from my spinal-cord injury is a compromised immune system, thus moving me into a vulnerable group.? Itâs hard to go from a strong athlete to now feeling so vulnerable, but thankfully I have a strong mind."

Restaurant owner Salvatore Micali is captured on the CTTV performing a heroic citizenâs arrest on Mr Vrontamitis after he managed to disarm him. The footage captures horrified diners watching the mayhem unfold, while one woman rushed to call triple-0. Mr Micali bravely approached Mr Vrontamitis ï¿½?who stood in the doorway, threatening the woman with the knife ï¿½?before removing it from his hands. âI was holding him because he trusts me, because he knows me,ï¿½?Mr Micali said. âI told him to calm down and relax. At first he was OK, but then he started to get nervous and started to scream ï¿½?I just kept holding him.ï¿½?He said Mr Vrontamitis soon returned to an agitated state after he initially calmed down. âAfter seven or eight minutes he was trying to resist me, but I am quite a big man and it didnât work,ï¿½?Mr Micali said. âI held him until the police came.ï¿½?Mr Vrontamitis wore a black T-shirt with blue shorts and was shoeless at the time of the incident. He has been hit with serious charges including aggravated assault, assault with a weapon, reckless conduct endangering life, and reckless conduct endangering serious injury. He was remanded and will next face the Melbourne Magistratesï¿½?Court on April 20. Mr Vrontamitis had recently taken to social media to condemn Russian president Vladimir Putin in a series of posts.

459,1,"JPMorgan Chase sees momentum in lending, no real-time credit deterioration",415 words,SNL Bank and Thrift Daily,"He also said the bank's ""core thesis"" for revolving credit card balances to recover to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year ""is still in place to a good approximation,"" with the ""takeoff moment delayed by six weeks or so"" because of the omicron coronavirus variant. He noted that higher revolving balances are also closely linked with higher net charge-offs. ""In general, industrywide loan growth outlook is quite robust,"" Barnum said when discussing the outlook for deposit growth. Loan growth should support industrywide deposit growth, helping to offset headwinds from tighter monetary policy. ""Our base case remains modest growth in deposits for us as a company,"" Barnum said. Overall, JPMorgan Chase's average loans increased 0.8% sequentially to $1.069 trillion. The sum of its average interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits increased 1.9% to $2.516 trillion. Barnum said the bank does not plan to deploy a significant amount of its excess liquidity into longer-duration securities. ""Given the timing and expected speed of the rate hikes, increasingly, it just kind of doesn't matter that much,"" he said. The bank maintained its previous guidance for 2022 net interest income, excluding its markets business, of more than $53 billion. Barnum said higher interest rates implied by markets would probably add ""a couple billion dollars"" to net interest income but that the bank would give more detail at its investor day May 23.  JPMorgan Chase added to its credit loss allowance in the first quarter, in part because of modestly higher probabilities for a recession in the models it uses to determine reserves. But Barnum said the bank has yet to see any signs of fundamental credit deterioration in its portfolios. ""In this environment, everyone's looking very closely everywhere for any risks and trying to see around the corner,"" Barnum said. ""But as of right now, we're really not seeing anything of concern in the kind of spot metrics, so to speak."""
552,0,"UPDATE4: Japan to put Tokyo, 12 other areas under COVID quasi-emergency",650 words,Kyodo News,"Japanese authorities worry hospitals that need to treat patients not admitted due to the virus will be overwhelmed if infections continue to increase at the current pace and affect more elderly people and those with underlying health conditions. Another concern is a shortage of essential workers such as medical staff due to a sharp rise in those designated as close contacts of people who tested positive for COVID-19. ""We need to quickly prevent the spread of infections, given the potential for major strain on the medical system in the near future,"" said economic revitalization minister Daishiro Yamagiwa, who is also in charge of the government's coronavirus response. The government's subcommittee on the COVID-19 response gave the green light to the planned quasi-emergency stretching over roughly three weeks, a day after Japan's daily count of confirmed infections topped 30,000 for the first time. While Kishida has made the COVID-19 response a top priority since taking office in October, his government now faces the difficult task of striking a balance between imposing anti-virus measures and keeping the economy going, especially as health experts say many people show no or mild symptoms despite Omicron's highly transmissible nature.  Shigeru Omi, the government's top COVID-19 adviser, suggested it is not necessary to halt both social and economic activities but urged people to avoid high-risk situations such as gathering in large numbers and speaking in loud voices. ""I think we don't need to have eateries close if people dine in a group of about four and speak quietly while wearing face masks,"" said Omi, who heads the subcommittee. Three prefectures have already been placed under a quasi-emergency since early January and the planned addition of the 13 will mean about a third of the nation's 47 prefectures are subject to stricter curbs. Along with Tokyo, the targeted prefectures include its neighbors Chiba, Saitama and Kanagawa in the metropolitan area, which saw a full state of emergency lifted about three months ago. Aichi, Gifu and Mie in central Japan, along with Nagasaki, Kumamoto and Miyazaki in the country's southwest, are also asking the central government to impose a quasi-emergency, as are Niigata, Gunma and Kagawa. Under the quasi-emergency, prefectural governors can designate specific areas for measures against the virus and make their own decision on business hours or the serving of alcohol at local eateries. The government plans to halt, in principle, the implementation of a program to check whether people visiting places like restaurants have been vaccinated twice or have proof of having tested negative for COVID-19 as a way of reviving economic activity, but still leave some room for governors to implement it on its own. ""We are aware that there are hopes for utilizing the program based on decisions by governors, who best know local situations,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said. The governors of Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo in western Japan are planning to discuss whether to seek quasi-emergency curbs at a virtual meeting on Wednesday. Matsuno said if the three prefectures make requests to be added to the list, the government will swiftly review them. ==Kyodo"
297,1,"GWM Invests CNY 9 billion on R&D, Focusing on New Energy and Intelligentization",514 words,PR Newswire Asia,"Lv Wenbin, General Manager of Technology of GWM HAVAL, said that facing competition in the global market, GWM has always insisted on the concept of ""excessive investment and precise R&D"" to fulfill the diversified personalized needs of global users. Over the past years, GWM has continued to carry out precise investments in both new energy and intelligent sectors and keep launching various advanced technologies to the markets. In the new energy sector, GWM officially unveiled the L.E.M.O.N. DHT. As a highly integrated and high-efficient hybrid system, this technology is compatible with and can be equipped in both HEV and PHEV power architectures. Among them, the overall powertrain efficiency of models equipped with HEV power architectures can be improved by more than 50%. In the on-site testing, the fuel-saving rate of these models can achieve 35% to 50% compared to other fuel models. Take HAVAL JOLION HEV as an example. Supported by the L.E.M.O.N. DHT, its fuel consumption can be automatically adjusted to maximize fuel efficiency in different driving modes such as standard, sports and ECO. This function can meet users' needs in various scenarios, including urban roads, express ways and other driving conditions. In the intelligence sector, GWM launched Coffee Intelligence 2.0 and grandly unveiled a new electronic and electrical architecture and intelligent drive-by-wire chassis last year. Based on all these technological improvements, the development of Coffee Intelligence 2.0 also focuses on upgrading the intelligent driving technology and developed the NOH (Navigation On HIPilot) intelligence-assisted driving navigation system. When the system turns on, the vehicle can automatically assist the driver in lane changing, overtaking and other actions in the driving process. It can also monitor whether the driver is fatigued, unable to concentrate or in other conditions, reflecting the user-oriented design of the system. Science and technology make it possible for more users to enjoy a more comfortable driving experience. On the 8th Technology Festival held by the company, GWM announced that it would continue to expand the global research and development staff to 30,000 and the total investment in the next five years would reach CNY 100 billion. In addition to the research and development sector, GWM is also actively building a low-carbon auto industrial chain connecting the whole world. It has proposed to build its first zero-carbon factory by 2023 to provide a more intelligent, safer and more environmentally friendly driving experience for global users. SOURCE GWM"

In addition to the Australian criminal proceedings, Mr Forrest filed civil proceedings against Facebook in California in September last year. The Commonwealth charges allege the scam advertisements ï¿½?which used Mr Forrestâs name and image, and claim to promote crypto investment schemes ï¿½?have appeared on Facebook since March 2019, and that Facebook failed to create controls or a corporate culture to prevent its systems from being used to commit crime. âIâm doing this because Iâm concerned about innocent Australians being scammed through clickbait advertising on social media,ï¿½?Mr Forrest said in a statement. âIâm committed to ensuring that social media operators donât allow their sites to be used by criminal syndicates.ï¿½? Facebook could be fined if found guilty of the charges, brought under the Commonwealth Criminal Code with the consent of Federal Attorney-General Michaelia Cash. A spokesman for Meta, Facebookâs parent company, said the company could not comment given it was an active legal matter.

The chain kicked off with about 100 restaurants located mainly at airports and train stations across the nation. But the number has fallen drastically over the years amid stiff competition. By 2012, it had Â­dwindled to 30, which further dropped to eight by 2020. âThe disease outbreak has dealt a fatal blow to the brand, but it has not been successful over the past decade due to stern challenges from a raft of local restaurant chains,ï¿½?said Chen Xiao, CEO of Shanghai Yacheng Culture, a consultancy dealing with marketing and branding for foreign and local companies. âAfter all, the five outlets and the brand are of little value to Yumâs businesses in China.ï¿½?East Dawning was the first Chinese-style fast-food brand created by Yum China to tap the market potential on the mainland. It combines KFCâs business model with Chinese cuisine. The menu includes steamed pastries such as buns and Chinese tea. The fast-food brand has been eclipsed by the rise of Chinese restaurant chains such as Da Niang Dumpling and Yangâs Dumplings, which are adept at cooking Chinese food to appeal to local tastes. The mainlandâs catering Â­sector has taken a beating from the Â­coronavirus outbreak over the past two years as lockdowns and social-distancing rules have kept customers at bay. In 2020, restaurants across the country reported total revenue of 3.95 trillion yuan (HK$4.88 trillion), a decline of 15.4 per cent on the year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. In the first half of 2021, the catering industry raked in sales of 2.17 trillion yuan, up by 48.6 per cent from a year ago but virtually unchanged from the same period in 2019.  Yum China, whose other brands include Little Sheep, Huang Ji Huang and Coffii & Joy, operates more than 11,700 outlets on the mainland. It reported net profit of US$525 million in 2021, down by 15 per cent from the previous year. Revenue grew by 19 per cent to US$9.85 billion.

869,0,[Frantisek Vrabel] How Facebook became the opium of the masses,936 words,The Korea Herald,"Since its launch in 2004, Facebook has grown from a studentsï¿½?social networking site into a surveillance monster that destroys social cohesion and democracy worldwide. Facebook collects troves of user data -- including intimate facts, like body weight and pregnancy status -- to map the social DNA of its users. The company then sells this information to anyone -- from shampoo manufacturers to Russian and Chinese intelligence services -- who wants to âmicro-targetï¿½?its 2.9 billion users. In this way, Facebook allows third parties to manipulate minds and trade in âhuman futuresï¿½? predictive models of the choices individualsï¿½?likely will make. Around the world, Facebook has been used to sow distrust in democratic institutions. Its algorithms have facilitated real-world violence, from genocide in Myanmar to the recruitment of terrorists in South America, West Africa, and the Middle East. Lies about election fraud in the United States, promoted by former President Donald Trump, inundated Facebook in the lead-up to the January 6 riots. Meanwhile in Europe, Facebook enabled Belarusian strongman Aleksandr Lukashenkoâs perverse efforts to use migrants as weapons against the European Union. In the Czech Republic, disinformation originating from Russia and shared on the site has swamped Czech cyberspace, thanks to Facebookâs malicious code. One analysis done by my company found that the average Czech citizen is exposed to 25 times more COVID-19 vaccine disinformation than the average American. The situation is so dire, and government action so inept, that Czechs rely on civil society -- including volunteers known as the Czech Elves -- to monitor and counter this influence. Efforts to mitigate Facebookâs threat to democracy so far have failed miserably. In the Czech Republic, Facebook entered into a partnership with Agence France-Presse to identify harmful content. But with just one part-time employee and a monthly quota of only ten dubious posts, these efforts are a drop in the disinformation ocean. The âFacebook files,ï¿½?published by the Wall Street Journal, confirm that Facebook takes action on âas little as 3-5 percent of hate speech.ï¿½? Facebook has given users the ability to opt out of custom and political ads, but this is a token gesture. Some organizations, like Ranking Digital Rights, have called for the platform to disable ad targeting by default. That is not enough. The micro-targeting at the root of Facebookâs business model relies on artificial intelligence to attract usersï¿½?attention, maximize engagement, and disable critical thinking. In many ways, micro-targeting is the digital equivalent of the opioid crisis. But the US Congress has moved aggressively to protect people from opioids through legislation designed to increase access to treatment, education, and alternative medications. To stop the worldâs addiction to fake news and lies, lawmakers must recognize the disinformation crisis for what it is and take similar action, starting with appropriate regulation of micro-targeting. The problem is that no one outside Facebook knows how the companyâs complex algorithms work -- and it could take months, if not years, to decode them. This means that regulators will have no choice but to depend on Facebookâs own people to guide them through the factory. To encourage this cooperation, Congress must offer blanket civil and criminal immunity and financial indemnification. Regulating social media algorithms seems complicated, but it is low hanging fruit compared to even greater digital hazards on the horizon. âDeepfakesï¿½?-- the AI-based large-scale manipulation of videos and images to sway opinion -- is barely a topic of conversation in Congress. While lawmakers fret over the threats posed by traditional content, deepfakes pose an even greater challenge to individual privacy, democracy, and national security. Meanwhile, Facebook is becoming more dangerous. A recent investigation by MIT Technology Review found that Facebook funds misinformation by âpaying millions of ad dollars to bankroll clickbait actorsï¿½?through its advertising platform. And CEO Mark Zuckerbergâs plans to build a metaverse, âa convergence of physical, augmented, and virtual reality,ï¿½?should frighten regulators everywhere. Just imagine the potential damage those unregulated AI algorithms could cause if they are permitted to create a new immersive reality for billions of people. In a statement after recent hearings in Washington, DC, Zuckerberg repeated an offer he has made before: regulate us. âI donât believe private companies should make all of the decisions on their own,ï¿½?he wrote on Facebook. âWeâre committed to doing the best work we can, but at some level the right body to assess tradeoffs between social equities is our democratically elected Congress.ï¿½?Zuckerberg is correct: Congress does have a responsibility to act. But Facebook has a responsibility to act as well. It can show Congress what social inequities it continues to create and how it creates them. Until Facebook opens its algorithms to scrutiny -- guided by the know-how of its own experts -- the war on disinformation will remain unwinnable, and democracies around the world will continue to be at the mercy of an unscrupulous, renegade industry.

798,1,"British Airways offering GBP1,000 bonus to attract cabin crew staff amid COVID-19 staff shortage",265 words,COVID-19 Alerts,"Reportedly, airlines and airports are struggling to find new staff after making steep cuts at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.  BA and other airlines have been forced to cancel flights due to resurging demand ahead of Easter and not enough staff. One barrier to recruitment is that airline workers have to pass stringent security checks which can take several weeks or months to process. According to BA, applicants must have an airside ID for either Heathrow or London Stansted Airport as well as having completed cabin crew safety training, suggesting the company will look to rival airlines for staff. It also says that cabin crew who are not able to commence training prior to July 2022 if, for example, they have to work a long notice period, âmay not be eligible for the welcome bonusï¿½? Since the beginning of the year, BA has cancelled about 1,200 flights due to staff shortages and COVID-19 related absences. (EUR1=GBP0.84) ((Comments on this story may be sent to info@m2.com))"
877,0,Beer boss is accused of intimidating staff,434 words,The Times,"Watt, 39, took to an internal forum for investors to suggest that sources for the show could regret co-operating. ""All of this is very, very likely to end up in court,"" he said. Watt suggested that the BBC was likely to have told sources that their identity would remain confidential but that ""can never be guaranteed"". In a separate post shared widely on social media, he says the company is ""very concerned about the BBC's sources"" because many people it had spoken to left for disciplinary reasons and had ""an obvious axe to grind"". Some were dismissed for theft, poor performance, being intoxicated, abusing others, health and safety breaches and endangering colleagues, Watt said. He added: ""For the BBC to use a source who was dismissed, for instance, for theft and not cite that fact is neither fair nor responsible journalism."" Watt has been fighting to restore the company's reputation after dozens of staff, under the collective name of Punks with Purpose, signed an open letter in June alleging ""toxic attitudes towards junior staff"" and a culture of fear that had left many ""burnt out, afraid and miserable"". Bryan Simpson, of Unite Hospitality, said: ""Perhaps if Mr Watt had spent more time and resources over the last six months trying to resolve the issues instead of trying to discredit whistleblowers then there wouldn't have been a need for workers to speak out as part of the BBC documentary."" In a statement released yesterday Watt said hackers had made attempts to access his personal email last year. He said: ""The BBC appears to have acquired personal information that is entirely confidential and it's clearly a concern that [it] has been passed information that may well have come from that illegal hacking, or information that was otherwise illegally obtained. ""We also know false information has been given to the BBC, which, if broadcast, would be highly defamatory."" Watt has previously described appearing on the BBC show Who's the Boss? as one of his biggest mistakes and said it was ""a complete hatchet job"". Watt and his friend Martin Dickie, also 39, started BrewDog in 2007. Disclosure: The Truth About BrewDog is being shown on BBC1 on Monday."

89,0,Burger King says Russian operator 'refused' to close hundreds of restaurants,782 words,Washington Post.com,"In a letter to employees, RBI President International David Shear said the company demanded the shutdown of all Burger King operations in Russia but that Kolobov ""refused."" It has proved difficult to withdraw from the complicated web of business agreements established 10 years ago, he added. ""Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today? No,"" Shear wrote. ""But we want to be transparent with our actions and explain the steps we have taken to stand with the international business community in response to Russia's attack on Ukraine and its people,"" he said.  Burger King's experience illustrates the difficulty many corporations face when trying to extricate themselves from decades-old investments. Western corporations are under tremendous public pressure to leave Russia amid the humanitarian crisis enveloping Ukraine. Russia has become an economic pariah after the United States and its allies hit Moscow with a slew of sanctions. Russian financial markets have been shuttered for nearly three weeks, and at least 400 foreign corporations have exited the country. Some of Russia's government bonds ï¿½?just last month widely traded global assets ï¿½?are selling for cents on the dollar. But many corporations have found themselves bound to Russia by legal agreements, client relationships and other complicated entanglements. And those that do cease operations face the prospect that their local assets will be nationalized and restarted under Russian ownership, in some cases under trademarks that closely resemble Western brands. Businesses that operate through franchising models have had particular trouble leaving the country. Their ability to cut ties with Russia has been dependent on how many of their branded stores they actually own. ""When master franchise agreements and joint ventures are formed, there are extensive commitments to long-term investments and accountabilities to grow the business together. There are no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement,"" Shear wrote. ""Any current attempt to enforce our contract would ultimately require the support of Russian authorities on the ground and we know that will not practically happen anytime soon,"" he added. ""This is also why you may see other brands in Russia with similar structures continue to operate in the market."" The 450 Subway stores in Russia, for example, are locally operated and managed by a master franchisee. ""We don't directly control these independent franchisees and their restaurants, and have limited insight into their day-to-day operations,"" the company wrote in a statement Wednesday.  McDonalds, meanwhile, has pursued a global business model in which it directly owns more of the stores that carry its brand. It owns 84 percent of its roughly 850 Russian locations, allowing it to order the bulk of them to shut down, although it promised to continue paying employees. In his letter to employees, Shear said his team has been working around-the-clock to ""do all the right things."" RBI has suspended all new investments there, and is redirecting any Russian profits to the United Nations' refugee agency, he said. It's possible that Russian operators could continue operating Western-branded stores even when the foreign franchiser tells them to cease and desist. Russia's government and legal system does not recognize Western sanctions as legitimate, and is unlikely to enforce a foreign company's claim to its own brand. Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to nationalize businesses that try to pull out of the country. Various knockoff brands are already appearing in Russian trademark filings, for example, says D.C.-based trademark lawyer Josh Gerben. ""Russian trademark squatters are out in full force,"" Gerben tweeted Friday. He referenced Russian trademark filings for ""IDEA FURNITURE FACTORY,"" featuring a logo similar to Ikea's, alongside apparent Instagram imitators RUSTAGRAM and INSTARUS. Another Russian business, called Uncle Vanya's, trademarked a logo resembling the famed McDonald's Golden Arches, inverted on its side against a familiar red background."

330,0,Coronavirus: China bans unauthorised lockdowns to support 'in difficulty' services sector,730 words,scmp.com,"Local governments in China have been banned from imposing unauthorised lockdown measures, in the latest attempt to fine-tune the countryâs coronavirus policies and offer a boost to the âin difficultyï¿½?services sector. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) instructed all regional authorities to not impose any citywide or district-wide lockdowns that go beyond relevant coronavirus prevention and control measures issued by the central government or cut off public transport unnecessarily or without approval. Chinaâs top economic planner also urged local governments not to shut down or extend the closure of restaurants, supermarkets, scenic spots and cinemas without epidemiological investigation or a policy basis.

The commission said that local governments have to obtain approval from the central authorities before taking ânecessaryï¿½?lockdowns or adding more control measures. The new rules are part of efforts to adopt a further âtargetedï¿½?approach in virus rules to help services activities return to normal, the NDRC added. The moves are on top of a series of policies implemented to stop local governments from moves they had attempted to implement to disrupt travel during the Lunar New Year holiday season. Debates have continued over when and if the China will relax its coronavirus restrictions, as nations such as the United Kingdom, Denmark, Singapore and Vietnam have done, while the approval of Pfizerâs Covid-19 pill Paxlovid[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3166794/china-approves-pfizers-covid-19-pill-paxlovid-emergency-use] for emergency use was seen by some as adding hope to a turning point in the nationâs strategy. Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist with the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Tuesday that multiple teams in the country were studying how to improve the current anti-pandemic policies,[https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3167369/chinas-zero-covid-policy-under-review-economic-pressure] noting the pressure on private companies and the self-employed was already hard to bear. But on Friday, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the ruling Communist Partyâs corruption watchdog, argued that the countryâs âdynamic clearingï¿½?strategy was boosting the worldâs second-largest economy rather than undermining it.[https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3167515/chinas-zero-covid-policy-aids-economy-limits]  âNow as things are returning to normal in the US, consumers there are witnessing a spending rotation from goods to services.

On Friday, the NDRC also called for continued compulsory coronavirus testing in the services sector. It also encouraged regions with the capability to grant subsidies to retail sales companies to offer free tests to their employees at regular intervals, which should not be lower than 50 per cent. The NDRC also announced more tax incentives for the catering, retail, tourism and aviation industries. It will also guide online food delivery platforms to lower operating costs[https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3167567/chinese-directive-asking-demand-platforms-lower-merchant-fees-triggers] for catering businesses by reducing service fees or commissions.

864,0,Foreign bloggers present new ways for outside world to get a glimpse into China,629 words,Global Times,"Curt McArdle, a blogger from the UK who lives in Suzhou of East China's Jiangsu Province, called this BBC report ""nonsense."" He said that ""it's a pity because growing up in the UK, you are told that the BBC is the most trustworthy source of news. You're encouraged to believe everything they say. Over the past few years, I've learned that this just simply isn't the case. But not everyone realizes that yet."" ""My videos are never about politics or controversy. I just take my camera out on to the streets and show people the China that I see every day. I don't tell my viewers what to believe. I just show them China from my perspective and let them come to their own conclusions. Generally, people are amazed at how modern and vibrant China is and how happy and friendly Chinese people are!"" said McArdle. Other foreign bloggers that have been under similar criticism include Lee and Oli Barrett, a father-son duo on YouTube, and Jason Lightfoot - all of whom have lived in China for a long time and record videos of their daily lives in the country. McArdle said that the difference between the foreign bloggers that the BBC targeted, and the BBC itself is that the bloggers are here in China. ""They see it, they feel it, they experience it every day. These bloggers back everything they say up with facts and statistics, rather than rumor and hearsay from so called experts who have never even visited China."" Unfortunately, so much anti-China rhetoric has been forced upon people on a regular basis in the West and the UK, and it can become hard to ignore. McArdle said that Westerners who want to know the truth about China need to seek out opinions from people who are actually living here and see if they agree with what the Western media say. ""Currently, the public opinion on China-related issues in the West is quite sick, unhealthy, irrational, and paranoid. Balanced opinions are rare,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times. Such opinions could be truly dangerous to the society. Western governments have been using such unbalanced and layman voices to demonize China and frighten the public, which leads to a hostile and ill-informed consensus, Li noted. Western media attacks whoever speaks well of China, whether Chinese or foreign, which shows how stubborn these media entities are on issues related to China, Li said. Under these biased attacks by Western media, these foreign influencers introduce China to the West in an objective way based on their own lives, experiences, and sentiments, which is precious. Meanwhile, it should be noted that the influencers are not necessarily related to or even supported by China, Li said."
19,0,What lies behind Partygate critics? Nothing but envy,986 words,Metro,"Come on, Rishi, open your to the nationwide poverty! LC, Walsall The Met issued 20 fixed-penalty notices for lockdown-breaking parties at No.10 yet the prime minister refuses to accept laws have been broken. These letter writers are envious because they had a miserable time obeying Covid restrictions, rather than using a bit of common sense and bending the rules a little. Really, Partygate was only so called because some scallywag decided a gathering of people constituted a party, even when there were no party hats, games or other highlights involved and the only topic was work. I hate to stand up for Boris Johnson (as it's unfashionable to) but it has escaped people's attention that he brought us though the pandemic and is now leading by example on the matter of Russia's attempted destruction of Ukraine, which has most of the rest of Europe trembling in fear over what president Vladimir Putin will do next. And while I'm about it, we're forgetting that Covid has cost the UK countless billions of pounds with the furlough scheme and people off work receiving financial support, benefit claimants getting extra money, and expensive test kits handed out willynilly. Then there's PPE, vaccinations? the list is endless. Well, now the party really is over because reality is dawning. Someone has to pay for all of this but if not me and if not you, then who? Perhaps some mysterious benefactor is going to replace the lost money. But with fuel prices being hiked (for no good reason, as far as I can see) and the knock-on effects of Russia's war in Ukraine, that's increasingly unlikely. .Party's over?.  .Boris Johnson . issued to some of the Downing Street Partygate participants is to be welcomed. The majority of British people followed the letter and the spirit of the law during the lockdown - unlike, it would appear, our hypocritical prime minister and members of his staff. vindication of the outrage felt by the British public. The initial issuing of 20 fixedpenalty notices to Partygate participants is to be welcomed. More will probably follow. However, the denials by the PM and other ministers that any Covid rules were broken are clear-cut evidence of attempts to mislead Parliament and also the British public. The hypocrisy of our country's leaders and their attempts to cover up the truth must now lead to resignations - they are clear breaches of the ministerial code. Alan Jensen, West Hampstead n Did I read this right? The Met will not be releasing the names of those they fine for the No.10 lockdownbreaking parties. So, as an employee of government, I can breach a law on But let's not let these things worry us. We can just bang on about so-called parties while Ukraine is razed to the ground and we struggle with bills. Funny old world, isn't it? Parliament was repeatedly misled when it was told that none of the pandemic rules had been broken at Downing Street and elsewhere in Whitehall. We now know the truth about those events. Resignations should now follow. The ministerial code is quite clear about this and there should be no exceptions. Al, Charlton A low blow but some good may come of this Col Blake, Ealing ? The results of the upcoming local elections in May could be tough on Boris Johnson for two reasons - people are still very angry about Partygate and they are very angry about big increases in the cost of living. There's a very strong likelihood people will not vote Conservative. n Linda Simpson (MetroTalk, Wed) is completely wrong to say she is 'on Will's side' after the movie star slapped Oscars host Chris Rock for making a joke about his wife's alopecia.

These energy price hikes are what happens when we're not in charge of our energy production and stupidly risk our national security by importing it. Come the next war, any belligerent country supplying us with power will switch it off, leaving us unable to manufacture weapons - and we'll be defenceless. If this had happened during World War II, we would have been easily conquered. Luckily, back then we had our own coal mines, which were able to churn out lots of coal to produce electricity and gas.

About the Annual Meeting Why have I received these materials? The accompanying proxy is solicited by the Board of Directors of ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. (referred to throughout this Proxy Statement as the ""Company"" or ""we""), the holding company for ConnectOne Bank, in connection with our Annual Meeting that will take place virtually on May 24, 2022. You are cordially invited to electronically participate in the Annual Meeting and are requested to vote on the proposals described in this Proxy Statement. Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? Holders of Common Stock as of the close of business on April 6, 2022, will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. On April 6, 2022, there were outstanding and entitled to vote 39,464,678 shares of Common Stock, each of which is entitled to one vote with respect to each matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. How do I vote my shares at the Annual Meeting? If you are a ""record"" shareholder of Common Stock (that is, if you hold Common Stock in your own name as of April 6, 2022 on the Company's stock records maintained by our transfer agent, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.), you may vote by proxy or online at the Annual Meeting. To vote by proxy, you may use one of the following methods: ï¿½?Telephone voting, by dialing the toll-free number and following the instructions on your proxy card; ï¿½?Internet voting, by accessing the Internet at the web address stated on the proxy card and following the instructions; or ï¿½?Vote by mail, by completing and returning the proxy card in the enclosed envelope. The envelope requires no additional postage if mailed in the United States. If you hold your shares in ""street name"", i.e., through a broker or other custodian, you must follow the voting instructions provided to you by your broker or custodian. Can I change my vote after I return my proxy card? Any shareholder of record has the power to revoke their proxy at any time before it is voted. You may revoke your proxy before it is voted at the Annual Meeting by: ï¿½?voting again by telephone or the Internet, or completing a new proxy card with a later date - your latest vote will be counted; ï¿½?filing with the Secretary of the Company written notice of such revocation; or ï¿½?participating in the virtual Annual Meeting and voting online during the meeting. What constitutes a quorum for purposes of the Annual Meeting? The presence at the Annual Meeting online or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Proxies marked as abstaining (including proxies containing broker non-votes) on any matter to be acted upon by shareholders will be treated as present at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum but will not be counted as votes cast on such matters. Why is it important to vote my shares? If we do not have a quorum present at the Annual Meeting, we will need to adjourn the meeting to solicit additional proxies. This will cause additional expense and delay for the Company. What vote is required to approve each item? Pursuant to the New Jersey Business Corporation Act (""NJBCA""), directors are elected by the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in accordance with the Company's Bylaws, each of the Company's directors has submitted an irrevocable resignation from the Board, which shall become effective in the event such director does not receive at least a majority of the votes cast in any uncontested election. In such event, the director's resignation will become effective at the earlier of (i) the selection of a replacement director by the Board of Directors, or (ii) 90 days after certification of such stockholder vote. Accordingly, in the event that a nominee for re-election to the Board receives a plurality of the votes cast, but not a majority, he or she shall be re-elected to the Board under the provisions of the NJBCA, but his or her service shall continue only until such resignation becomes effective. Therefore, as a practical matter, re-election to a new term on the Board requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. The nonbinding resolution with respect to executive compensation, and the proposal for the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accountants, require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting by shares represented online or by proxy. Summary of the Proposals How does the Board recommend that I vote my shares? Unless you give other instructions on your proxy card, the persons named as proxies on the card will vote in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors. The Board's recommendation is set forth together with the description of each item in this Proxy Statement. In summary, the Board recommends a vote: ï¿½?FOR the directors' nominees to the Board of Directors; ï¿½?FOR approval of the non-binding resolution with respect to executive compensation; ï¿½?FOR ratification of the appointment of Crowe LLP as the Company's independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. With respect to any other matters that properly come before the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders will vote as recommended by the Board of Directors or, if no recommendation is given, in their own discretion in the best interests of the Company. At the date this Proxy Statement went to press, the Board of Directors had no knowledge of any business other than that described in this proxy statement that would be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting. Who will bear the expense of soliciting proxies? The Company will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to the solicitation by mail, proxies may be solicited personally or by telephone, facsimile or electronic transmission by our employees. In addition, we have retained Laurel Hill Advisory Group, LLC at an estimated cost of $6,500 plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, including per call fees for each call made, to assist in the solicitation of proxies. We also have agreed to indemnify Laurel Hill Advisory Group, LLC against certain liabilities in connection with this proxy solicitation. PROPOSAL 1 - ELECTION OF DIRECTORS The Certificate and By-Laws of the Company provide that the number of Directors shall not be less than five (5) or more than twenty-five (25) and permit the exact number to be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. Our twelve continuing directors have significant and varied operational, financial, risk, technology, corporate governance, leadership and other experience, and possess diversity of thought, gender and race. Over the past several years, we have enhanced the industry and Company-specific knowledge of our Board of Directors with fresh perspectives brought by our new directors. We believe that our directors are active and engaged and have the skills necessary to guide the Company as it grows, as our business strategy and the banking industry around us continue to evolve and as the financial services sector becomes ever more competitive. Board Refreshment; Process for Identifying and Evaluating Nominees The Board continually seeks to refresh and improve its composition and has added new directors both as a result of the acquisition of other insured institutions and through searches when it was determined that different skill sets or points of view were needed for the Board. Pursuant to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter as approved by the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the ""NCG"") Committee is charged with the central role in the process relating to director nominations, including identifying, interviewing and selecting individuals who may be nominated for election to the Board of Directors. As part of the Board's commitment to refreshment, a mandatory retirement age of 75 for directors has been adopted. Since 2018, we have had four (4) new members join our Board of Directors. The process the NCG Committee follows when it identifies and evaluates individuals to be nominated for election to the Board of Directors is as follows: Identification Candidates to serve on the Board will be identified from all available sources, including recommendations made by shareholders. The NCG Committee's charter provides that there will be no differences in the manner in which the NCG Committee evaluates nominees recommended by shareholders and nominees recommended by the NCG Committee or management, except that no specific process shall be mandated with respect to the nomination of any individuals who have previously served on the Board. The evaluation process for individuals other than existing board members will include: ï¿½?a review of the information provided to the NCG Committee by the proponent of the candidate; ï¿½?if requested, a review of reference letters from at least two sources determined to be reputable by the NCG Committee; and ï¿½?a personal interview of the candidate, together with a review of such other information as the NCG Committee shall determine to be relevant. Evaluation The NCG Committee, in evaluating potential director candidates, conducts a check of the individual's background, interviews the candidate, and determines whether the candidate is eligible and qualified for service on the Board of Directors by evaluating the candidate under the selection criteria set forth above. The biography of each of the nominees below contains information regarding the person's tenure as a director, business experience, other director positions held currently or at any time during the last five years, information regarding involvement in certain legal or administrative proceedings, if applicable, and the experiences,qualifications, attributes or skills that caused the NCG Committee and the Board to determine that the person should serve as a director for the Company. The Board of Directors has determined that the Board as a whole must have the right diversity and complementary mix of characteristics and skills for the optimal functioning of the Board in its oversight of the Company. The Company considers the following requirements for each of its members of the Board: 1) Experience: Current and past work and Board experience; knowledge of the banking industry and financial services companies; familiarity with the operations of public companies; and business and management experience and acumen. 2) Personal characteristics: Ability to work collaboratively with management and as a member of the Board; ability to think strategically and develop a strategic vision or central idea for the Company; familiarity with and participation in the local businesses and the communities served by the Bank; integrity, accountability and independence. 3) Director commitment: Time and effort available to devote to being a director; awareness and ongoing education; attendance at Board and committee meetings and other Company functions; other board commitments; stock ownership; changes in professional responsibilities; and length of service. 4) Team and Company considerations: Balancing director contributions; diversity of skills; and financial condition. Board Performance Evaluations The NCG Committee and the Board believes that an effective director evaluation process enables it to gain insights into the effectiveness of the Board, its committees and its individual members, with the goal of continually enhancing Board performance. In this regard, each year the Board, through the NCG Committee conducts an evaluation of the performance, effectiveness and fulfillment of fiduciary duties of the Board as a whole, and of the performance of each member of the Board. The Board evaluation process generally comprises: ï¿½?an annual, overall board evaluation; ï¿½?an annual, individual director evaluation; and ï¿½?a background and skills matrix questionnaire. The evaluation is accomplished through completion of a written questionnaire by each director. The responses are provided to the NCG Committee, on an anonymous basis, and then shared with the full Board, also on an anonymous basis. The Board adopted a skills matrix that represents certain skills that the Board identified as particularly valuable to the effective oversight of the Company and execution of its business. The following matrix shows those skills and the number of directors having each skill, highlighting the diversity of skills on the Board, and the table below shows the length of tenure of our Board members.

Diversity Although we have not adopted a formal policy on diversity, the Board looks to promote corporate social responsibility and diversity when selecting candidates for Board service. When the Board determines there is a need to fill a director position, we begin to identify qualified individuals for consideration. We seek individuals that possess skill sets that a prospective director will be required to draw upon in order to contribute to the Board, including professional experience, education, and local knowledge. While education and skills are important factors, we also consider how candidates will contribute to the overall balance of the Board, so that we will benefit from directors with different perspectives, varying viewpoints and wide-ranging backgrounds and experiences. We view and define diversity in its broadest sense, which includes gender, ethnicity, education, experience and leadership qualities. As part of these efforts to promote corporate social responsibility, the following graphics summarize certain demographic characteristics of the Board of Directors: Total Number of Directors: Twelve (12) PART 1 - GenderIdentity Female Male Non-Binary Did Not DiscloseGender # of Directors 1 11 0 0 PART II:DemographicBackground African Americanor Black 0 1 0 0 Alaskan Native orNative American 0 0 0 0 Asian 0 0 0 0 Hispanic or Latinx 0 0 0 0 Native Hawaiianor Pacific Islander 0 0 0 0 White 1 10 0 0 Two or moreRaces orEthnicities 0 0 0 0 LBGTQ+ 0 Did Not Disclose Demographic Background 0 Nominees for Director For 2022, there are twelve (12) nominees for Director.

455,1,Vehicles sales increase by 19.4% in March,244 words,Namibia Economist,"In March 2022, vehicle sales were dominated by Toyota (47.5%), Volkswagen (13.2%), Nissan  (5.6%), Ford (4.4%) and KIA (4.2%). Simonis Storms economist, Theo Klein said the strong local demand for new vehicles could be a result of the N$13 billion paid in life insurance claims between the second quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2021. âThis is potentially one explanation for the strong local demand for new vehicles, creating major backlogs for certain brands as discussed earlier. This can also potentially explain why growth in instalment credit for households has been moderate to stagnant as well,ï¿½?Klein said. Klein said Namibian consumers can expect car prices to continue rising in 2022 in addition to higher costs of operating vehicles, such as higher fuel and spare parts prices. âIn a rising interest rate environment, we do also expect slightly lower demand for car loans,ï¿½?Klein added."
163,0,"Dust off the green ï¿½?St. Patrickâs Day festivities are back // In hopes of a pandemic turning point, parades and more are planned.",845 words,Star-Tribune,"Patrickâs Day, that the holiday could spark a revival of sorts, bringing throngs of people decked in green to the Twin Cities parades and pubs. âWeâre coming back in a really big way,ï¿½?said Katie Martin, president of the St. Patrickâs Association, which organizes St. Paulâs annual parade. The parade was canceled in 2020 and held as a drive-by event in 2021. The beloved holiday tradition, which draws thousands of spectators to Minnesotaâs capital city, will look slightly different this year. The parade route will be reversed, starting in Rice Park and ending near Mears Park for an event at CHS Field featuring live music, Irish dancing and concessions. The parade starts at noon on March 17 and the after-party ï¿½?dubbed the Ballpark Hooley and sponsored by Guinness ï¿½?begins at 12:30 p.m. Tickets can be purchased for $5 in advance or $10 at the door, and thereâs also a $40 VIP luncheon option. Minneapolis: A move north The Minneapolis St. Patrickâs Day Association is also planning to bring back its parade after a two-year hiatus ï¿½?but with a twist. Instead of marching downtown, festivities will be held March 17 in Columbia Heights, starting at 6 p.m. at the intersection of NE. 40th Avenue and Van Buren Street. The parade will conclude at John P. Murzyn Hall, where attendees can pay $10 for admission to the Blarney Blast, with Irish dancers, live music and a buffet. Sean Clerkin, president of the Minneapolis association, said the Columbia Heights Lions Club and VFW offered sponsorships after helping with a smaller event held in place of a parade last March. â[The parade] could move back to Minneapolis eventually,ï¿½?Clerkin said. âItâs just that itâs hard to turn down some strong sponsors at this time.ï¿½?Businesses make plans At Camp Bar in St. Paul, owner Bill Collins said he wonât be serving Guinness on St. Patrickâs Day as a small act of protest in response to the parade reversal, which he worries will draw business away from the W. 7th area. Collins said while the holiday isnât a huge day for his bar, he feels for many of his peers who suffered big hits when their 2020 plans were abruptly shut down. âIt just seemed like an unfortunate thing for a place thatâs already been beat up pretty bad,ï¿½?he said. But Boemer, who has owned Patrick McGovernâs for 40 years, isnât worried. Heâs just hoping they get lucky with Minnesotaâs unpredictable March weather. âA lot of these young people, theyâve been cooped up for a year or two. Theyâll be out,ï¿½?he said. St. Paul will not block off W. 7th for its LuckyPalooza block party ï¿½?usually held the weekend before St. Patrickâs Day ï¿½?this year, but many area restaurants are planning their own celebrations for Saturday. Patrick McGovernâs will have a parking lot tent and DJ like it has in the past, said Boemer, who added that the costs of closing down the street have risen over the years. âSome businesses canât afford that right now,ï¿½?he said. âSomeday weâll probably do it again, but itâs not going to be this year.ï¿½?Martin, the parade organizer, said the new route could draw more business to the Lowertown area. And there is plenty of time following the afternoon parade to head to other St. Paul restaurants and bars, she added. âIn a way, I think this holiday almost bookends things,ï¿½?Martin said. âCanceling the parade in 2020 was this realization that this COVID thing was real and itâs here. And I think having this parade now is making people feel like theyâre getting back to a sense of normalcy again.ï¿½?Katie Galioto ï¿½?612-673-4478"

213,0,"Sushi Kou, Casa among fine dining closures",637 words,Business Times Singapore,"Little is known about the ownership of Sushi Kou, which is registered under a Japanese food import company Edo Sushi Pte Ltd. Previous reports have quoted its founder Aimi Shibuya, who left Singapore for Dubai in March 2021 and is no longer associated with the restaurant. Before she left, there had been plans to open 2 more Sushi Kou outlets, as well as a Joel Robuchon cafe concept in Singapore. None materialised, however, and chefs who had originally been hired for the new outlets have also left. One of them, Taiga Kanekuni, subsequently took over a space at the Regent Singapore which was meant to house the second Sushi Kou outlet. He now runs his eponymous Taiga Dining with a different owner. BT understands that current head chef Yoshio Sakuta and most of the remaining chefs and service staff are in talks to open a new sushi restaurant together with a new investor - the Singaporean distributor of an ultra high end watch brand. Apart from Sushi Kou, Casa by Remy Lefebvre had barely opened for 6 months when it closed down abruptly on Dec 31 last year due to disagreements between the restaurant's owners and the head chef Remy Lefebvre. Although business had been slow-going due to Covid-19 curbs restricting dining-in to 2 persons a table with no music allowed, revenue started to pick up in December and was looking very promising, said Alejandro Blanco, managing director of Plan B ventures. The group also owns Mexican restaurants Senor Taco and La Mexicana Market. He added that the management had been in discussions with Lefebvre over staff complaints about him as well as the menu and operational changes but instead, the chef tendered his resignation. ""He did offer to stay until we could find a suitable replacement but given all the issues surrounding his resignation, it wasn't possible for Plan B to continue to work with him,"" said Blanco. ""The closure was very unfortunate and unexpected for everyone."" Plan B still holds the lease for Casa's premises at Chijmes, and the group has partnered with AC Concepts, run by Spanish chef Jose Alonso, to open a new restaurant called Lumbre in April. Alonso was the original chef of Binomio, and now runs his own eateries including the casual Spanish eatery Kulto in Amoy Street and Kilo in Duxton. Lumbre means fire, and the new restaurant will focus on meat, seafood and vegetables cooked in direct fire. In the meantime, 1-Altitude is also set to close on Mar 31 when the lease on its current premises expires. The restaurant is owned by the 1-Group, which runs restaurants including 1-Atico and Monti, and is in the midst of rolling out its new multi-concept 1-Arden project at the new CapitaSpring."

288,0,Liquor overhaul to revitalise beleaguered city's nightlife,367 words,The Age,"The move follows concern about the economic health of Melbourne's once-vibrant but now beleaguered CBD, as the state government's work-from-home recommendation ends tonight. It also follows other changes, including an end to density rules for hospitality venues, the reopening of dance floors and an end to mask mandates for most settings. The relaxation of restrictions, which will apply statewide, means the operators of bars, hotels, restaurants and cafes can extend their opening hours from 11pm to 1am on any night without applying for a new licence. Businesses will be able to get fast-tracked temporary licences to sell alcohol in outdoor areas in three days, with the government promising to waive fees. Councils could still veto some applications. Online sales of alcohol will face the same conditions as regular alcohol sales. That means businesses selling alcohol online will have to deliver in person to first-time customers to verify their ID and age. The government is also announcing greater clarity around alcohol advertising and promotions. Any efforts to sell booze that are deemed to not be in the public interest face bans, including ""advertising that is likely to appeal to minors, promotes violence or is of a sexual, degrading or sexist nature"".  Wes Lambert, chief executive of Restaurant & Catering Australia, said he had fought for the reforms. ""Pre-COVID, takeaway was only 8 per cent of restaurant revenues, and now it's anywhere between 25 to 40 per cent depending on the location,"" he said. ""To be able to continue the takeaway alcohol pivot ... will ensure that takeaway and delivery revenue remains."" Liquor Regulation Minister Melissa Horne said the changes balanced helping hospitality venues recover, but also ensuring harm minimisation was a key focus."
699,0,Digital piracy will kill off our broadcasting industry,504 words,New Straits Times,"With the rise of OTT platforms, we see a decline in television viewership. Nielsen data says there were 14.1 million OTT platform users in Malaysia last year, representing 78 per cent of the total viewing population aged 15 and above. This has transformed the broadcasting industry as production and distribution shifted online. Media conglomerates have also ventured into OTT platforms. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Netflix consumption in Southeast Asia increased by 115 per cent and the total streaming time using smartphones grew by 60 per cent from Jan 20 to April 11, 2020. For industry players and consumers, the wide content accessibility has consequences. One big concern is digital piracy. This has affected our economy as it steals creative content and is distributed online. Consumers can watch content for free or at a lower price. This affects producers and filmmakers. Piracy might end the broadcasting business as we lose an estimated RM3 billion annually, with RM500 million in taxes and thousands of jobs at stake. Different countries have their own policies and regulations to stop this issue from worsening. In North Korea, Netflixâs Squid Game was smuggled into the country and distributed illegally. In November, a North Korean was found guilty of bringing in the content from China and was sentenced to death by firing squad. Malaysiaâs Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 should be reviewed and better policy and regulations should be debated in Parliament to ensure the broadcasting industryâs relevance. The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), a regulatory body under the Communications and Multimedia Ministry, handles digital piracy issues. In February last year, a woman in Selangor was fined RM30,000 after pleading guilty to owning and selling TV boxes that can stream pirated content. Recently, the Malaysian Film Directors Association urged the ministry and MCMC to ensure the public understood the negative consequences of digital piracy. We need to work together to tackle these issues to advance our broadcasting industry. NURUL AYUNI MOHD NUZULRUDIN Master of Mass Communication, Universiti Teknologi Mara ( END )"
994,0,L'Occitane will not close Russian stores over 'retaliation' fears,378 words,The Daily Telegraph,"A spokesman for L'Occitane said: ""We are shocked by the atrocities being committed against innocent civilians. There is absolutely nothing that can justify the crimes against humanity that we are all witnessing at the present time. ""However, we cannot guarantee that our employees in Russia, and specifically our management team, will not face retaliation such as imprisonment, if we suspend our business activities without economic justification."" Hundreds of Western retailers, such as John Lewis, Next and Tesco, have shut stores in Russia in the wake of the conflict. Companies still operating in the country have attracted widespread criticism. Paul 'Pen' Farthing, a British former Royal Marines commando and founder of the Nowzad Dogs charity, said on Twitter: ""If you buy from L'Occitane please boycott their shops & online sales. The company is still operating in Russia. ""After seeing what I have in Ukraine they now have blood on their hands."" The beauty brand is sold in over 3,085 sites worldwide and made sales of ï¿½?.5bn (Â£1.3bn) last year. Companies including Lacoste and Leroy Merlin, the French retail group, are still operating in Russia, while airlines including Emirates Airlines and Turkish Airlines are still flying to the country. Others such as Burger King said they could not completely shut down operations after their franchisees refused to do so. The fast food chain has halted all corporate support including marketing and international supplies. Professor Vanessa Burbano, from Columbia Business School in the US, told the BBC: ""Customers and employees do pay attention to which companies are first in making these kinds of commitments and which firms don't go as far. ""The risk of companies making claims that may not be perceived as consistent with their actions is that they could be seen as a green-washing in the Ukraine context which would be bad for their reputation."""
435,1,eScooter sales inch up in upcountry markets,599 words,The Economic Times,"In Tier 2-3 centres, when we index e-scooter sales to their population i.e, e-scooters sold per lakh population in a town, 8 of the top 10 towns are Tier-2-3,ï¿½?said Ravneet Phokela, Chief Business Officer, Ather Energy.This yet again challenges the stereotype that Tier 2,3,4 markets look for value products and are predominantly price-driven. Consumers in these markets are beginning to see EVs as an upgrade - and the technology of the future.""All this drives the desire and aspiration, and the willingness to pay a premium for these products. Additionally, the fact that total cost of ownership is so attractive makes the overall proposition very compelling,ï¿½?added Phokela. His company retails the Ather 450X and Ather 450.In FY 2022, 231,000 e-two wheelers were sold, up nearly six-fold from the year ago.The latent demand was always there, but what plagued the market was the lack of credible EV options, said experts. In future, modern features, ride quality, reliability, efficiency, and overall customer ownership experience will play key roles in determining customer behaviour around EVs - both in big cities and small towns. The demographics of EV buyers today are very similar to that of the ICE scooter buyer who uses electric two-wheelers as their primary mode of commute. 90829087Non-bank lenders are also keen to finance EVs in these towns and have launched tailor-made financial packages for customers âThere is definitely interest to buy EVs in upcountry markets with enquiries going up in the recent past,ï¿½?said Ramesh Iyer, MD, Mahindra Finance.Iyer said, however, that it is difficult to say if a complete shift is taking place. Experts say that potential buyers are wary of the resale value of these products in such markets.In an independent finding, customers across cities are now focusing on the long-term value and features offered by electric scooters as ownership costs of ICE vehicles continue to rise.âHowever, the limitation is the spread of the retail network in rural markets. We are expanding our network here in these markets,ï¿½?said Sohinder Gill, President, CEO, Hero Electric, and President of the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV). âConsumers in these markets find electric two-wheelers a convenient mode of transport. With a perpetual shortage of fuel in these upcountry markets, EVs have become a suitable option.âHe added that the southern markets are leading the e-revolution, followed by Maharashtra and the eastern Markets.Electrification has made steady inroads in the two-wheeler segment in India, pushing the share of the vehicles sold to nearly 2% of the total in the segment.

228,0,next level delight,905 words,The West Australian,"Anyone who has guiltily pulled the salty, crispy, golden skin off a roast chook when no oneâs looking and eaten it without regard for calories or fellow diners, will love the chicken skin bar snack. The whole skin, not just mean offcuts, had been roasted with a weight on top, so that it remained as flat as ScoMoâs ukulele playing. It was crisp, almost entirely rendered of fat and heavily seasoned with a tart tamarind-infused salt. You eat it like potato chips or dip it into a silky avocado and chicken butter. Itâs a health food ï¿½?mental health that is. Eating this crunchy miracle will make you feel instantly better about yourself. Throw away the Zoloft. $14. Charcoal dough empanadas, $18, bring with them a strong smoky flavour from the charcoal blitzed into the dough. They are as black as a moonless night, crunchy with a filling weâre told varies from time to time. On this occasion it was black vinegar braised lamb neck and leek with a mellow tartness, religious levels of unction and lip-smacking collagen. Winner, winner. The butcher shop next door is owned by Gavin Olsen, the brains behind Nextdoor and the majority owner. As a showcase for his butchery and dry-ageing techniques, Nextdoor is a great ad. His dry ageing pushes 72 days for some cuts, arguably right at the limit of how much flavour one can get out of a shrinking piece of meat before it becomes too mummified, too challenging for customers and too hard to cook with accuracy. A 72-day aged 400g sirloin on the bone is $68 and an impeccable piece of meat. It can also be ordered at 800g for $128. Itâs cooked without fuss, directly on the coal fire. It was exceptional with more funk than Herbie Hancock and the reduced essence of pure beefiness. Its sauce was a creation of their own called chimarrao bearnaise, a bearnaise sauce blended with chimichurri sauce. Chimarrao is a strong tea from South America, so not sure where they make the chimichurri connection, but who cares. The sauce was like a fiesta, a rollicking, juiced-up party in the mouth. Regrettably this brilliant steak was a little overcooked and dry when we tried it. Picanha steak, $39, on the other hand, was perfection. In Australia we know picanha as rump cap, a cut loved by Argentinians and a staple of restaurants where waiters dressed in gaucho fancy dress roam the floor with skewers of meat. Chef nailed it: pink, juicy and well seasoned. It had been bagged with garlic and bay and cooked in the sous vide up to 54 degrees, which is pretty much medium rare. It was seared, fat cap down, on a super hot Himalayan salt block, then sliced. A small quenelle of the sauce was off to the side and a good amount of a clear, beefy, reduced gravy was spooned over the top. Thank you chef. Great cooking. Considering how long the beef has hung around in the fridge getting wrinkly, tastier and smaller, you are getting value. A side of âsweetcorn, potato, avocado, yolkï¿½?was a unique and courageous dish. Chef says it âeats like a trifleï¿½?as all the ingredients are layered as you would for a Christmas trifle pudding. We thought it might be a bit of a cluster, but it was a success. On the bottom was a layer of wickedly butter-infused whipped potato, followed by layers of chicken fat emulsified avocado, fire roasted, smoked and pureed corn and a confit yolk on top. $18. We sat at the concrete kitchen bar, watching the show from Pattisonâs small brigade. We were well advised on cocktails and wines. Our waiter was a bit of a Chatty Kathy (back off mate), but you canât fault enthusiasm, especially when the service is on point. You must order a Wagyu fat-smoked tamarind caramel with coffee. $12. Life changing. Nextdoor is interesting. It doesnât comply to many of modern cookingâs fads (no stracciatella, no chargrilled octopus). Its menu is attractive and desirable.

284,1,Why this German company is expanding in Knightdale,535 words,Triangle Business Journal,"""The new service hub will bring us even closer to our customers and allows us to provide faster service along with enhanced spare parts availability,"" said Ulrich Unterriker, managing director of the Optima Machinery Corp., in a statement. Optima operates subsidiaries around the world, including its U.S. office called Optima Machinery Corp. which is based in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and has been in operation for nearly 40 years. The service hub the company is opening in Knightdale sometime in the middle of this year will be its second physical location in the U.S. Opening a facility near Raleigh will provide a hub for service and support personnel and a place where the company can meet with customers. The site will also stock spare machine parts, which will allow the company to react quicker to nearby customers, Unterriker told the Triangle Business Journal. With the opening of the facility, the company also plans to increase its number of employees in the Triangle and throughout the U.S. In its statement, the company said it has more than 50 sales and service employees who provide on-site support to pharmaceutical customers in the U.S. Optima, the parent company, employs more than 2,650 people ï¿½?mostly based in Germany ï¿½?according to an annual report [https://newsroom.optima-packaging.com/en/annual-report-2020-2021-optima-continues-its-growth-curve] the company released in April 2021. Additionally, the report said the company's consolidated revenue in 2020 was more than 420 million euros ï¿½?about $455 million at the existing exchange rate. Aside from pharma, Optima's other business units focus on packaging machines for consumer products like food and cosmetics; paper hygiene products and life science products, like wound dressings, according to the company's website [https://www.optima-packaging.com/en-us]. Optima is one of a number of pharma or biotech service providers who are moving into or expanding in the Triangle as the pharma and biotech industries continue to grow. In December, a Canadian contract vivarium organization called Mispro Biotech Services announced its plans [https://www-bizjournals-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/triangle/news/2021/12/12/contract-vivarium-organization-adding-space-in-rtp.html] to build a 6,000-square-foot facility in Research Triangle Park. This is in addition to an existing 10,000-square-foot facility the company operates. The company offers biotech firms rental space to conduct their own preclinical research studies involving rodents. Last month, the Florida-based biomedical firm Cryo-Cell International (Nasdaq: CCEL) unveiled its plans [https://www-bizjournals-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/triangle/news/2022/03/23/stem-cell-firm-buys-property-in-durham.html] to continue growing its Triangle presence with a 56,000-square-foot facility in Durham.

876,0,Beer boss is accused of intimidating staff,434 words,The Times,"Watt, 39, took to an internal forum for investors to suggest that sources for the show could regret co-operating. ""All of this is very, very likely to end up in court,"" he said. Watt suggested that the BBC was likely to have told sources that their identity would remain confidential but that ""can never be guaranteed"". In a separate post shared widely on social media, he says the company is ""very concerned about the BBC's sources"" because many people it had spoken to left for disciplinary reasons and had ""an obvious axe to grind"". Some were dismissed for theft, poor performance, being intoxicated, abusing others, health and safety breaches and endangering colleagues, Watt said. He added: ""For the BBC to use a source who was dismissed, for instance, for theft and not cite that fact is neither fair nor responsible journalism."" Watt has been fighting to restore the company's reputation after dozens of staff, under the collective name of Punks with Purpose, signed an open letter in June alleging ""toxic attitudes towards junior staff"" and a culture of fear that had left many ""burnt out, afraid and miserable"". Bryan Simpson, of Unite Hospitality, said: ""Perhaps if Mr Watt had spent more time and resources over the last six months trying to resolve the issues instead of trying to discredit whistleblowers then there wouldn't have been a need for workers to speak out as part of the BBC documentary."" In a statement released yesterday Watt said hackers had made attempts to access his personal email last year. He said: ""The BBC appears to have acquired personal information that is entirely confidential and it's clearly a concern that [it] has been passed information that may well have come from that illegal hacking, or information that was otherwise illegally obtained. ""We also know false information has been given to the BBC, which, if broadcast, would be highly defamatory."" Watt has previously described appearing on the BBC show Who's the Boss? as one of his biggest mistakes and said it was ""a complete hatchet job"".

87,0,Russia's Burger King refuses to shut and 800 restaurants will remain open despite the brand's boycott of Moscow,1216 words,Mail Online,"* Companies have faced pressure to condemn Putin's invasion by severing ties Russia has refused to close down their 800 Burger King restaurants despite demands from the company to suspend all trading, owners have said. The parent company of Burger King, Restaurant Brands International, announced that all operations would end for their franchised outlets in Russia following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which is now well into its third week. But the main operator of the business, businessman Alexander Kolobov, who is in a joint partnership with Restaurant Brands and oversees the day-to-day of the 800 restaurants, has 'refused' to close down the chain. President Putin's continued attacks on war-torn Ukraine has seen international brands sever all business ties with Russia in attempt to suffocate the state's economy. Russians have been finding it increasingly difficult to get their hands on Western goods as more sanctions are imposed by governments and corporate companies. The fast-food chain joined the Russian market a decade ago, and it trades through a joint-venture Mr Kolobov and investment banking firms in Ukraine, Investment Capital Ukraine, and Russia, VTB Capital.  Restaurant Brands wrote a letter to employees on Thursday, where international president David Shear said: 'We contacted the main operator of the business and demanded the suspension of Burger King restaurant operations in Russia. 'He has refused to do so.'  VTB Capital, Russia's second largest bank, was sanctioned by US, UK and other European countries on February 24 onwards, the day the large-scale invasion of Ukraine began. Like many other western firms, Burger King has tried to suspend their Russian outlets, but they alongside UK retailer Marks and Spencer have not been able to. This is because of 'complicated' legal arrangements within the company's structure and long-term franchise agreements limits its ability to close the restaurants, Mr Shear continued: 'I know that many of you have been following the horrifying attacks on Ukraine. There have been a lot of media reports about brands continuing to operate in Russia and internally, we have been working around the clock to do all the right things. 'These are the actions we have taken to date: 'The economic sanctions that have been imposed by many countries include VTB Bank and its controlled affiliates, including VTB Capital and I want you to know that we are in full compliance with all applicable sanctions. 'We have been asked why we canât unilaterally suspend operations. I want to answer that question directly. 'When master franchise agreements and joint ventures are formed, there are extensive commitments to long-term investments and accountabilities to grow the business together. 'There are no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement. No serious investor in any industry in the world would agree to a long-term business relationship with flimsy termination clauses. 'This is exactly why we say itâs a complicated legal process when we are asked why we canât just unilaterally shut down the business. 'Any current attempt to enforce our contract would ultimately require the support of Russian authorities on the ground and we know that will not practically happen anytime soon. 'This is also why you may see other brands in Russia with similar structures continue to operate in the market. 'Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today? No. 'But we want to be transparent with our actions and explain the steps we have taken to stand with the international business community in response to Russiaâs attack on Ukraine and its people.'  Restaurant Brands, who owns a minority stake of 15% in the Russian joint venture, is in the process of unwinding their business with Russia. While this process is ongoing they have stopped supporting the Burger King supply chain, operations, and their marketing in Russia, as well as rejecting new pitches for investment and expansion. Mr Shear also noted that Restaurant Brands International has donated $1million to the United Nations' Refugee Agency and has distributed another $2million in free meal coupons for the Ukrainian refugees who have fled the country. Earlier this week, the UN reported that a total of three million people fled from Ukraine in the three weeks since the war broke out. Fellow fast-food chain McDonalds in Moscow was swamped with customers desperate to get one last Big Mac before the American giant shut up shop for all its Russian restaurants last week. Hundreds of cars were seen queuing in the snow outside the fast food joint, with one witness saying the line stretched for almost 'half a mile'. The scenes came after McDonald's said it will close its 850 locations in Russia as western companies continue to pull out of the country following Vladimir Putin's devastating invasion in Ukraine that has sparked global outrage. One Russian filled his fridge with McDonald's while others sold burgers for Â£250 after the restaurant said it will close its restaurants across Russia. A photograph, shared to discussion website Reddit, showed a desperate person's fridge jam-packed with at least 50 McDonald's burgers, leaving barely any room for other groceries. A caption alongside the picture read: 'McDonald's is permanently closing in Russia here is my friend's stash.' Reacting to the post, some people said it would be a 'good business opportunity' if he tried to sell the burgers, while others jokingly questioned why he was going to the effort to stash McDonald's food. One person wrote: 'So, what you're saying is, this is a solid long term investment with no risks?' Another said: 'Could probably leave it on the shelf and it would still be good for months.' A third penned: 'If its not for personal consumption, it sure is a good business opportunity to sell stale burgers at a jacked price.' The company said it would continue paying its 62,000 employees there 'who have poured their heart and soul into our McDonald's brand.'  Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson also confirmed in a note to global staff that the iconic coffee chain would be closing its 130 locations in Russia and halting all sales, but continuing to pay its 2,000 employees there. All the shuttered cafes are run by licensed owner-operators, rather than by the Seattle-based coffee giant itself. Pepsi, one of the first Western products that was allowed in the former Soviet Union, will no longer be sold in Russia, said PepsiCo, which will continue the sale of essential items such as baby formula. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, which has a huge presence in Russia through a licensed partner that operates 10 bottling plants there, said in a statement that it is suspending all business there."
616,0,"Ontario's latest COVID-19 restrictions likely to continue past Jan. 26, top doctor warns",528 words,The Toronto Star,"""I can't guarantee the 26th,"" Moore said of the January date for lifting restrictions set by Premier Doug Ford earlier this month. ""We need as a society to continue to protect the health-care system."" Ontario's top doctor also signalled that people with compromised immune systems, including those on chemotherapy and dialysis, will qualify for fourth vaccinations starting Friday, providing they are 84 days past their third dose. While the Omicron wave could peak early next week with the number of cases levelling off, Moore said at his weekly news conference that health officials need to see hospitalizations plateauing before the province can start easing restrictions. Even then, measures would be lifted gradually, in two-week stages to measure their impact ï¿½?which means it will take time for some businesses to get back to full capacity. ""A sudden reopening, I'd be worried about another wave of Omicron,"" said Moore. It's not clear exactly when Omicron cases will level off, but when they do, it follows that a week or two later there will be peaks on hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions. The scientific director of the science table advising Ford and Moore said mobility of Ontarians is down, COVID-19 test positivity rates are down and hospital admission rates slowing, and those are all good signs. ""If we're a little bit lucky, we could start to see hospital occupancy plateauing next week,"" said Dr. Peter Juni, who stressed it is ""too early"" to ease restrictions on businesses while the province gauges the impact of reopening schools for in-class learning on Monday. The lack of widespread PCR testing to get accurate case counts makes this a ""challenging time"" to measure where the province stands, which is why health authorities are looking more closely at indications of COVID-19 levels in wastewater, he added. More modelling from the science table could be ready by the end of next week. Delays in reopening will further harm struggling businesses, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business said in calling for increased financial supports. ""This is deeply worrisome,"" president Dan Kelly said on Twitter. Ontario hit its seventh straight record of COVID-19 hospitalizations Thursday, with 3,630 patients, an increase of 182 from the previous day. There were 500 coronavirus patients in intensive care, a number that could double by the end of next week according to forecasts from the science table. Moore urged Ontarians who are eligible to get their booster shots, particularly those over 50, to help keep a lid on infection levels. ""What will take us off the rails is if we don't maintain the booster doses,"" he said. Rob Ferguson is a Toronto-based reporter covering Ontario politics for the Star.

266,0,"Report: Atlantic City casino smoking ban may cost 2,500 jobs",967 words,Associated Press Newswires,"A group of casino workers and smoking opponents criticized the report, saying it prioritizes profits over the health of employees and customers. They also said it fails to examine what would happen in subsequent years as patrons get used to a smoking ban, citing the experience of some tribal casinos where it rebounded. The Casino Association of New Jersey commissioned the report, which did not recommend whether smoking should be banned, an option that is gaining renewed support in the state Legislature. New Jersey's Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, has said he will sign [https://bit.ly/3LSBop5] a smoking ban into law if a bill is passed. Among other findings, it determined that smokers, who account for 21% of Atlantic City gamblers, are worth more to casinos than non-smokers in that they tend to lose more money and spend more on non-gambling items. Joe Lupo, president of the casino association and of Atlantic City's Hard Rock casino, said Atlantic City âfaces some very dire issues.ï¿½?He said casino employment and visitation to Atlantic City are both at 20-year lows, and in-person gambling revenue has yet to return to pre-COVID levels, down 5% in 2021 [https://bit.ly/3pak4SR] compared to 2019. âNow is not the time to enact a smoking ban,ï¿½?he said, adding that doing so âcould cause a devastating effect to the community and state.ï¿½?Nicole Vitola, a Borgata dealer and a leader of the group pushing for a smoking ban, said workers âcannot continue to choose between our health and a paycheck.ï¿½?âThis study, paid for by the casino industry, shows once again that they care more about outdated business practices than they do about the lives and health of their workers,ï¿½?she said. âCasinosï¿½?blatant disregard for our well-being is disgraceful, especially after they just received tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks from the state."" The group Americans for Non-Smokers' Rights cited a July tribal gambling conference in Las Vegas at which panelists reported that revenue lost during the first year of smoking bans rebounded in subsequent years to higher than what it was before the bans. They also cited a comment last fall from Bill Miller, president of the American Gaming Association, that some casinos have enacted smoking bans âwithout detrimental effects.ï¿½?Smoking is allowed on 25% of the casino floor in Atlantic City. The casinos claim that banning it would send smokers fleeing to neighboring Pennsylvania, where many casinos allow smoking. A group of Atlantic City casino workers, aided by national non-smoking groups, has been pushing for over a year for New Jersey to close the loophole in its public smoking law that allows it to continue in casinos; it is banned in most other indoor spaces. They complain of developing respiratory ailments and other harm from breathing second-hand smoke, despite the millions invested by casinos in filters and air purifying technology. Legislation to end casino smoking died in last year's legislative session, but has been reintroduced this year, and has garnered bipartisan support. Atlantic City banned smoking for four weeks in 2008, but dissatisfied with the results, quickly restored it to the current 25% level. In the first week of the ban, casino winnings declined [https://nyti.ms/3tjblz5] by 19.5%, according to casino workers union officials and state regulators. The report asserted that between 1,021 to 2,512 jobs could be lost in the first year of a smoking ban in Atlantic City. Spectrum used data from 2019 that found that each casino job was supported by $155,008 of gambling revenue. They also interviewed casino executives, workers and customers, and anti-smoking advocacy groups, and studied the experience of other states that have banned casino smoking. At the high end of its projections, the report says 10% of Atlantic City's casino workforce could lose their jobs if smoking is banned. It also found that with a smoking ban, non-gambling revenue would fall by up to $93 million, or 6.5%, and tax revenue would fall by up to 44%. The report also acknowledged that some non-smoking patrons would be more likely to visit casinos if smoking was banned. But the report found that the extra business would not be enough to offset an overall decline in gambling revenue. It does not expect every smoker to stop coming to Atlantic City's casinos if smoking is banned. The report predicted that smokers would constitute 13% of total visitors to the casinos, and they also have the option of gambling online. ___ Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at @WayneParryAC ___ This story was first published Feb. 23, 2022. It was updated Feb. 28, 2022, to correct that Spectrum Gaming Groupâs report predicted smokers would constitute 13% of visitors to the casinos, not that 13% of smokers would continue to patronize the cityâs casinos if a ban were enacted."

""During those six months, all the staff members went back to their hometown. It posed a bigger problem when they had to come back but the trains were not working,"" he said. During the first lockdown, restaurants in Pune had to let go of 90 to 95% of their staff, according to Ganesh Shetty, president of the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association. Sharan Shetty, president, Poona Hoteliers Association, said, ""The pandemic has been the worst time ever for workers, with most opting to leave the industry permanently. This is invariably going to affect the industry as a whole when operations do come back to normal. To get the staff back has already become a challenge."" Although the Pune civic body has allowed eateries to remain open till 1.30 am, restaurants are still struggling to stay afloat with only 50% visitors being allowed. ""Running a restaurant at 50% capacity is not viable after paying the rent fee and the tax cut. ""Restaurants have to pay rents ranging from Rs3 lakh to Rs30 lakh every month. Eighty per cent of the restaurant spaces in Pune are rented,"" said Ganesh Shetty. ""In many cases, the property owners have kept the furniture of the rent defaulters as mortgage, and cases are being fought in court. Due to rent issues and labour shortage, 30% of the restaurants have been closed,"" Ganesh Shetty said. According to Ganesh Shetty, there are 40 to 50 restaurants at High Street in Baner however 70% of them are still shut. The IT Park in Hinjewadi has around 150 to 200 restaurants. All these restaurants suffered because the IT employees were working from home. The situation is the same at Kharadi and Nagar Road. All restaurant owners have to pay an annual license fee despite not renting the restaurant for six months, said Rajesh Shetty. ""Ideally, we have to pay for six months as the restaurants were vacant for the remaining time but the government did not consider it. I have paid around 6 lakh as license fee. During the pandemic, I faced a loss of Rs3 crore,"" he said. The Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers' Association and Poona Hoteliers Association had appealed to the central and state governments for help but to no avail. ""No compensation was given by the state or central government. No relief was given to us from the banks either,"" said the president of the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers' Association.

600,1,AYSA company highlighted as one of the four most transparent agencies by Cippec,485 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"""In times of so many empty slogans and magic formulas put forward by certain sectors of the opposition, we choose to manage,"" said AYSA's president, Malena Galmarini, in a statement. ""We believe that politics is good when it is facing society, and that is what we are doing. It is no coincidence that the four companies highlighted by this report are companies led by colleagues from Frente Renovador. This look of transparency and integrity is a fundamental pillar of our way of working"", highlighted Galmarini. The research carried out highlights that the company presents a specific section of ""Information Management"" in which not only allows access to the information request form in a simple way, but also provides easy access to the procedure for claiming information that has a section of frequently asked questions on a par with a Works Plan. In addition, AYSA publishes a Gender Policy section in which, on the one hand, it presents in a synthetic and accessible way the gender policies and actions carried out by the company and, on the other hand, an annual balance sheet describing these actions and including management indicators. In line with this, and as a concrete action to strengthen the transparency and integrity policies of its management, in 2021 the company developed the ""AySA.data"" portal, which is publicly accessible and available on its institutional website. AySA.data is an initiative that is in line with the OECD's good corporate governance standards for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The policies of transparency, integrity and access to public information are key pillars of international best practices in the management of SOEs and with the Guidelines for State-Owned Majority-Owned Enterprises in force in our country. The main objective of this work is to contribute to improve the active transparency of state-owned companies, through the systematized evaluation of the quality and updating of the information published. To this end, Itepe compiles information related to 25 indicators distributed in six dimensions of analysis such as: governance, organizational structure, composition and distribution of human resources, operational functioning and economic-financial performance, among others. ""While some people talk about closing public institutions and shrinking the State, we show that when politics generates open and collaborative tools, it can undoubtedly be effective and transparent"", concluded Galmarini."

803,1,Airbnb's 135% Rally Takes IPO Crown With Room to Run; BANKING/FINANCE,514 words,Miami Daily Business Review,"And investors have more reasons to stay bullish. Airbnb's stock is expected to climb by an average of 22% over the next 12 months with a majority of the 41 analysts covering the firm recommending investors hold on to their shares or buy more, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ""It is evolving, and becoming an interesting play with respect to work-from-home and long-term rental trends,"" said Thomas George, a portfolio manager at Grizzle Investment Management, which owns the stock. ""Those are additional levers it can unlock for growth."" Brokerages on average predict the company next month will report a 64% jump in first-quarter sales. Airbnb, which was profitable on a net-income basis the past two quarters, probably lost money again in the first three months of this year, analysts say. Its revenue grew 78% to $1.53 billion in the fourth quarter, beating analysts' projections as people spread out over thousands of towns and cities and stayed for weeks and months with workers no longer having to be in traditional offices five days a week. ""The benefits seen over the past year or so are expected to continue, especially as traveling increases with the pandemic hopefully continuing to wane,"" said Scott Kessler, an analyst at Third Bridge.  Airbnb's stock performance also has given it the title of best performer of any IPO to raise $1 billion or more since its debut, according Bloomberg data. This comes at a time where weak trading in recent IPOs has weighed on the listings pipeline. At $105 billion in market value, it's now the biggest online travel company, eclipsing Booking Holdings Inc., Expedia Group Inc. and Marriott International Inc. Some caution is warranted. Its stock rally has surpassed its peers by a mile in the travel industry since it went public, which could mean its upside is minimal. Booking has climbed 5.5%, Marriott is 29% higher and Expedia is up 44% in that time period. And it isn't cheap. Airbnb sells for about 12 times its estimated sales. That's well above its peers with Booking sitting at 5.3, and both Expedia's and TripAdvisor's are below 3. To be sure, shares of Airbnb more than doubled in value in its blockbuster debut and seen a more moderate growth rate since. The company has, however, fared better than other growth stocks as the market navigated through multiple tech sell-offs."

435,0,My son says heâll lose his PUP payment if he takes up college; Your questions answered by education analyst Brian Mooney. Email askbrian@irishtimes.com,504 words,The Irish Times,"As a 2019 Leaving Cert graduate he is also in the unfortunate position of seeing his CAO points score value eroded by the calculated and accredited grade processes of 2020 and 2021. There is no way of knowing what way points requirements may develop in August 2022 but I expect them to fall back somewhat from 2021 levels. You have asked me how you might support him at this time so I will give you a couple of suggestions. Do not pressurise him with questions regarding the place he and many of his peer group find themselves in. Those of us who have lived full lives and are fortunate to have been able to retreat into the relative safety of our families during the pandemic have no real understanding what it must be like to be primed to fly the nest and be unable to do so. The key to mental health is to retain as far as possible an open, respectful relationship where the space to express the frustrations and anxieties arising from our ongoing restricted lives can be spoken about openly and freely. Useful investment A CAO application for 2022 can be made up until February 1st without any decisions having to be made on course choices until well into June. It might be a useful investment. There is also the PLC option which will remain live right up until further education colleges resume in August. He might also consider contacting his original school principal. Many guidance counsellors would be more than happy if asked by their school principal to have an online conversation with a recently graduated former student. Right now in the depths of winter his prospects may look bleak, but spring is on the way and hopefully Covid-19 has thrown its last punch. Hopefully, we can look to your son and his compatriots to reimagine and create our post-pandemic world. NÃ­ neart go cur le chÃ©ile."

293,1,Biden administration announces it will resume onshore oil and gas lease sales with higher royalty rate,729 words,CNN Wire,"The Biden administration had previously planned to hold the lease sale, but paused it after a judge blocked the administration [https://www-cnn-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/2022/02/21/us/biden-climate-social-cost-of-carbon-court/index.html] from using a metric to quantify the economic harm caused by the climate crisis, such as sea level rise, more destructive hurricanes, extreme wildfire seasons and flooding. The Biden administration appealed that ruling and argued it necessitated a pause on all of the many projects in which the government used that particular analysis. The royalty rate increase comes after the Interior Department issued a controversial report [https://www-cnn-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/2022/03/22/politics/climate-groups-sue-interior-drilling-report-climate/index.html] last November recommending that rates be increased [https://www-cnn-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/2021/11/26/politics/interior-department-federal-review-oil-gas-leasing/index.html] for more of a return to taxpayers. The newly increased royalty rate is 18.75%, up from of 12.5%. It's the first time the federal government has ever increased what companies pay to drill for oil and gas on public land. ""For too long, the federal oil and gas leasing programs have prioritized the wants of extractive industries above local communities, the natural environment, the impact on our air and water, the needs of tribal nations, and, moreover, other uses of our shared public lands,"" Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement, adding the department would ""begin to reset how and what we consider to be the highest and best use of Americans' resources."" The bureau will offer around 173 parcels on roughly 144,000 acres of federal land, which Interior said is an 80% reduction from the acreage originally being considered for leasing. Interior said it reduced the amount of land being offered after ""robust environmental review"" and engagement with Native tribes and local communities. The department also said it would focus on offering new leases near existing oil and gas infrastructure and will continue to disclose greenhouse gas emissions that would result from oil and gas drilling on federal lands. Environmental groups blasted the move, saying the Biden administration is disregarding its promises on the climate crisis [http://www.cnn.com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/2022/04/04/world/un-ipcc-climate-report-mitigation-fossil-fuels/index.html]. ""The Biden administration's claim that it must hold these lease sales is pure fiction and a reckless failure of climate leadership,"" Randi Spivak, public lands director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. ""These so-called reforms are 20 years too late and will only continue to fuel the climate emergency. These lease sales should be shelved and the climate-destroying federal fossil fuel programs brought to an end."" Natasha Leger, executive director of Citizens for a Healthy Community, said restarting the lease sales will only lead to more climate disasters. ""The West is drying up and going up in flames. Between extreme drought, the shrinking of the Colorado River, and now urban wildfires in the winter, how much more death, destruction and devastation do we have to see before this administration takes action?"" said Leger. ""It's time for climate leadership and to stop leasing our public lands for oil and gas development. We need heroes to break through the political and economic inertia that has us on a collision course to inhabitability."" Varshini Prakash, the executive director of Sunrise Movement, said ""it's never a good sign when the President announces something at 5pm on a Friday."" ""This is why young people are doubting the political process altogether,"" Prakash said in a statement. ""If Biden wants to solve for voter turnout in 2022, he should actually deliver on the things he promised, not move farther away from them."" A representative for the American Petroleum Institute, a powerful oil lobby, welcomed the action in a statement but said it didn't go far enough toward opening the country's federal land to drilling. ""At a time of high energy costs, these changes to long-standing fair and reasonable lease terms may further discourage oil and natural gas investment on federal lands,"" said Frank Macchiarola, the institute's senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs. ""We look forward to seeing the additional details of the leasing proposal."" This story has been updated with additional information. By Ella Nilsen, CNN"

101,1,AFTERPAYâS BUBBLE BURSTS,1092 words,The Australian,"In WeWorkâs case the âsomeoneï¿½?was private investors, specifically Japanese tech investor SoftBank, pushing the start-upâs valuation to $US47bn ($63.5bn). For Australiaâs Afterpay, which was valued at $39bn in August, the âsomeoneï¿½?was Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter and now head of the payments play now called Block. The share-based acquisition of Afterpay last August signalled top of the market for buy now, pay later, and had Block investors waited a few months as interest rates started climbing around the world, they would have got a bargain. Rising competition, interest rates and inflation are taking their toll on the one-time darlings. At the time of the Afterpay deal, the buyout ï¿½?which was funded by using 0.375 Block shares ï¿½?was valued at $39bn, marking Australiaâs biggest ever M&A deal. The equivalent transaction today would have valued Afterpay at $18.3bn, as Blockâs shares fell more than 56 per cent after it was announced. It is arguable that had the merger been struck a few months later, Block could have used tougher terms, resulting in an even lower valuation. In February the smaller Zip Co snapped up BNPL rival Sezzle for $491m, struck on numbers nowhere near the lofty Afterpay deal. Today that all-share Sezzle merger is worth just $239.4m Updated accounts released by the Wall Street-listed Block in recent days put Afterpay in a different light under its new San Francisco-based owner. The merger has triggered tougher accounting treatment and forced a string of revaluations. Itâs also given an insight into the deepening losses of the BNPL pioneer. Consolidated accounts show Afterpay delivered a pre-tax loss of $501.9m for the six months to end-December. This compares to a $76.1m pre-tax loss for the same period a year earlier.  Afterpayâs revenue increased 54 per cent during the half to $644.9m. But all the gains in revenue were wiped out by a bigger increase in operating costs, including a more-than-doubling of expenses ($176.7m) for bad debts during the December half. Itâs worth noting for all of last financial year ï¿½?that is for the entire 12 months ï¿½?Afterpay took $194.9m in bad debt expenses, showing momentum for lending losses is on the rise. As interest rates increase rapidly around the world this is going to deliver a twin blow for BNPL. Financing costs and bad debts are set to go up sharply, increasing the cash burn rate of the businesses. As weâve written before, one of the major issues with the BNPL model comes down to sustainability: the faster the growth, the bigger the losses become. And Afterpay and its smaller rival Sezzle are the most vulnerable because their revenue mostly relies on merchant fees for revenue. Comparable rivals Affirm and Klarna generate significant net interest income, which can help them navigate higher rates. The Block accounts reveal National Australia Bank and Citi have provided the biggest line of credit to Afterpay, with a combined $1.9bn in warehousing facilities in Australia alone to fund its BNPL payments. In the US Wall Street banks Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have a combined $1bn. This includes a $266m facility that needs to be rolled over in December. Block was at pains to point out that the unaudited results to end-December were presented for informational purposes only and are not intended to be indicative of the actual financial position of Â­Afterpay. But itâs a picture of a very different business from 12 months ago. As long as Blockâs shareholders can handle the losses, merging with a pure-play payments business was actually the lifeline that Afterpay needed. The rationale remains to incorporate Afterpay into Blockâs Seller and Cash App, essentially becoming the payments link between merchants and consumers. This could ultimately represent bigger value to Block shareholders rather than operating Afterpay as a stand-alone business, but it will require deep pockets. Itâs just as well Jack Dorsey resigned from the microblogging site last November to focus his efforts on Block, which he jointly ran. Otherwise he would have his work cut out fending off a $US43bn takeover approach for Twitter from Tesla founder Elon Musk, rather than bringing Afterpay together. Dorsey remains on the board of Twitter, which is weighing up Muskâs approach. Brokerage Macquarie has been tracking the BNPL sector for some time and is now starting to see plenty of red flags, particularly around the rates of growth for the sector. One measure that Macquarie tracks includes website visits, which is a key driver of customers signing up. Total web traffic across six major BNPL players, including Afterpay, fell during March from the same time a year earlier ï¿½?the first time that growth has fallen. The outlook for web traffic growth remains uncertain as inflation flows through markets, which could dampen spending and potentially BNPL transactions. At the same time Afterpay has been showing slower merchant growth globally, which âmay be a leading indicator the industry is beginning to matureï¿½? Macquarie says. Itâs almost a year since the talks between Jack Dorsey and Afterpayâs co-founders began. From May 17 there were two days of talks with the Block boss and his payments executives Brian Grassadonia and Alyssa Henry. Molnar attended the talks in person in San Francisco while Eisen participated by videoconferences. The talks included an outline of the future of both companies and were left at a point where Block needed to conduct preliminary due diligence before pushing ahead with a deal. It was at this meeting that Molnar and Eisen agreed to remain with Block, leading the payments business if a deal went ahead. Terms of a deal and due diligence were settled in just two months. By holding on just a few months longer would have seen a very different outcome in valuation. As it stands the one time buy now, pay later darling will have to start delivering for Dorsey. johnstone@theaustralian.com.au"
830,1,DGAP-Adhoc: SÃ¼dzucker expects significant earnings increase in the first quarter of the current 2022/23 financial year,757 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"Positive initial outlook for full fiscal 2022/23 despite Ukraine war After a very positive start to fiscal 2022/23, SÃ¼dzucker AG expects EBITDA and operating result for the first quarter of fiscal 2022/23 (1 March to 31 May 2022) to be significantly higher than last year's levels (Q1 2021/22: EBITDA: EUR 121 million; operating result: EUR 49 million). For fiscal 2022/23 as a whole, SÃ¼dzucker expects group revenues of EUR 8.7 to 9.1 (2021/22 year: 7.6) billion. We see EBITDA in a range of EUR 660 to 760 (2021/22: 692) million and consolidated operating result in a range of EUR 300 to 400 (2021/22: 332) million. The war in Ukraine, which has been ongoing since the beginning of the 2022/23 financial year, has further intensified the already high volatility on the sales markets and price increases on the procurement markets. The resulting economic and financial impact and the duration of this temporary exceptional situation, in addition to the Corona pandemic, are difficult to assess. In addition, the risks associated with the Corona pandemic continue to exist. The forecast for the first quarter and the full year is based on the assumption that the Ukraine war will remain temporary and regionally limited, that the physical supply of energy and raw materials is guaranteed and that the sales and procurement markets will partially normalize during fiscal 2022/23. In this context, SÃ¼dzucker's expected transfer of the significantly higher prices, especially in the raw material and energy sectors, into new customer contracts will be of decisive importance. The annual report for fiscal 2021/22 - including detailed forecast for fiscal 2022/23 - will be published on 19 May 2022, and the quarterly report for the first quarter of fiscal 2022/23 on 7 July 2022.

178,0,McDonald's closes its 850 restaurants in Russia,251 words,Khaama Press,"CEO Chris Kempczinski wrote in a letter to franchisees and employees that the chain will pause all operations in Russia. However, it will continue to pay its 62,000 Russian employees, and its Ronald McDonald House Charities will continue to operate. In recent days, the fast-food giant has drawn criticism for staying silent on the war, given its relatively large Russian footprint.  McDonald's restaurants in Russia and Ukraine account for 2% of its systemwide sales, roughly 9% of its revenue, and 3% of its operating income.  McDonald's has long played a symbolic role in Russia as well. The chain opened its first location in the Soviet Union 32 years ago in Moscow, months before the state collapsed. About 84% of McDonald's Russian locations are owned by the company, while the rest are operated by franchisees. Owning more of its restaurants generates greater revenue for the company, but opens it up to greater risk in times of turmoil or economic downturn.

124,0,Omicron forces China lockdown,448 words,The Toronto Star,"Even as countries in the West are now loosening or abandoning mask mandates and other measures, Chinese officials are implementing some of their most stringent methods. That is in large part because China can't afford to lift restrictions. The government has been concerned about comparatively lower rates of vaccination among China's older adults. The country also has far fewer intensive care hospital beds compared to its population than most industrialized countries. In China's vast rural areas, hospitals and medical facilities are often basic, and a major outbreak could quickly overwhelm hospitals. The United States and other Western countries have suffered far higher rates of infection and deaths over the past two years than China and still have higher rates now. But the seven-day average rate of new cases in mainland China, now at 1,584, has more than quintupled in recent days. For many residents in China, the rapid spread of the virus has been unsettling. ""Because of the large number of cases in a short period of time, it is inevitable that there will be some panic all over the country, and Shanghai is no exception,"" Dr. Zhang Wenhong, a prominent infectious disease expert in Shanghai, said in a social media post Monday. China has responded to the current surge in cases by mobilizing its vast Communist Party apparatus to deploy workers and resources. In Jilin province, where many cases have been recorded, workers are building temporary facilities to house thousands of people who test positive. Across the country, workers are corralling and testing millions of citizens every day. But that testing program is starting to be overwhelmed. China's virus containment strategy is focused on moving quickly to lock down buildings or neighbourhoods. In response to even a single case, officials may seal all the entrances to a store, office building or even convention centre. Everyone inside must then stay there for up to several days as they are tested for the coronavirus and sent into isolation if their results are positive.  The New York Times"

541,0,DMZ: What itâs like to visit the North Korean border,888 words,Independent Online,"Until I remembered that along with a clause accepting my potential impending death and the presence of landmines all around me, I had signed away the right to take any photographs that pointed in the direction of North Korea. On a whim, on the back of a glitzy weekend filled with beauty products and barbecues in skyscraper-ringed Seoul, I had decided to spend my last afternoon in the country on a tour of Koreaâs Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) ï¿½?between South and North Korea. In stark contrast to the violent restrictions on every step taken by a human being, red-spotted deer and brown bears roam freely in the untouched 2.5-mile wide stretch of land that runs across the length of this divided peninsula ï¿½?one which remains the worldâs last Cold War border. Our tour set off from Seoul on a cool spring afternoon to Panmunjom. Known colloquially as the âtruce villageï¿½? it is where the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, and is where Kim Jong-un became the first North Korean leader to cross into South Korean territory back in 2018, walking over the Military Demarcation Line to meet President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. Before this historic moment, back when I was there in 2016, I found it oppressively quiet, with only the chatter from my tour group and the occasional bird cry breaking the silence. Eerily, although it is quiet, there are people everywhere, with troops mere feet away from each other in their dark brown uniforms, clutching guns the size of children and staring stonily ahead of them. On the North Korean side, behind the soldiers is a double line of tall, chainlink fences topped with razor wire. And behind these defences are endless rows of bunkers and strong points guarded by North Korean troops in mirrored sunglasses ï¿½?who we were not to engage with or provoke under any circumstances, we were told. No laughing, joking or gesturing ï¿½?we must be silent too. Our tour moved onto Unification Hill, which gives visitors a 360-degree view of the Korean peninsula. The weak spring sunlight bounced off the mirrored skyscrapers of Seoul to the south, but turning north, the Songaksan Mountain across the border looked bleak and empty bar a few old fashioned-looking villages. Through the binoculars, I could see North Koreans going about their day. Men in 1950s workwear pushed carts up the hill and children played in the muddy fields. The village is also a clear symbol of the countryâs patriotism; home to a flagpole that stands 525 feet high, which makes it one of the tallest on earth. That it felt voyeuristic goes without saying. But it also felt disconcerting to look casually in to such a violent world ï¿½?one that I have read so much about but have rarely seen captured on screen. As I stood there in my London-bought clothes, I felt like I was peeking into apartheid-era South Africa or the former Soviet Union. The ability to see deep into both countries at the same time is widely believed to be a powerful message for reunification ï¿½?hence the name Unification Hill. But as I watched the ant-like figures of the North Koreans going about their day, trapped in the most repressive regime on earth, I questioned why on earth I was there. There is an argument that DMZ tourism can help in reunification efforts ï¿½?one that my South Korean tour group leader was forceful about. The majority of young Koreans have never known their peninsula to be united. Seeing their counterparts on the other side of a razorwire wall can, the belief goes, only help bring them closer together. It is a stance shared by politicians: in January 2022, South Korean presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung pledged to[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/north-korea-dmz-dark-tourism-b1995215.html] âreopen the doors of tourism to Mount Kumgang as soon as possible.ï¿½?The resort has been closed for almost 15 years, ever since a 53-year-old South Korean female tourist was shot dead by a North Korean guard there in 2008. However, I found visiting the DMZ served only to indicate how divided the country remained. A line of bright blue huts sits between the North and South Korean troops, who stare at each other with an aggression that is so tangible you can almost taste it. One can only hope that future tourism efforts might help take the threat of violence down a notch or two.

140,0,Former user recalls secret drug parties held in S'pore hotel rooms,1229 words,The Straits Times,"The parties were often organised by children of wealthy families, including expatriates. They are young and loaded - slang for rich and also for being under the influence of drugs. There would be alcohol and music at the events, while some would retreat to a corner to use drugs. Most people at the parties Adam attended were under 30. He went through periods where he would be at one every weekend, with some hosted in expensive hotels and condominiums and others at Housing Board flats. Some of these parties were organised entirely around drugs, where all partygoers would be partaking; others involved alcohol and other activities with just a few people taking drugs. At one such party in 2019 in Fajar Road, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) arrested seven teenagers - aged between 13 and 18. Some of these drug parties have ended in tragedy. In 2018, a 19-year-old medical student from the National University of Singapore died after taking 25B-NBOMe, a new psychoactive substance that is a modified version of lysergic acid diethylamide, more commonly known as LSD or acid. He had attended a ""trip"" party, a term used to describe getting high. A polytechnic student who organised the illicit gathering was later charged. The drugs are not cheap. During the pandemic, the price of MDMA, a psychoactive drug commonly known as Ecstasy or Molly, went up to $80 a pill from $50 a pill. Other drugs such as ketamine went up to $130 to $200 a gram, from $80 to $100 a gram. More On This Topic S'pore youth more likely to perceive cannabis as not harmful Work needed to prevent the young from becoming next generation of drug abusers: Faishal Adam said he rarely met drug dealers himself, but he was always in contact with people who knew them. Encrypted messaging apps are a popular platform. Checks by ST last year showed that on 20 Telegram chat groups selling drugs and drug paraphernalia, most had about 300 to 500 members while a few had more than 2,400 members. After payment is made, sellers would leave the drugs with runners or at drop-off points. Between Jan 2019 and Sept 17 last year, the Central Narcotics Bureau arrested 77 traffickers linked to Telegram transactions. Adam, now 23 and doing his national service, said he would often gather with groups of close friends - a collection of both Singaporeans and expats and children of expats - to use substances like cannabis and MDMA. The phenomenon of drug use among Singapore's international community and some wealthy people here has surfaced in the news from time to time. In 2019, the scion of a rich business family in Singapore pleaded guilty to cannabis possession and consumption. He was sentenced to a jail term of two years and two months. He started smoking marijuana at 21, while studying overseas, and continued the habit on his return to Singapore. Adam started at an even younger age. He was 14 when he first smoked marijuana. A group of friends from secondary school had offered it to him at the playground of a condominium where one of them lived. He said he started doing drugs to deal with anxiety and attention deficit hyperactive disorder and later switched to harder drugs. ""As cliched as it sounds, every drug I've done later was for the thrill of finding the next high. I was 15 when I tried acid, 18 when I started using benzos, 20 when I did my first line of cocaine, ketamine and MDMA."" Benzos is short for benzodiazepines, a class of psychoactive drugs used to treat depression or anxiety, which he has been diagnosed with. Adam said his parents - his father works in drug rehabilitation - were suspicious. But he continued to do relatively well in school and earned himself a diploma. So they trusted him. He said he was influenced by what he watched and read. After reading The Perks Of Being A Wallflower by American writer Stephen Chbosky, Adam wanted to be Bob. Bob was a stereotypical stoner, a character in the American coming-of-age book where several teenage characters use drugs such as marijuana and LSD. ""I did acid for the first time because I was stupid, didn't know better and thought I was the main character in Skins."" Skins is a British TV show that also explores teenage drug use. More On This Topic Young people continue to make up majority of first-time drug abusers; 3 in 5 aged below 30 LSD ensnares several tertiary students in S'pore in recent years But escapism from emotional trauma was also at the root of his addiction. When he was a child, he was sexually assaulted by his sister, who is now in jail for a separate offence involving drug trafficking. He said the drugs were not just recreational but also a coping mechanism for pain which he felt therapy could not solve, especially during a period of about 10 months beginning in March 2020. He said: ""(During) my worst spiral and drug bender, Molly was my drug of choice."" He would pop pills every weekend and also tried to end his life several times. While his first contact with drugs was through his friends, it was also his social group that got him out of hard drugs, he said. He said: ""My friends saw how much I was spiralling and we all decided to stay sober together and cut ourselves off from people who dealt (drugs)."" Adam added that while he agrees with Singapore's hard stance against drugs, he is concerned that it may drive people to consume whatever they can get their hands on. He said: ""I think drugs are bad and do a lot of harm to families and the community. But it's not going to stop the young from trying drugs at a party or a rave.""

302,0,"Bankruptcy very rarely erases student loans. Even when it does, the US government has put up a fight",3250 words,USA Today Online,"Days after a bankruptcy judge ruled in Wolfson's favor to erase his loans, the Biden administration filed a notice of appeal to U.S. District Court, putting up a final fight without explaining why. When advocates for borrowers of student loans griped and Wolfson's case generated news coverage, the Department of Education quickly dropped the appeal Feb. 4, saying in a tweet it would review future cases. âAt that moment, I was really, really upset,ï¿½?Wolfson told USA TODAY. âI was like, âWhy are they doing this to me again?âï¿½?Far-right fundraising: Mimicking Donald Trump, far-right lawmakers use personal celebrity to draw in donors Four days after dropping Wolfson's appeal, the administration filed a notice of appeal in a similar case. Monique Wheat, a single mother of three from Alabama, represented herself in bankruptcy court, where a judge ruled her $111,000 in student debt would be forgiven. At one point during the case, Justice Department lawyers suggested her then-13-year-old son might be able to get a job at 14 to add to the household income. The government dropped its appeal Feb. 11 ï¿½?again, without explanation. More: Do you have student debt? Here are ways to get loan forgiveness under new federal rules Despite President Joe Biden's campaign vow to ease the burden on people who owe student loans, federal lawyers across the U.S. continue to challenge bankruptcy rulings for some of the most desperate borrowers, who meet a high legal standard to have their debt forgiven. The challenges persist even though Biden administration officials acknowledge the legal hurdles to wipe out debt are too strict in the first place. The scope of the problem is staggering. About 250,000 people with student loans declare bankruptcy each year. But only about 1 in 1,000 are able to wipe out education debt, which requires proof the debt imposes an ""undue hardship."" The legal hurdles discourage many student borrowers from even trying. Cases like Wolfson's and Wheat's also reveal Biden's complicated history with student loans. In his 36 years in the Senate, Biden repeatedly joined big majorities in Congress making it harder to erase student loans through bankruptcy. But Biden also pledged relief for student borrowers during the 2020 campaign, including rolling back some of the bankruptcy laws he helped pass. Bankruptcy attorneys and judges, student loan advocates and senior Democratic lawmakers say the bankruptcy standards for student loans ï¿½?which are higher than other forms of debt ï¿½?are too burdensome. ""Itâs crushing too many people right now,"" said Ed Boltz, a bankruptcy lawyer in Durham, N.C., told USA TODAY. Richard Cordray, chief operating officer for the U.S. Department of Educationâs office of Federal Student Aid, told a House panel in October the bankruptcy process doesn't work well and needs to be overhauled. He said the Education and Justice departments would review policies where people âare forced to go into court, if you can imagine such a thing, and recount how miserable their lives are, in order to beg for some kind of bankruptcy relief and rarely get it.ï¿½?""I think that it doesn't work well, and we think that it needs to be reformed and reevaluated, and we are committed to doing that,"" Cordray said. But Cordray didn't explain why the government pursues appeals in cases like that of Wolfson's and Wheat's. Government and private lenders regularly appeal when student loans are discharged in cases that aren't settled before trial, according to bankruptcy lawyers and professors. Meanwhile, student debt continues to grow on a larger scale. About 43 million borrowers owe about $1.6 trillion, according to Education Department statistics. The Trump administration suspended loan payments in March 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic, and Biden has extended the suspension until May 1. But the number of people seeking relief from student loans before the pandemic was enormous, and the debt continues to mount despite the payment moratorium. Student loans to be repaid: $415 million of federal loan money sent to students defrauded by DeVry, ITT Tech It's harder to wipe out student loans in bankruptcy than other debt Wolfson and Wheat are two of the few people who succeeded in canceling their education debt through bankruptcy. About 300 debtors a year get relief from student loans in bankruptcy court out of about 250,000 who filed, according to estimates from Jason Iuliano, an associate professor of law at the University of Utah, whose figures based on court records are supported by legal experts in the field. More: Do you have student debt? Here are ways to get loan forgiveness under new federal rules The low success rate is because the process for wiping out student debt through bankruptcy requires an extra legal step, a filing to prove ""undue hardship,"" which most student debtors often don't take because of the legal challenges and cost. The prevailing court precedent that defined undue hardship in 1987 was called Brunner vs. New York Higher Education Services Corp. The Brunner case created a three-pronged test to qualify for forgiveness: the debtor must be unable to maintain a minimal standard of living, the situation is likely to persist and the debtor must have made a good-faith effort to repay the loan. Student loan forgiveness: Student loan forgiveness has arrived for 70,000 borrowers working public service jobs Government lawyers typically challenge student loan cases by arguing that even if finances are dire when a case is filed, the borrower could eventually find a better job and repay the loan. The cases put the debtor in the position of arguing against the success of their own future employment. Boltz said the Education Department and the nonprofit Educational Credit Management Corp., which collects student loans, ""always wage a scorched-earth war on student loans."" ""They want everybody to know itâs not going to be easy"" to get out of their loans, Boltz told USA TODAY. ""Itâs going to be very difficult."" How it got so difficult can be traced to Congress. Over the years, Biden and Congress toughened student loan forgiveness laws Congress steadily made it harder to discharge student loans through bankruptcy over decades, and Biden supported at least five of those incremental changes in the Senate. Wolfson and Wheat faced the culmination of those legal hurdles in their cases. The changes began in 1976 to prevent anyone from filing for bankruptcy within five years of graduation unless they could prove undue hardship. A series of other changes in 1979, 1990, 1998 and 2005 eventually extended the undue hardship standard to all student loans no matter when they were filed. âSen. Biden was not very easy on student loans,"" said Boltz, the bankruptcy lawyer who called the current undue hardship standard ""really, really draconian and brutal."" âItâs been applied far, far harsher than it ever could have or should have,"" Boltz said. How Congress tightened bankruptcy laws affecting student loans with Biden's support Without singling out student debtors, Biden argued at a February 2001 hearing that âsomethingâs rotten in Denmarkï¿½?because so many people were declaring bankruptcy during a booming economy. âAn awful lot of people are discharging debt that shouldn't,ï¿½?Biden said. âSomething's going on here. And it says to me it's got to be tightened.ï¿½?Biden said during a March 2020 presidential debate on CNN that he didn't like the 2005 legislation but that he worked with Republicans to improve it. One of the bill's provisions required undue hardship to wipe out private student loans in addition to government loans. At the time, he was campaigning against Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who proposed to forgive $50,000 in student loans for each borrower and eliminate the onerous undue hardship standard. ""I did not like the rest of the bill, but I improved it,"" Biden said of the 2005 measure. Biden pledged during the campaign to ""end the absurd rules that make it nearly impossible to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy."" He also campaigned for ""an immediate cancellation of a minimum of $10,000 of student debt per person."" But lawyers and student advocates doubt Biden will overhaul bankruptcy law. ""He had no intention of doing that,"" Austin Smith, a New York bankruptcy lawyer, told USA TODAY. ""He has instructed his Department of Education to fight these things tooth and nail, which I think is really unforgivable."" Pamela Foohey, a bankruptcy law professor at Cardozo Law School in New York, said potential administration changes in how bankruptcy cases should be handled should happen more urgently. ""I think they could work faster,"" Foohey told USA TODAY. ""Itâs been too long."" At his January news conference, Biden breezed past a question about forgiving $10,000 per borrower in student debt but has said he would sign legislation if Congress approves it. Student loan payment pause: Biden extends federal student loan payment pause through May 1 Trapped under six-digit debts The White House and the Department of Education did not explain why they appealed in Wolfson's and Wheat's cases or why they dropped the efforts in both cases days later. For Wolfson, the bankruptcy filing came after a decade scrambling for minimum wage jobs and driving gigs. Career options dwindled as years passed without a 9-to-5 job and his cannabis use to treat epilepsy prevented him from taking work requiring a drug test, he said. âIâve been fighting battles my whole life when the odds are stacked against me,"" Wolfson said. ""To me, does it make it hard? Yes. But does it scare me from fighting that battle? No.ï¿½?More: Thousands of student loans to be canceled in $1.85 billion Navient settlement. Many more borrowers can expect $260. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurie Selber Silverstein ruled Jan. 14 that Wolfson faced undue hardship from the debt. âSince graduating from college, this debtor could not afford a modest apartment, food to eat or basic transportation without the assistance of his father,ï¿½?Silverstein wrote in her decision. âIt is not for lack of work ethic. His assortment of jobs, even while working full time, did not permit repayment of his student loans. As there is no evidence to suggest his plight will improve, Wolfson is entitled to a discharge.ï¿½?Education Secretary Miguel Cardona filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. District Court in Delaware on Jan. 28. But a week later, Cardona dropped the appeal without explanation. ""Beyond our notice to withdraw, we have no additional details to share,"" said Kim Reeves, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Delaware. The same thing happened to Wheat, who at 32 was raising three children ages 8 to 12 in a federally subsidized apartment, according to court records. She filed for bankruptcy in 2018, when her monthly expenses totaled $2,954 and her net income was $1,876, according to court records. Wheat had accumulated about $111,000 in student loan debt while earning a bachelorâs degree in criminal justice from Troy University and attending a masterâs program in clinical counseling at Bellevue University, according to court records. But Wheat, who tends to her mother's and daughter's health ailments, was unable to find a job in her field and earned $10.50 an hour a few days a week at a nearby medical center, according to court records. The Justice Department, representing the Education Department, opposed her by arguing her situation didn't represent a ""certainty of hopelessness."" U.S. Bankruptcy Judge William Sawyer rejected the government's arguments and ruled Jan. 25 that Wheat faced undue hardship from the debt. The Education Department filed a notice of appeal to U.S. District Court on Feb. 8 before withdrawing it three days later. More: Student loan forgiveness has arrived for 70,000 borrowers working public service jobs Iuliano, who researches bankruptcy cases, said few student loan rulings are appealed because the vast majority are settled. Iuliano and bankruptcy lawyers say the settlements are part of a strategy by creditors to avoid a precedent that would embolden others to pursue student loan forgiveness in bankruptcy. Smith said creditors have gone so far as to appeal cases involving paraplegics living on state assistance. âI have never seen them not appeal,"" Smith said. âItâs almost like a mafia tactic so people on the street donât think theyâre weak."" Pressed about Wolfsonâs case and student loan debt in recent press briefings, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki deferred to the federal agencies, reiterated Biden's willingness to erase $10,000 in debt and pointed out he has forgiven student loans in specific cases such as for students with permanent disabilities or when a school goes defunct. âThe president has forgiven $15 billion in student loans benefiting more than 675,000 student loan borrowers since he took office,"" Psaki said in response to a question from USA TODAY. ""No one has been required to pay a single dime in federal student loans. And he extended the hiatus of payment until May to give people some extra breathing room.ï¿½?The Education Department said in a brief statement that itâs working with the Justice Department âto explore legal pathways to delivering targeted relief to borrowers."" Wolfson's case was provocative enough to draw the attention of a top Education Department official and national news stories. James Kvaal, the undersecretary of education, said in a tweet the day the appeal was dropped that the department would review how future claims are handled. Signs of pushback from judges Legal experts say there are signs judges are beginning to push back against creditors in student loan cases, as seen in cases such as Wolfson's and Wheat's. In a New York case, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Cecelia Morris railed against the âmythsï¿½?that debtors canât erase their student loans through bankruptcy court because of how the Brunner standard has been applied. Her 2020 ruling wiped out $221,385 in student loan debt for Kevin Rosenberg of Beacon, New York. He had earned a bachelorâs degree at the University of Arizona in 1996 and a law degree from Cardozo Law School in 2004, sandwiched around two stints in the Navy. Rosenberg left the legal profession quickly to open a business selling camping equipment in Brooklyn, which he said yielded more than $100,000 in income some years. But the business suffered and he filed for bankruptcy in 2018, when he was earning about $1,500 per month less than expenses while still facing huge debt. âIf those loans are allowed to stand, I have no chance at having a life,"" Rosenberg told USA TODAY. ""Iâm basically just an indentured servant working to pay off my loans and never actually benefitting from them."" In discharging Rosenbergâs student loans, Morris found interpretations of the Brunner case yielded ""harsh"" results because judges treated the standards as ""punitive."" Not just the Supreme Court: Biden poised to triple number of Black women on federal appeals courts âBrunner has received a lot of criticism for creating too high of a burden for most bankruptcy petitioners to meet,ï¿½?Morris said in her ruling. âThe court will not participate in perpetuating these myths.ï¿½?The Educational Credit Management Corp., which took over collection of Roseberg's payments, appealed her decision to the U.S. District Court, which sent the case back to Morris for a full trial that is still pending. New York Attorney General Letitia James filed an argument supporting Rosenberg in the case by arguing the legal regime and practical experience had changed in the decades since the Brunner test, with ""vastly increased"" student debt that led to ""a nationwide crisis in student debt."" âI think they appeal everything just to scare people as well,"" Rosenberg said of student loan creditors. How could student loan bankruptcies change? Lawmakers have urged more action on loan forgiveness and on a bankruptcy overhaul, but disagree about which steps to take. Congress' top-ranking Democrats, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi disagree over whether Biden has the authority to forgive even $10,000 in federal debt for each borrower. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, said âmeaningful progressï¿½?was still possible this year. The Judiciary Committee chairman said the Education Department could take administrative steps to change its approach to contesting bankruptcy cases involving student loans. âThe student debt crisis demands action, both from Congress and from the Department of Education,ï¿½?Durbin told USA TODAY. âItâs become clear that current bankruptcy law, which requires a nearly impossible showing of âundue hardshipï¿½?to obtain student loan relief, simply does not work.ï¿½?Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who heads the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, supported a bankruptcy bill spearheaded by Durbin, which aimed to clarify undue hardship and to remove the undue hardship requirement for private student loans. She also supported forgiving $10,000 in loans per borrower. âRight now, student loan borrowers are struggling under the burden of student debt and they need relief,ï¿½?Murray told USA TODAY in a statement. More: Biden, Congress and student loan forgiveness: What is the federal government doing to address the issue? But Rafael Pardo, a professor at Emory Law School who specializes in bankruptcy law, said change in the undue hardship standard would have to come from bankruptcy courts because Congress is unlikely to act. Creditors have greater economic resources to fight changes than nonprofit groups that advocate for borrowers, he said. As the administration reviews its options, bankruptcy law professors and lawyers who represent people with student loans have proposed the department not automatically challenge bankruptcy relief for student loans. Smith, the bankruptcy lawyer, suggested turning back the bankruptcy clock decades so that debtors would erase student loans after five years without proving undue hardship. ""I think the term is just fundamentally rotten at this point,"" Smith said. ""There are enough negative side effects of bankruptcy that being discouraged is already built into it."" More: Online college accused of recruiting unprepared students, pocketing money ï¿½?despite sanctions Another option would be for the department to acquiesce on bankruptcies with smaller amounts of student loans, such as $5,000 or $7,500, because the cost of litigation could outweigh those amounts. âWhatever has been going on, itâs a political question,"" Dalie Jimenez, who studies bankruptcy law as a professor at UC Irvine and as director of the Student Loan Law Initiative. âIt is still very frustrating."" This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Bankruptcy very rarely erases student loans. Even when it does, the US government has put up a fight"
312,0,"Police cannot force eateries to close down early, says HC",538 words,The Hindu Online,"Disapproving of such insistence on the part of the police, the judge wrote: âItâs a shame and highly deplorable that being the enforcers of the law and the protectors of the people, the police, instead of taking stringent action against anti-social elements in order to protect the interests of the writ petitioner, are unfortunately insisting upon the petitioner to close his eatery by 10.30 p.m.ï¿½?He went on to observe: âThe Latin proverb ï¿½?aegrescit medendoï¿½?means the cure is worse than the disease. The present writ petition presents the same scenario, indicating the restrictive and narrow approach adopted by the police.ï¿½?The judge pointed out that many people, including the food delivery executives, run around day and night for their work and end up finding time to eat only at odd hours. âA restaurant open a little late at night serves as a huge sigh of relief for their hungry stomachs. To anticipate that some unruly or anti-social elements might visit these restaurants/eateries/hotels, and therefore, directing them to be closed down and not open late at night is neither rational nor logical. Yet, the police appear to be issuing oral instructions to close down the eateries,ï¿½?the judge lamented. While doing so, the police ended up infringing upon the Constitutional right of the eatery owners to carry on their business as per the law and also the fundamental right of the consumers to eat food, a part and parcel of the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, he added. The police could not force eateries to shut down simply because they apprehend a law and order problem, he said. The judge recalled that eateries and restaurants had to obtain a licence from the Police Department, under the Chennai City Police Act, only prior to an amendment made in September 2007. Post-amendment, the power of the police had been restricted to issuance of no objection certificates alone and that too only with respect to objections if any with regard to road traffic in the locality. Further, the State government had in May 2019 issued an order permitting all shops and establishments to remain open 24 hours on all seven days of a week. Therefore, the power to fix timings for commercial establishments rests only with the government, he concluded."
248,0,Cuban Black Bean Soup,570 words,The Boston Globe,"Yet the soup is nothing fancy. Onions, garlic, green pepper, oregano, cumin, and a dash of vinegar flavor the black beans, which cook slowly in water. If the dried beans do not soften, the culprit is probably old beans. Salting the pot at the beginning of cooking will not prevent them from softening, contrary to anecdotal advice. While most dried beans need to be soaked in water overnight, black beans are the exception to that rule. They will take 1 1/2 to 2 hours to cook but the initial prep is minimal. The result is tender beans that hold their shape in a creamy dark broth. The rice and onion garnish adds a pleasant tang to the bowl (prepare it while the soup simmers). Starch in the beans will thicken the soup when it's refrigerated overnight, but just add water to reheat the pot. There's plenty of flavor to go around. Serves 6 SOUP 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 large onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 large green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and coarsely chopped 4 teaspoons ground cumin 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1Â½ teaspoons salt 1 pound dried black beans, rinsed 10 cups water, or more if needed 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar 1. In a soup pot over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the onion, garlic, bell pepper, cumin, oregano, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. 2. Add the beans, water, and the vinegar to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a slow simmer. Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the beans are completely tender and creamy. Taste the soup for seasoning and add more salt, if you like. 3. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with spoonfuls of vinegared rice. RICE Â½ cup medium-grain white rice Â¾ cup water Pinch of salt 2 teaspoons olive oil Â½ medium onion, finely chopped 4 teaspoons white vinegar 1. In a small saucepan, combine the rice, water, and salt. Set it over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Stir with a fork, reduce the heat to low, and cover with a lid. Cook for 10 minutes, or until the rice absorbs the water and is tender. Remove the pan from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 10 minutes. 2. Add the oil and fluff with a fork. Let cool to room temperature. 3. In a bowl, combine the onion and vinegar; let them sit while the rice cools. Stir the onions into the cooled rice and transfer to a serving bowl.Sally Pasley Vargas Credit: By Sally Pasley Vargas GLOBE CORRESPONDENT"
142,0,McDonaldâs in Russia: departure is about a lot more than burgers,1278 words,The Guardian,"The shuttering of 850 McDonaldâs franchises around the country is supposed to be temporary, but nothing about the war in Ukraine and the consequent exodus of western companies suggests the rift will be healed any time soon.  McDonaldâs ï¿½?departure, like its arrival, is about a lot more than burgers. The golden arches of history, that once seemed to be bounding forward, now appear to be turning full circle and threatening to take Russia back in time. An urban consumer culture built around Visa and Mastercard , Ikea , Nike , Apple , Zara and Netflix has evaporated in a few days. âThereâs just this sickening feeling that theyâre going to go back, not to the 1990s, but to the 1970s when you didnât have access to these things, and when you were living isolated from the rest of the world,ï¿½?said Prof Angela Stent, a former national intelligence officer for Russia on the National Intelligence Council, now at Georgetown University . The looped trajectory of the past three decades has been driven by a lot of disparate forces, inside and outside Russia, economic and political, and ultimately very personal: the ambitions, fears and impulses of Vladimir Putin . When the first McDonaldâs opened in Russia, the Soviet Union still existed. âWe didnât know what fast food was,ï¿½?wrote Mitya Kushelevich, a photographer, in a recollection in the Guardian [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/04/love-letter-russian-mcdonalds]. âWe thought it probably tasted like freedom and we wanted to sample it.ï¿½?To many people, it tasted like the end of the cold war, if not the end of history. But while Russians wanted to consume capitalism, they were careful from the start not to be consumed by it. âPeople misunderstood: Russians didnât want to be Americans, and they didnât want to be like America, but they wanted the same stuff: the jeans, the cigarettes, the chewing gum, the burgers,ï¿½?said Fiona Hill , who was an exchange student in Russia in the late 1980s and went on to become an intelligence analyst on Russia and then senior director for Europe and Russia in the White House. Nautilus Pompilius, a Russian rock group, had a hit song at the time called Goodbye America, with lyrics that reflected that scepticism, about being âtaught for so long to love your forbidden fruitsï¿½?but finding that âyour ripped jeans have become too small for meï¿½? The honeymoon with westernisation was short-lived. The shock transition from communism to a market economy, shepherded by a liberal government with western consultants, was a disaster, producing oligarchs [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/uk-freezes-assets-of-russian-oligarchs-including-roman-abramovich], lawlessness and poverty. When Putin was first elected president in 2000, Russians looked to him to restore order. But even then, the former KGB officer still had aspirations of turning Russia into a strong market economy, albeit with authoritarian governance. âPutin was saying: âIâll bring you bread and circuses, Iâll bring you Big Macs, Ikea , reality TV like everybody else has, and you leave the politics and the national security to me and everything will be great,âï¿½?said Hill, who has co-authored a biography of the Russian president. In a 2001 speech to the German Bundestag, Putin talked about the two nations âbuilding a common European homeï¿½? âAs for European integration,ï¿½?he said, âwe not just support these processes, but we are looking to them with hope.ï¿½?At the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, Russia vied to be one of the worldâs industrial powers. At the same time, Putinâs government provided the US with logistical help in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks. The disillusion that set in over the ensuing years came from several different directions at once. Putinâs attempt to order a modern economy into being one less reliant on oil and gas faltered in large part because he was not prepared to give up tight central control. Small businesses were given no protection against the oligarchs. And the global financial crash of 2007-08 raised questions over whether the west had a model worth following at all. âWhen the financial crisis hits, the Russians are thinking: these guys arenât that smart,ï¿½?Hill said. âTheyâve just completely and utterly upended not just their own economy, but the global economy.ï¿½?At the same time, Putin and his circle had come to see Nato as an offensive alliance and a threat. When its planes bombed Russiaâs ally Yugoslavia in 1999 [https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/apr/30/balkans11], it was not a defensive act, in Moscowâs eyes, as no Nato member had been attacked. In 2002, George W Bush withdrew the US from the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty with Russia, deepening suspicions about US motives. And the Kremlin was convinced western hands orchestrated the Rose revolution in Georgia in 2003 and the Orange revolution in Ukraine the following year, further undermining Moscowâs sway in what was once the Soviet Union. The belief that those uprisings were western plots was reinforced by the Nato decision during the allianceâs 2008 summit in Bucharest to open the door to membership to both Ukraine and Georgia. âPutin thought that in return for cooperating with the US in Afghanistan, the US would recognise that Russia was a great power with a right to a sphere of influence in the post-Soviet space. Instead he got withdrawal from the ABM treaty, he got the colour revolutions and the Iraq war,ï¿½?Stent said. âI think by 2007, he was thoroughly soured by his experiences with the west, and thatâs also when he started harbouring these territorial designs.ï¿½?The Nato-led intervention in Libya in 2011 [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/17/un-security-council-resolution] led to another sharp downward turn in Russiaâs descent towards isolation. Moscow felt tricked into voting for a UN resolution that approved âall necessary measuresï¿½?to protect Libyan civilians, a move broadly interpreted by the US and its European allies as a mandate for regime change. Putin is said to have repeatedly watched video footage of the murder of Muammar Gaddafi by a vengeful mob. Putinâs way of clawing back Russian relevance from a position of weakness has been to tear up global norms, killing defectors in Britain with radioactive substances [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/nov/25/russia.topstories3] and nerve agents, and in 2014, swiftly annexing Crimea [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/18/putin-confirms-annexation-crimea-ukrainian-soldier-casualty]. The ensuing sanctions served to turn Putinâs Russia even further inward. âAccording to people with knowledge of Mr Putinâs conversations with his aides over the past two years, the president has completely lost interest in the present,ï¿½?Mikhail Zygar, a Russian journalist and author of All the Kremlinâs Men: Inside the Court of Vladimir Putin [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/03/all-kremlins-men-mikhail-zygar-review-inside-court-vladimir-putin], wrote in the New York Times [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/10/opinion/putin-russia-ukraine.html]. âThe economy, social issues, the coronavirus pandemic, these all annoy him ï¿½?In his mind, Mr Putin finds himself in a unique historical situation in which he can finally recover from the previous years of humiliation.ï¿½?The failure to conquer Ukraine with the ease he had expected has added yet more humiliation, to which Putin shows every sign of responding with greater violence, with no end to the murderous cycle in sight. The departure of McDonaldâs and all that represents looks destined to be just a speck in the avalanche brought on by Russiaâs fall."

The IOC and host nation Japan are still confident that the Games will go ahead as planned, but no one has any real idea on how long this might go on for. Just from athletes I have spoken to, there is definitely real concern over the Games. The concern isnât just over whether the games get cancelled or not. For each individual athlete, it is also over their own preparations. As an athlete, getting sick is never great and if you got this virus bad you might face missing weeks of training. It could result on you missing the podium in Tokyo.? Or missing the Games altogether. Another friend of mine told me of his concerns that if they move the Games then he might not even get selected.? With markets crashing and supermarket shelves being cleared, these are definitely interesting times for everybody. But when you are living during this Covid-19 pandemic with a spinal-cord injury I guess it becomes even more daunting ï¿½?as such an injury can remove your cough and sneeze reflex. With very little core function, the thought of not being able to cough is a pretty scary proposition.? This might not sound too bad. But this virus hits elderly people hard ï¿½?and this also includes your biological age due to underlying medical conditions. So this is a scary time, and I completely feel for everyone in the same boat as me how scary this is.?I remember back to catching the flu in November last year ï¿½?I thought I was going to stop breathing. I couldnât cough to clear my lungs as the level of my injury is right at the nerves which go to the lungs.? It knocked me out for weeks, so I would be lying if I said I wasnât slightly scared of Covid-19 and its possible effects on my lungs.? I am a very optimistic person who always looks for solutions over problems. But I must admit this has got me a little bit shaken.? Watching whatâs happening in Italy has been hard to believe ï¿½?particularly as life seemed to be continuing almost as normal here.? I looked at the MRI of a 44-year-old manâs lungs and it was unbelievable, unfortunately he didnât survive.? So I am staying positive but also taking advice from Austrian neurologist Viktor Frankl.?He speaks of acceptance of your current situation. These are his own words ï¿½?which I have had on my wall for the last four years: âThe meaning of life lies in finding a purpose and taking responsibility for ourselves and other human beings.ï¿½?

I am now on day four and thinking this could be a long road ahead; thankfully the weather is getting warmer and I got out on my bike for a few laps of Richmond Park. Along with indoor turbo sessions I am well prepared mentally for the process. I guess all my time in hospital equipped my mind to deal with self-isolating. It also probably helps being an introvert.? I canât help but think of the poor people undergoing their cancer treatment right now though, as I prepare for my own hospital appointment in a few weeks, but I am grateful that side of things is under control.

537,0,Press Release: Pennsylvania Sportsbooks Keep Handle Near Highs with $750 Million in December,834 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"PR Newswire LAS VEGAS, Jan. 20, 2022 LAS VEGAS, Jan. 20, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Betting volume at Pennsylvania's online and retail sportsbooks remained near all-time highs in December with more than $750 million in wagers as revenue slipped from November's record. With a record-shattering $127.6 million in online casino revenue in December, too, the month closed a year that brought more than $6.5 billion in sports wagers, a U.S.-best $122.5 million in tax revenue from sports betting, and nearly $1.3 billion in online casino revenue, according to PlayPennsylvania, which tracks regulated online gaming and sports betting in the state. ""With so many records set this fall, a modest pullback in December is not a particular surprise,"" said Katie Kohler, an analyst for PlayPennsylvania.com. ""Importantly, though, sportsbooks remained near all-time highs for wagering, extending a four-month stretch in which wagering reached nearly $3 million. It's been a fitting end to an impressive year."" In December, Pennsylvania's sportsbooks accepted $750.4 million in wagers, which was up 36.8% from $548.6 million in December 2020, according to official data released Wednesday. December's betting volume was the third-most ever. A month after gross revenue spiked to $84.9 million, bettors won at a far higher rate in December. That created $38.0 million in gross revenue for sportsbooks, down 16.3% from $45.3 million in December's 2020. After $19.1 million in promotional spending, sportsbooks closed the month with $18.8 million in taxable revenue, yielding $6.8 million in state taxes and local share assessments. Wagering nearly doubled in 2021, and no state wrung more tax revenue out of its sports betting industry than Pennsylvania. At the same time, the Keystone State has been surpassed in overall handle by Illinois, which is almost identical in population. For the year, Pennsylvania's retail and online sportsbooks produced: -- $6.5 billion in wagers, up 83.0% from $3.6 billion in 2020. -- $505.5 million in gross revenue, up 87.3% from $269.9 million in 2020. -- $122.5 million in state taxes and local share assessments, up 79.4% from $68.3 million in 2020 ""If the carrot for legislators to legalize sports betting is to create a sustainable and consistent revenue source for the state, no state has been more successful than Pennsylvania,"" said Dustin Gouker, analyst for the PlayUSA.com Network, which includes PlayPennsylvania.com. ""Pennsylvania's relatively high tax rate does seem to contribute to slower growth overall, but that seems to be a worthwhile tradeoff that has been an overall benefit to the state."" In December, online sportsbooks took in $693.3 million in wagers, or 92.4% of the state's handle. FanDuel topped the online market with $246.8 million in wagers, or 32.9% of the state's online market. ""With college football winding down in December, betting on NBA and college basketball made up the difference,"" Kohler said. ""Basketball betting quietly has become an important cog for sportsbooks, especially in the Northeast where basketball takes in more in wagering than football, even as football gains the most attention."" Online casinos and poker Online casinos and poker rooms produced a record $127.6 million in gross gaming revenue in December, topping the previous best of $117.0 million reached in October. Revenue was up 17.6% from $108.5 million in December 2020. Online casino games and poker produced $102.1 million in taxable revenue, which yielded $42.5 million in state taxes and local assessments. Wagering at online casinos rose to $4.3 billion from $3.8 billion in November. For the year, Pennsylvania's online casinos generated: -- $1.3 million in gross revenue from online casino games and poker rooms, up 91.1% from $680.2 million in 2020. -- $466.4 million in state taxes. ""The growth in online casino gambling seems almost endless,"" Kohler said. ""Online casino revenue nearly doubled year over year, a significant jump from 2020 when the global pandemic kept people at home.

818,1,Hays sees workers command pay rises of up to 25% in booming jobs market,602 words,Independent Online,"Paul Venables, the groupâs finance director, told the PA news agency that employees switching jobs for promotion are getting pay rises of close to 20%, with those in highly sought after technology roles able to boost their wages by a quarter. He said there is a shortage of skills worldwide as firms embark on a hiring spree across economies emerging from the pandemic. It's the highest permanent recruitment market in my 16 years with Hays and the highest wage inflation I've seen  Paul Venables, Hays group finance director Technology specialists are among the most in demand due to a push for digital transformations across corporates worldwide, according to Hays. Mr Venables said it was âabsolutely the strongestï¿½?market he has seen during his time at the group and likely for decades. âItâs the highest permanent recruitment market in my 16 years with Hays and the highest wage inflation Iâve seen,ï¿½?he said.  Hays hailed a record performance at the start of 2022 due to the hot jobs market, but revealed a hit of around Â£5 million after pulling out of Russia. The group posted a 32% surge in like-for-like fees over its third quarter to the end of March, with record-breaking results across 19 countries and its highest ever monthly fees in March. Fees in the UK and Ireland [https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ireland] rose 29%, it added. Hays said the closure early last month of its offices in Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine [https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ukraine] will result in about Â£5 million in one-off costs.

63,1,Federal Grant: FY 2022 COPS Hiring Program,1183 words,US Fed News,"Original Closing Date for Applications: June 9 Opportunity Category: Discretionary Funding Instrument Type: Grant Expected Number of Awards: 185 Category of Funding Activity: Law, Justice and Legal Services Eligible Applicants: State governments County governments City or township governments Native American tribal governments (Federally recognized) Others Funding Opportunity Description: The Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) is the component of the U.S. Department of Justice responsible for advancing the practice of community policing by the nations state, local, territorial, and tribal law enforcement agencies through information and grant resources. The COPS Office has invested more than $14 billion to advance community policing, including grants awarded to more than 13,000 state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies to fund the hiring and redeployment of more than 134,000 officers. COPS Office information resources, covering a wide range of community policing topics such as school and campus safety, violent crime, and officer safety and wellness, can be downloaded via the COPS Offices home page, www.cops.usdoj.gov[http://www.cops.usdoj.gov.proxy.library.nyu.edu]. Community policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support the systematic use of partnerships and problem solving techniques to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to public safety issues such as nonviolent crime, violent crime, and fear of crime. The goal of the COPS Hiring Program (CHP) is to provide funding directly to law enforcement agencies to hire and/or rehire additional career law enforcement officers in an effort to increase their community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts. Anticipated outcomes of CHP awards include engagement in planned community partnerships, implementation of projects to analyze and assess problems, implementation of changes to personnel and agency management in support of community policing, and increased capacity of agency to engage in community policing activities. Applicants will be expected to describe their community policing strategy and request the number of newly hired and/or rehired full-time sworn career law enforcement officer positions necessary to support that strategy. COPS Office funding must be used to reorient the mission and activities of law enforcement agencies toward the community or enhance their involvement in community policing. FY 2022 CHP awards will cover up to 75 percent of the entry-level salary and fringe benefits for each approved position for a three-year funding period, based on the applicants current entry level salary levels for full-time officers. There is a minimum 25 percent local cash match (cost share) requirement, unless a waiver is approved. The maximum federal share per officer position is $125,000 over the three-year period, (not $125,00 per year) unless a local match waiver is approved. Any additional costs for higher than entry-level salaries and fringe benefits will be the responsibility of the recipient agency. Funding under this program will support three years of officer or deputy salaries within a five-year period of performance to accommodate time needed for recruitment and hiring. Agencies must retain each CHP-funded position for a minimum of 12 months following the three years of funding for that position. The additional officer positions should be added to your agencys law enforcement budget with state and/or local funds over and above the number of locally funded officer positions that would have existed in the absence of the award. Absorbing CHP-funded positions through attrition (rather than adding the extra positions to your budget with additional funding) does not meet the retention requirement. The COPS Office will fund as many positions as possible for successful applicants; however, the number of officer positions requested by an agency may be reduced based on the availability of funding and other programmatic considerations. Funding under this program may be used for the following: Hire new officers, which includes filling existing officer vacancies that are no longer funded in your agencys budget. These positions must be in addition to your current budgeted (funded) level of sworn officer positions, and the officers must be hired on or after the official award start date on the notice of award. Rehire officers laid off by any jurisdiction as a result of state, local, or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) budget reductions. The rehired officers must be rehired on or after the official award start date on the notice of award. Documentation must be maintained showing the date(s) that the positions were laid off and rehired. Rehire officers who are (at the time of application) currently scheduled to be laid off by your jurisdiction on a specific future date as a result of state, local, or BIA budget reductions. Recipients will be required to continue funding the positions with local funding until the date(s) of the scheduled layoffs. The dates of the scheduled layoffs and the number of positions affected must be identified in the CHP application. The recipient may rehire the officers with CHP funding on or immediately after the date of the scheduled layoff. Unless required by a recipient jurisdiction, the agency is not required to formally complete the administrative steps associated with the layoff of the individual officers it is seeking to rehire so long as the agency can document that a final, approved budget decision was made to lay off those individual officers on the identified layoff date. Documentation must be maintained detailing the dates and reason(s) for the layoffs. Furthermore, agencies awarded will be required to maintain documentation that demonstrates that the scheduled layoffs are occurring for local economic reasons unrelated to the availability of CHP award funds; such documentation may include local council meeting minutes, memoranda, notices, or orders discussing the layoffs, budget documents ordering jurisdiction-wide budget reductions, and/or notices provided to the individual officers regarding the layoffs. An applicant may request funding in one or more of the above-referenced hiring categories under CHP. If an application is approved for funding, the notice of award will specify the number of positions approved in each category. Once awarded, recipient agencies may not move funded positions between the hiring categories without receiving written prior approval from the COPS Office. An applicant may not reduce its existing current fiscal year budget for sworn officers just to make use of the CHP award. Any budget cut must be unrelated to the receipt of CHP award funds to avoid a violation of the COPS Office statutory non- supplanting requirement. The COPS Office is committed to advancing work that promotes civil rights and racial equity, increases access to justice, supports crime victims and individuals impacted by the justice system, strengthens community safety and protects the public from crime and evolving threats, and builds trust between law enforcement and the community.

But Prime Minister Fumio Kishida asked for understanding regarding the decision. ""I am making the request as I believe that through proceeding with various measures, we will achieve certain results,"" he said during a House of Representatives Budget Committee meeting. Hitoshi Kikawada, senior vice minister at the Cabinet Office, told the panel that the 17 prefectures seeking extensions ""face the possibility of an increase in the number of patients with severe symptoms and need to reduce the burden on their health care systems."" Kikawada said the strain on hospitals had eased in the five other prefectures -- Yamagata, Shimane, Yamaguchi, Oita and Okinawa. The quasi-emergency measures were set to expire Sunday in 16 of the 17 prefectures and on Feb. 27 in Wakayama in western Japan. The remaining 13 prefectures are Hokkaido, Aomori, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Ishikawa, Nagano, Shizuoka, Hyogo, Okayama, Hiroshima, Saga and Kagoshima. But Japan on Friday confirmed 211 virus-related deaths, the fourth consecutive day that the count has gone over 200. The seven-day rolling average for deaths was also at a record 190. Daily new infections remained high nationwide at 87,723, including 16,129 cases in Tokyo and 11,505 in Osaka Prefecture. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said at a news conference that experts believe the recent wave of infections has likely peaked, and the government plans to ""confirm the downtrends in the infection situation and the strain on hospitals"" in the extended two weeks. The government could lift the measures before the scheduled end date if the situation improves and local governors call for it. The quasi-emergency measures have been in place since January in many of the areas to prevent a surge in COVID-19 patients from overwhelming hospitals. The government will also begin implementing a new policy for allowing children between five and 11 years old to be vaccinated for the first time from late February. As inoculation is not compulsory, authorities will focus on promoting the safety and efficacy of vaccines for children. The highly transmissible Omicron strain tends to cause no or mild symptoms. But elderly people and those with underlying health conditions are more likely to develop severe symptoms requiring medical treatment. ==Kyodo"

This was up from 265,613 the month before and from 256,145 in March 2021. At the start of the pandemic, 263,292 people were in payrolled jobs in the area. Different figures show that across the UK, the unemployment rate hit 3.8 per cent in the three months to February ï¿½?it has not been lower than this since 1974. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""The stats show the continued strength of our jobs market, with the number of employees on payrolls rising once again in March and unemployment falling further below pre-pandemic levels."" Separate ONS figures also show there has been a fall in the number of people claiming unemployment benefits in the Wyre Forest local authority area over the last year. Around 2,230 people were on out-of-work benefits as of March 10, down by 1,250 from 3,480 at the same point the year before. It meant 3.8 per cent of the area's working population sought support in March."
878,0,'Anti-India' content: Govt cracks down on 35 YouTube channels,641 words,Hindustan Times,"Union minister of information and technology Anurag Thakur said after the Cabinet meeting that any social media account trying to mislead the public would also be taken down. ""Any account that is trying to spin a conspiracy or mislead the people will be actioned,"" he told reporters. The channels, according to the ministry, have over 12,123,500 subscribers and over 1,320,426,964 views. They include Khabar with facts, Khabar Taiz, Information Hub, Flash Now, Mera Pakistan With, Hakikat Ki Duniya and Apni Dunya Tv. ""These channels were spreading misinformation about the Indian army, including conspiracies that the death of chief of defence staff Bipin Rawat was an assassination,"" said joint secretary in the I&B ministry and the designated officer for take downs, Vikram Sahay. ""These threaten the sovereignty and the integrity of India."" According to the ministry, the YouTube channels, websites, and other social media accounts blocked were used by ""Pakistan for spreading anti-India fake news about sensitive subjects related to India"". ""These include topics such as the Indian Army, Jammu and Kashmir, and India's foreign relations with other countries. It was observed that rampant fake news was spread through the YouTube channels regarding the demise of the former Chief of Defence Staff Late General Bipin Rawat. These YouTube channels had also started posting content to undermine the democratic process of the upcoming elections in five states,"" the ministry said in a press release. ""The channels propagated content to encourage separatism, divide India on the lines of religion, and create animosity among the various sections of the Indian society. Such information was feared to have the potential to incite the audience into commission of crimes adversely affecting public order in the country."" The last round of blocks in December 2021 was actioned on a global level, with YouTube taking down the channels across the world and not just in India. The blocking directions have been issued using the emergency powers granted to the secretary of the I&B ministry, who on being notified by the authorised officer, can order an immediate takedown of content under the new social media and intermediary guidelines. The interim order will be placed in front of the inter-departmental committee for review. The interdepartmental committee forms the apex of the three-tier redressal mechanism, which includes a self-regulatory mechanism, followed by regulation by industry bodies. The committee, in a first, also has members from the industry body - one member each from the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry and Confederation of Indian Industry, one member from the Bar Council of India and a member from the Press Council of India. Besides these, the committee also has members from the ministry of women and child development, ministry of law and justice, ministry of home affairs, ministry of electronics and information technology, ministry of external affairs and ministry of defence. The guidelines have been challenged by various media consortiums in court for leading to censorship of news content. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times."

535,0,Doug Ford unveils schedule to ease COVID-19 restrictions starting Jan. 31,1025 words,The Toronto Star,"But there have been signs that COVID-19 infection rates are easing as the fast-moving Omicron variant appears to be peaking after racing through the province since emerging in late November. âWe can be confident that the worst is behind us as we look to cautiously ease public health measures,ï¿½?the premier told reporters at Queenâs Park. âThe coming weeks will continue to pose real challenges, especially to our hospitals, but those are challenges our hospital system can manage.ï¿½?Ontarioâs pandemic plan ï¿½?which is subject to improving trends and could be paused if necessary ï¿½?lifts additional prohibitions on Feb. 21 and March 14 âto make sure we havenât moved too fast,ï¿½?Ford added. There was no date set for resuming thousands of non-emergency surgeries, including cancer and heart procedures, halted by government directive weeks ago to free up beds for COVID patients, many of whom are unvaccinated. Health Minister Christine Elliott warned a resumption of those surgeries may take until mid-February when intensive care unit admissions are expected to decline. âItâs got to be terrifying for folks who are waiting,ï¿½?said New Democrat Leader Andrea Horwath, critical of the delay of as many as 10,000 surgeries a week while restaurants and gyms are cleared to reopen.  Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, meanwhile, called Fordâs road map a âmega slow reopening planï¿½?and said thousands of small businesses will continue to lose money while capacity restrictions remain in place. âLockdowns and closures are destructive for businesses and while we welcome this opening ï¿½?even at 50 per cent capacity, the industry is facing a tough road,ï¿½?added the Ontario Restaurant Hotel & Motel Association. Ford said there is no plan âat this pointï¿½?to make booster doses a requirement for being fully vaccinated under the terms of the provinceâs proof-of-vaccination systems. Two doses is considered fully vaccinated and is the requirement for getting into restaurants, bars, gyms, theatres, sports arenas and other venues. But Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca said a third dose requirement should be in place for Jan. 31, as it would encourage more people to get boosters. âWe canât falter now,ï¿½?said Del Duca. Epidemiologist Todd Coleman of Wilfrid Laurier University said increasing booster levels is important, the rate of deaths has been rising and the reopening is too soon given that in-class learning has just resumed this week. âI would wait a bit longer to see what ends up happening as a result of schools reopening before making any ultimate decisions.ï¿½?Also on Jan. 31, gathering limits will increase to 10 people indoors and 25 outdoors. Stadiums like the Scotiabank Arena for Leafs and Raptors games and concert venues will be limited to 50 per cent seated capacity or 500 people, whichever is less. The initial stage of reopening will be in place until Feb. 21. Thatâs to give health officials time to gauge the impact on infection levels and hospitalizations and to continue the push for vaccinations. So far, 88 per cent of eligible Ontarians aged five and up have had one shot and 82 per cent are fully vaccinated. On Feb. 21, gathering limits will increase to 25 people indoors and 100 outdoors, capacity limits in venues with proof of vaccination requirements ï¿½?such as restaurants and bars ï¿½?will be lifted. As well, sporting and concert venues will increase to 50 per cent capacity. Three weeks after that ï¿½?on March 14 ï¿½?the plan is to remove all remaining capacity limits in indoor settings, though proof-of-vaccination rules through the Verify Ontario QR code system will continue. At that time, there will be an increase of social gathering limits to 50 people indoors with no limits for those outdoors. While hospital admissions have hit levels never before seen in the 22-month pandemic, the less serious nature of Omicron compared with earlier strains of COVID-19 has reduced hospital stays to an average of five days from nine, said Ontarioâs chief medical officer Dr. Kieran Moore. Moore noted unvaccinated Ontarians account for 50 per cent of the patients in intensive care units, even though they represent only around 10 per cent of the population. Businesses, closed Jan. 5 in the face of what Ford warned was an Omicron âtsunami,ï¿½?had been tentatively slated to reopen next Wednesday. But the situation in hospitals, where staff shortages from illness and isolation have been rampant, and the return to classrooms prompted the extra five days of restrictions. Hospital occupancy for COVID-19 fell in Thursdayâs report for the second day in a row, dropping by 71 patients to 4,061. Intensive care unit occupancy was up by five patients to 594, but is well within overall capacity of about 2,400 beds and below the levels that pushed the ICU system to a breaking point last spring. There are 1,284 patients in ICUs who do not have COVID-19 and 476 beds empty. There were 7,757 new cases of the coronavirus detected in PCR tests that have now been limited mainly to hospital and related health-care workers and high-risk individuals. Officials caution that number is an underestimate of the full extent of COVID-19 in the province, given the testing restrictions and limited numbers of rapid antigen tests available.

114,0,The Court of Master Sommeliers aims to restore its reputation after scandals,914 words,The Washington Post,"It was a spectacular implosion for an organization that skyrocketed to fame over the previous decade on the coattails of a booming restaurant trade and consumer fascination with wine. The ""Somm"" series of movies portrayed the dedication and professionalism required to pursue the coveted red lapel pin of the master sommelier, the profession's highest rank. The films also showed the sacrifices and, to some extent, the recklessness inherent in a professional pursuit centered on the consumption of alcohol. A cheating scandal in 2018 tarnished the court's image, and the triple blows of 2020 brought it to the precipice of irrelevance. A lot of money was at stake. Master somms are rare. There are only 172 in the Court of Master Sommeliers, Americas, out of 269 worldwide. Once they attain their lapel pins, few continue to work the restaurant floor. They typically move on to corporate positions, managing a restaurant group's beverage program, working with importers or distributors, even wineries. That's not to say they leave the profession - they often do wine education and training for restaurant staff, and they teach the court's certification courses and proctor its exams. (Which loops back to the sexual harassment scandal.) If the court were to lose its stature and prestige, the pin would lose its Midas touch. So in late 2020, the Americas chapter board of directors resigned en masse and members elected a new board, led by two women. (Of the 172 master somms in the chapter, 28 are women.) The new board hired a professional ethicist to revamp its code of ethics, contracted with a firm specializing in workplace harassment issues to transform its organizational culture, and hired a third-party investigator to look into the harassment claims. That investigation culminated in November when the court expelled six members, including Fred Dame, who co-founded the Americas chapter and helped build the organization in the United States. ""We faced a lot of criticism, but when the previous board entirely stepped down, that allowed us to say everything was on the table,"" said Emily Wines, the appropriately named chair of the new board of directors. Wines earned her pin in 2008 and is vice president of the beverage program for the Cooper's Hawk Winery restaurant chain. To make the organization more professional, the board hired an executive director to handle day-to-day operations. They chose Julie Cohen Theobald, who brought more than two decades of experience as a brand manager for Procter & Gamble, as well as work in the nonprofit sector. Theobald had no experience in the wine or service industry, but she liked the challenge of addressing the court's scandals. ""There are few opportunities in life to make an impact on gender and diversity issues,"" Theobald said in a recent interview. ""We may be a small organization, but we have a degree of influence on the industry and maybe even society."" Since Theobald joined the court last autumn, the board added four new members from outside the wine industry. They brought expertise in human resources, credentialing, hospitality and diversity. The goal is to move to a ""classic nonprofit structure"" that will have lasting change to ripple through the wine service sector, she said. Diversity is key to that change. ""It's a male-dominated industry, so we want to make sure it's a safe space and give women a way to report problems instead of just silently walking away,"" Wines said. To that end, the court established an independent hotline for harassment complaints. It also took steps to improve racial diversity. ""We can't just say our programs are open; we have to look at who's coming to the door in the first place,"" Wines said. ""So we created 100 scholarships for people of color, women and people in need to take our introductory program."" Because of the coronavirus pandemic, that program is now online, which eliminates travel costs for candidates to take the exams in big cities. The new board is also moving away from the celebrity somm to emphasize professionalism. ""It's a service industry and a trade, so we don't want to elevate sommeliers as superstars, but elevate the profession,"" Wines said. ""Especially after covid, the profession has changed a lot, and we need to change with it. When restaurants hit hard times, sommeliers are often the first to be cut. We want to emphasize not just wine knowledge, but how to run a beverage program and a restaurant."" We may not see lapel pins for master ""sommager,"" the slang term for a combination sommelier and manager. But by becoming more versatile, the sommelier may become more essential.

427,1,Talent churn in IT sector may stabilize in six months,469 words,Hindustan Times,"""Talent that transitioned out from Infosys and TCS last financial year was absorbed by a nearly identical set of enterprises. In either of the cases, the Ttop 12 absorbers have taken over one-third of talent on the move,"" said Kamal Karanth, co-founder, Xpheno, a specialist staffing company. According to Xpheno's data, shared exclusively with Mint, most people who left Infosys in FY22 joined Accenture followed by Cognizant, TCS, and Deloitte. At the same time, top recruiters who picked up TCS employees were Accenture, Cognizant, Infosys and Deloitte. On a last-12 months basis, Infosys's attrition rate increased to 27.7% in Q4 from 15.2% a year ago and 25.5% in the October-December quarter. On the same basis, the attrition rate of TCS, lowest in the industry, increased to 17.4% in Q4 from 7.2% a year ago and 15.3% in the October-December quarter. However, this guzzling of talent may not last for more than two quarters. ""We see this trend continuing for six months as all companies will have to be profitable as much as they can and this environment will reset. Ultimately, the skills are not valuable if you keep outpaying someone beyond its value,"" Thirukkumaran Nagarajan, vice president and head of human resources, IBM India and South Asia, told Mint. IBM's attrition is higher than in the past but is lower than markets at sub 20%.  HCL Technologies and Wipro will announce the Q4 results on April 21 and 29. The industry has been battling high attrition rates as demand for digital talent continues to outpace supply. The 'Great Resignation' was the term coined a few months ago when employees, mainly in the tech and startup sector, were flooded with offers, joining bonuses and counter offers. As India Inc tries to keep pace with digital adoption and cloud-based services, their need for experts in Java, Javascript, Python, SQL, remains unsatiated.

559,0,"Trump plans 2,300 new homes at struggling Doral resort",492 words,Associated Press Newswires,"The Doral, the biggest revenue generator among Trump's 17 golf properties, has been a drain on the business in recent years. In 2019, Trump announced plans to hold the global meeting of Group of Seven leaders at the resort, a potential big money maker for hosts. But he had to cancel after a bipartisan outcry over self-dealing and a possible violation of a constitutional ban on presidents receiving gifts or payments from foreign leaders. The resort had hoped to regain ground after the PGA and other organizations pulled events there, but finances have only gotten worse since. Revenue plunged more than by $33 million over the next two years, down more than 40%, according to financial statements filed with a federal government ethics office. As of last year, the Trump company had $125 million borrowed on the property. The Trump Organization did not reply to requests for comment. The press release had an official U.S. government seal with an American eagle at top, an unusual use given the release was promoting a private business venture. Former presidents can use the seal for matters involving their former office, but are not allowed to profit from it. Under federal law, the seal can only be used for official government business. The Trump Organizationâs plans for Doral are part of a string of recent business moves after months of relative quiet. In September, several news outlets reported that the company had struck a preliminary deal to sell the lease underlying its Washington, D.C., hotel to Miami-based CGI Merchant Group for $375 million, much more than many hotel experts had expected for the money-losing property. In October, Trump announced a new rival to Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms that had banned him after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 last year. The business said it is will give voice to others who've been taken off social media sites as part of âcancel culture."" Last month, it said it had raised $1 billion from unnamed investors and plans to launch the messaging app called Truth Social early this year."

If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member. Investors who purchased Rivian shares pursuant or traceable to Rivian's IPO on November 10, 2021 and who lost money are strongly encouraged to contact Block & Leviton attorneys at (617) 398-5600, via email at cases@blockleviton.com, or to visit our website for information on the case. The deadline to seek appointment as lead plaintiff is May 6, 2022. What is this all about?  Rivian is an electric vehicle company that in 2018 unveiled its first consumer EV's, the R1T electric pickup truck, and the R1S electric SUV. On November 10, 2021, Rivian offered 153 million shares to the public through an IPO at a price of $78.00 per share for total proceeds of $11.93 billion. According to the Registration Statement, the ""R1T and R1S introduce our brand to the world and will serve as our flagship vehicles as we continue to expand our offerings.""  Rivian's focus on its reputation for transparency and devotion to its customers, along with Rivian's R1T and R1S, including the large number of preorders and potential for increased demand were key selling points to IPO investors. Unbeknownst to investors, however, the Registration Statement's representations were materially inaccurate, misleading, and/or incomplete because they failed to disclose, among other things, that the R1T and R1S were underpriced to such a degree that Rivian would have to raise prices shortly after the IPO and that these price increases would tarnish Rivian's reputation as a trustworthy and transparent company and would put a significant number of the existing backlog of 55,400 preorders along with future preorders in jeopardy of cancellation. As a result, the price of the Company's shares was artificially and materially inflated at the time of the Offering.

647,0,Facebookâs parent company says it shut down digital operations targeting Ukraine.,614 words,NYTimes.com Feed,"The influence network engaged in what Facebook calls âcoordinated inauthentic behavior,ï¿½?or groups of Facebook accounts and pages that operate under false names and fake profile photos to spread targeted messages across the platform. The campaign received fewer than 5,000 followers across Facebook and Instagram before being taken offline, Meta officials said. Meta said the disinformation campaign was active on other social media platforms, including Twitter, YouTube, the European social network VK, the Russian social platform Odnoklassniki and the chat app Telegram. A Twitter spokeswoman said the company had removed more than a dozen accounts that participated in the campaigns and blocked several links from being shared on Twitter. âThe accounts and links originated in Russia and were attempting to disrupt the public conversation around the ongoing conflict in Ukraine,ï¿½?the Twitter spokeswoman said.  YouTube said in a statement on Monday morning that it had shut down five channels with less than 90 subscribers as part of its investigation into a coordinated influence operation linked to Russia. Meta said it had also detected a hacking operation that targeted military leaders and politicians in Ukraine, as well as at least one journalist. The effort, which Meta said was linked to the hacking group Ghostwriter, attempted to take over these high-profile accounts and then use them to spread disinformation. Ghostwriter has targeted politicians in Eastern Europe for several years, often pushing narratives that oppose NATO and the United States. The hacking group was long thought to be affiliated with Russia. But in November, the threat intelligence firm Mandiant[https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government] discovered that the group was linked to Belarus. âGhostwriter has previously targeted the NATO alliance, seeking to erode support for the organization,ï¿½?Ben Read, a director at Mandiant, said in a statement. âI wouldnât be surprised if similar operations were seen in the near future.ï¿½?A small number of high-profile individuals were targeted, and several Facebook accounts were compromised, Meta executives said. Some posts on those accounts attempted to portray the Ukrainian military surrendering, sharing videos of soldiers walking out of a forest waving a white flag. Facebook was able, in some cases, to block the hackers from posting. âHistorically, what weâve seen from Ghostwriter is targeting of military, public figures, journalists and politicians across Europe,ï¿½?said David Agranovich, a director of threat disruption at Meta. âSince the invasion, weâve seen a pivot in Ghostwriterâs focus to people in Ukraine.ï¿½?Meta is among a number of Silicon Valley social media companies under pressure as Russian operatives attempt to spread digital propaganda campaigns across the internet in tandem with President Vladimir V. Putinâs siege of Ukraine. Meta has focused on taking action against entities that violate the companyâs policies regulating behavior on its platforms. Meta, YouTube and Twitter have also blocked Russian state media outlets from monetizing their pages on the platforms."
5,0,Palmer launches lofty pitch for share of nation's disaffected voters,720 words,The Sydney Morning Herald - Online,"""The message for Australians is, if you're happy with everything that's been done now, if you think it's sufficient, if it's enough for you and your family, then vote again for Scott Morrison,"" Palmer told the crowd of about 1100 packed into one of the compound's conference spaces. ""But if you really care about our country ï¿½?you must vote for the United Australia Party."" The UAP is again going big in its attempt to carve out a share of the nation's disaffected voters from the likes of fellow Queenslander Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, both of which are running candidates in almost all lower and upper house contests. After being ferried from the car park in golf carts, supporters and candidates sat in darkness - illuminated by a big-screen replay of Palmer's recent National Press Club speech - while they awaited the duo's arrival. Songs from a cover band, including Tracy Chapman's Talkin' bout a Revolution, and a video reel of policy sound bites laced with calls to ""save Australia"" and ""save your life"" followed. The party chairman, one-term federal MP and billionaire mining magnate - undeterred by a fall during Friday's rehearsals - entered to a raucous welcome before kicking off with the party's major populist policies, several of which have had questions raised over their effectiveness, or even feasibility. Kelly, who is trying to retain his NSW seat of Hughes after switching party allegiances, was then introduced as ""Australia's next prime minister"", in an echo of ubiquitous newspaper ads. He took the podium and touched further on the party's proposed bill of rights, ban on lockdowns, and abolition of national cabinet. ""We must save Australians from what is coming after the election,"" he said. ""They will lock us down again."" Kelly then railed against the ""Labor and Liberal coalition"" to boos and jeers. A few shouts of ""sack them"" and ""jail them"" also rose from the crowd. At a later press conference, Palmer and Kelly brushed off questions about plans to seemingly repeat the party's 2019 advertising spend - dubbed ""dangerous"" by a former Appeal Court judge - and failure to win a single seat with about 3.4 per cent of the national vote. ""I don't think you can compare this election campaign with the last one,"" Kelly said. Palmer suggested it was ""not about how much money you spend ... it's irrelevant. The election is about what you can do for the Australian people"". Palmer is vying with Hanson and former Liberal National Party premier turned-Liberal Democrat Campbell Newman for what is expected to be, at most, two of the six Senate seats in a race that also includes the third-placed LNP candidate, Assistant Minister to the Attorney-General Amanda Stoker. The latest Resolve Political Monitor, conducted for this masthead in early April, found combined support for UAP and One Nation totalled just 5 per cent nationwide. Despite the tens of millions of dollars already poured into his campaign, Palmer's party managed just 2 per cent of the surveyed primary vote intention in Queensland, compared to the 5 per cent share of Hanson's 25-year-old populist right-wing political vehicle. The Greens sat at 14 per cent. Beyond their broad anti-major party sentiment, neither Kelly nor Palmer would be drawn on where they might suggest voters park preferences.

Not both.ï¿½?Joni Mitchell soon followed[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/28/arts/music/joni-mitchell-neil-young-spotify.html], as did others like the Spotify podcaster BrenÃ© Brown, who vowed[https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/30/22909140/brene-brown-spotify-podcast-joe-rogan-controversy] over the weekend not to release new episodes of her shows âUnlocking Usï¿½?and âDare to Lead.ï¿½?Rather than give in to critics, Spotify has held its ground and, in recent days, most of Mr. Youngâs and Ms. Mitchellâs music has been pulled [https://www-latimes-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/entertainment-arts/music/story/2022-01-31/spotify-neil-young-joni-mitchell-joe-rogan-covid-19]from its library. The service said[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/business/dealbook/spotify-rogan-ek.html] suppressing or editing Mr. Roganâs podcast would amount to censorship ï¿½?but anyone whoâs paid attention to online content moderation knows thatâs a charade. Facebook, in particular, has trotted out that excuse time and again when it ought to have blocked or removed content or users. Donât be fooled. Peer just beneath the surface and it becomes clear that for big social media companies, matters of âcensorshipï¿½?are always matters of business. Facebook, for example, has had special exemptions[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353] from its rules for the very people who are most likely to be believed: politicians and celebrities. More such speech, more advertising revenue. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube remove content posted by regular folks every day with no apparent worries about grand matters of free speech. Removing accounts by Donald Trump and, more recently, Marjorie Taylor Greene[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/02/technology/marjorie-taylor-greene-twitter.html] after repeated and flagrant policy violations was done only when it became a business imperative. If, as Spotify implies, Mr. Roganâs views offend its sensibilities, there ought to be nothing to prevent the service from scaling his podcast back. As the exclusive rights holder for the podcast, it has more control over and responsibility for Mr. Roganâs content than do social media companies over users who post Covid misinformation. But Spotify paid dearly for Mr. Roganâs podcast (a reported $100 million[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/business/joe-rogan-spotify.html]) and the will of two rockers past their primes and a few others, does not ï¿½?from a business perspective ï¿½?outweigh Mr. Roganâs 11 million regular listeners[https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-60192957]. Mr. Rogan has expressed contrition[https://www.instagram.com/tv/CZYQ_nDJi6G] and vowed to more carefully vet his guests. Spotify, for its part, said it will post warning labels[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/30/arts/music/spotify-joe-rogan-ceo.html] on his content and that of others directly discussing Covid. But thatâs all window dressing. Twitter and Facebookâs experiments with warning labels and links to authoritative sources proved unable to stop the spread of misinformation during the 2020 election and havenât been effective in culling similarly dangerous ideas in the pandemic. In a Sunday blog post[https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-01-30/spotifys-platform-rules-and-approach-to-covid-19/] that did not include any mention of Mr. Rogan or his podcast, Spotifyâs chief executive, Daniel Ek, appears to take a strong stance against violations of the serviceâs rules. Still, he resisted calls to take more muscular action. âThere are plenty of individuals and views on Spotify that I disagree with strongly,ï¿½?Mr. Ek wrote. âWe have a critical role to play in supporting creator expression while balancing it with the safety of our users. In that role, it is important to me that we donât take on the position of being content censor.ï¿½?Whatever Spotify executivesï¿½?true feelings about Mr. Rogan or the pandemic, Mr. Ek is really playing defense for his cash cow ï¿½?and if he gives in on this issue and heâll have to give in on the next one and the next one after that. Given an opening, thereâs no shortage of customers and artists whoâd be thrilled to pressure the company to remove content from Barack and Michelle Obamaâs production company, which has its own exclusive deal with Spotify[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/22/books/barack-obama-bruce-springsteen-renegades-spotify.html]. Losing Joni Mitchell is a shame, but losing Mr. Rogan or Mr. Obama would be terrible for business, whatever nonsense either may spew. Investors have rewarded[https://deadline.com/2022/01/spotify-joe-rogan-neil-young-netflix-roku-1234923207/] the strategy. Shares of Spotify are up more than 15 percent since Mr. Youngâs music started being taken off the service last week, even amid what was the worst start[https://www.reuters.com/business/nasdaq-futures-edge-higher-end-turbulent-month-2022-01-31/] to the year in over a decade for the broader market. Mr. Ekâs blog post laid out the companyâs rules of the road, but Spotify knew exactly who Mr. Rogan was when it signed its exclusive deal with him nearly two years ago.

63,0,UPDATE 3-Shanghai's Disney resort shut amid record daily local COVID infections,644 words,Reuters News,"* Policy of ""dynamic clearance"" brings school closures, testing (Adds Tangshan curbs, Shenzhen easing; paragraphs 14-18) SHANGHAI, March 21 (Reuters) - China's financial hub of Shanghai reported on Monday a record daily surge in local COVID-19 infections as authorities scrambled to test residents and rein in the Omicron variant, while closing its Disney resort until further notice. Until recent weeks relatively unscathed by coronavirus, Shanghai reported 24 new domestically transmitted COVID cases with confirmed symptoms for Sunday and 734 local asymptomatic infections, official data showed on Monday. It is the fourth consecutive day that Shanghai's local asymptomatic infections have increased. Although the tally of infections is tiny by global standards, Shanghai has quickly followed China's ""dynamic clearance"" policies, shutting schools and testing residential compounds in the effort to limit the spread of the virus. ""When it comes to the entire situation of epidemic control and prevention that we are facing, it is very complex and serious, and it is also a very big test for us,"" city health official Wu Jinglei told a news briefing. Shanghai will stick with ""dynamic clearance"", Wu added, saying he hoped for continued public support for the policy. The city also shut the Shanghai Disney Resort from Monday until further notice. But there were signs of frustration with the city's ad hoc, district-by-district approach. ""Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen have had three different epidemic response models,"" said a user of China's Twitter-like Weibo network. ""Hong Kong is the worst but will be the first to open up,"" the writer, going by the name zangyn, said in a widely shared post. ""Shenzhen is the most effective, and Shanghai may be the most tiring, and even the most miserable."" The severity of outbreak responses by Shanghai's compounds and residential districts varied, with some opting for lockdowns as long as two weeks. Some people in other sealed-off districts said they were not told how long they would have to stay home. Residents' committees helping to organise testing programmes also encountered challenges. One compound distributed tokens to foil outsiders' attempts to take free tests. Including Shanghai infections, mainland China reported a total of 1,947 new locally transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms on Sunday, data from the National Health Commission (NHC) showed, up from 1,656 a day earlier. The top steelmaking city of Tangshan, with just 12 local infections since March. 19, is allowing only essential vehicles on roads smaller than expressways, while people with special needs who must use vehicles have to seek approval. The southern manufacturing hub of Shenzhen has allowed work and production activities, as well as bus and subway services in most areas, to resume after daily local case numbers dropped following three rounds of city-wide testing. Tight curbs remain in some places, however. Shenzhen residents still need to show negative tests in order to use public transport from Monday until March 27, a period in which non-essential indoor services will stay closed, the city government has said. Vaccine candidates to target Omicron specifically, or among variants of concern, are in studies prior to clinical trials, a national health official said on Saturday, without identifying the companies involved. China's new local asymptomatic cases, which it does not classify as confirmed cases, was 2,384, up from 2,177 a day earlier. The death toll was unchanged at 4,638, with no new deaths. By Sunday, mainland China had reported 132,226 cases with confirmed symptoms, both among locals and arrivals from outside.

127,0,A surge of Omicron cases prompts lockdowns in China.,317 words,NYTimes.com Feed,"Even as countries in the West are now loosening or abandoning mask mandates and other measures, Chinese officials are implementing some of their most stringent methods. That is in large part because China canât afford to lift restrictions. The government has been concerned about comparatively lower rates of vaccination among Chinaâs older adults. The country also has far fewer intensive care hospital beds compared to its population than most industrialized countries. In Chinaâs vast rural areas, hospitals and medical facilities are often basic, and a major outbreak could quickly overwhelm hospitals. The United States and other Western countries have suffered far higher rates of infection and deaths over the past two years than China, and still have higher rates now. But the seven-day average rate of new cases in mainland China, now at 1,584, has more than quintupled in recent days. For many residents in China, the rapid spread of the virus has been unsettling. âBecause of the large number of cases in a short period of time, it is inevitable that there will be some panic all over the country, and Shanghai is no exception,ï¿½?said Dr. Zhang Wenhong, a prominent infectious disease expert in Shanghai, in a post on his social media account on Monday."
283,1,Lockheed reveals its toughest tech jobs to fill in Orlando ï¿½?and what it looks for in employees,409 words,Jacksonville Business Journal,"In fact, Cadle said thereâs been a shift in the talent demands at the company, which employs 8,000 people between two Orlando campuses. Lockheedâs industry traditionally placed emphasis on individuals with specialized skill sets. However, the company today is in search of well-rounded talent with solid communication and critical thinking skills, as well as an understanding of subjects outside their roles, Cadle said. âWeâre looking for a hardware engineer whoâs able to understand integrating the software piece of it.ï¿½?Further, Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed needs plenty of local workers. In fact, the companyâs website lists 579 open positions in metro Orlando [https://www.lockheedmartinjobs.com/search-jobs/Orlando%2C%20FL/694/4/6252001-4155751-4167060-4167147/28x53834/-81x37924/25/2], and more than 400 of those are engineering roles. While Lockheed faces the same struggles many tech-focused employers do when trying to hire from a competitive and limited pool of engineers, the company has found success building a talent pipeline with the University of Central Florida. Through the UCF Lockheed Martin Work Experience Program, Lockheed hosts 650 UCF students each year, providing them with paid work experience. The longstanding program has built up a reputation among UCFâs engineering students, who tend to view Lockheed as the âemployer of choice,ï¿½?UCF Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Michael Johnson said during the roundtable. âItâs like a branded internship program. Lockheed signs are all over the engineering building.ï¿½?Meanwhile, the program provides results for Lockheed. Roughly 75% of the students going through the program are eventually become Lockheed employees, Cadle added. A robust talent pipeline can help Lockheed fill high-wage jobs in Central Florida. Engineering jobs in metro Orlando pay average annual wages ranging from $84,930-$115,630, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Thatâs much more than metro Orlandoâs average annual wage of $50,770. Did you find this article useful?

So far, Joni Mitchell along with Young's former bandmates David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash have followed Young's suit and left Spotify.

58,1,"As Covid numbers subside, the common cold makes its return",331 words,Irish Daily Mail,"As of yesterday morning, there were 809 people in hospital with Covid, of which 53 were in ICU. This is down from 904 recorded on Thursday. Figures compiled by the Irish-owned network of community pharmacies CarePlus Pharmacy showed an increase of 83% in sales of common over-thecounter remedies in March compared to the same month last year. Speaking yesterday, pharmacist Nigel Moloney, of CarePlus Pharmacy in Carrigaline in Cork said: 'We have had lots of people with symptoms such as sore throats, headaches and chills, but who tested negative for Covid using PCR and antigens. But they still felt unwell and have been seeking over-the-counter products to relieve their symptoms. 'As a basic measure, we recommend people get a good balance of basic nutrients, particularly those which may help support their immune systems, such as vitamin D, vitamin C and zinc.' According to the HPSC, Waterford's Covid incidence is currently 661.9 per 100,000 people, followed by Carlow at 586.7 cases per 100,000 people. The counties with the lowest rates of infection are Monaghan, Donegal, Mayo, Cavan, Leitrim, Meath, Roscommon, Louth and Dublin. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation's Dr Michael Ryan said it is wrong to think that Covid will be endemic - similar to the flu - and that would be the end of the problem. 'I certainly do not believe we've reached anything close to an endemic situation with this virus. That is not an endemic disease yet,' he said, citing tuberculosis and malaria which are endemic and yet have killed millions.'"

The increase in U.S. natural gas consumption is a result of colder forecast temperatures in 2022 compared with 2021, which results in more consumption in the residential and commercial sectors. In addition, we expect the industrial sector to consume more natural gas in 2022 in response to expanding economic activity. ""We expect U.S. natural gas consumption will average 84.7 Bcf/d in 2023. We estimate dry natural gas production averaged 96.2 Bcf/d in the United States in March, up 1.2 Bcf/d from February. Similar to January and February, production in March was lower than in December because of brief periods of freezing temperatures in certain production regions and, in part, because of maintenance, according to public sources. We forecast dry natural gas production to average 96.9 Bcf/d in April. For all of 2022, we expect that dry natural gas production will average 97.4 Bcf/d, which would be 3.8 Bcf/d more than in 2021. We expect dry natural gas production to average of 100.9 Bcf/d in 2023,"" says the report."

276,1,Auto insurance brought in $1.3 billion more than they paid out in 2020: Superintendent report,914 words,Postmedia Breaking News,"NDP energy critic Kathleen Ganley said Friday that insurance companies are making hundreds of millions more off the backs of Alberta drivers with the help of UCP policies. Premier Jason Kenney scrapped a rate increase cap on auto insurers in 2019 after it was imposed by the previous NDP government. ""They were able to do this because the UCP removed the cap we put in place to limit increases to premiums,"" said Ganley. ""That's $385 million more out of the pockets of Alberta drivers in a single year. No wonder the UCP tried to hide the report before we called them out on it. No wonder they tried to bury it ahead of a long weekend."" The NDP has accused the government of attempting to suppress the superintendent's report for 2020 and 2021, which have been produced for more than 100 years. Ganley said the increases came during a year when many people parked their cars due to the pandemic and hardly drove. Despite that, they still saw rate increases, she said. ""Alberta drivers, when you look at your car insurance bill, remember that you are getting worked over by an extremely profitable corporation with the help of the UCP,"" said Ganley. Kassandra Kitz, press secretary to Finance Minister Travis Toews, said that since much of the information in the report is publicly available elsewhere, the office of the superintendent had paused the release of the annual document while assessing if the report was still necessary. ""They have since taken action to continue the annual report publication,"" said Kitz in an email. Kitz said Albertans deserve an automobile insurance system that is fair, accessible and affordable and that is why the government is committed to examining ways to improve that system. She noted the government introduced Bill 41, the Insurance Amendment Act, which changed regulations around how premiums are calculated. ""We introduced Bill 41 last session that made legislative and regulatory changes to stabilize auto insurance rates, enhance medical care benefits and ensure more options and flexibility for drivers,"" said Kitz. She said seven insurers have filed for rate reductions in 2021 and that across the board, premium rates for private vehicles is down by just under one per cent over the past 12 months. An analysis using industry and regulator data before the report was released Thursday suggested insurance companies had raked in nearly $2.1-billion in profits during the COVID-19 pandemic. An analysis done by actuary Craig Allen that he says is based on figures provided by the Alberta Automobile Insurance Rate Board shows auto insurers in 2020 pocketed $928 million in pre-tax profits and another $1.153 billion the following year. The 2021 figure, said Allen, is based on available numbers for the first half of that year and projections for the remainder. ""My estimate of what the profit's going to be is fairly conservative, cautious,"" he said. ""The COVID-19 pandemic and reduction in traffic certainly through the first half of 2021 that reduced the volume of accidents and claims is the real main driver."" The analysis was conducted for the group Fair Alberta, which includes lawyers, medical professionals and injured Albertans. An insurance industry spokesman echoed the nearly one per cent rate decrease cited by Kitz, adding Allen's numbers are incomplete and skewed. He said it doesn't include more than $100 million in vehicle damage claims from the June 2020 hail storm that ravaged northeast Calgary and more vehicular traffic and probably more eventual payouts in the second half of last year. ""It's inappropriate to take a point in time and extrapolate it for an entire year ... it's not necessarily accurate,"" said Aaron Sutherland, vice-president of the Insurance Bureau of Canada. He said it's illegal for insurance company profits to exceed seven per cent so ""the notion we're making any kind of windfall is fanciful."" With inflation running at nearly six per cent and price increases of car parts and used vehicles far exceeding that, ""we're seeing a lot of pressure on pocketbooks but auto insurance isn't one of them."" He agreed many insurers' financial picture has improved recently but that some companies are doing considerably better than others. dshort@postmedia.com( mailto:dshort@postmedia.com ) BKaufmann@postmedia.com( mailto:BKaufmann@postmedia.com ) More news, fewer ads, faster load time: Get unlimited, ad-lite access to the Calgary Herald, Calgary Sun, National Post and 13 other Canadian news sites for just $14/month or $140/year.

""For the safety and security of our editorial staff working in the region, we are moving them out of the country for now.

301,0,San Francisco's historic Sir Francis Drake hotel has changed its name to the Beacon Grand in bid to cut links with Elizabethan explorer because of his role in the slave trade,1047 words,Mail Online,"* Californian city has recently removed landmarks to Elizabethan explorer amid protests from the Black Lives Matter movement  * Nearby Marin County renamed a high school because his links to the slave trade * Several monuments, including to Confederate General Robert E. Lee, have been removed in the last year The Sir Francis Drake hotel in San Francisco has changed its name over the British explorer's historical links to the slave trade. After shuttering during the Covid pandemic, the 426-room hotel will now reopen as The Beacon Grand following a huge renovation project. The 94-year-old landmark in the city's Union Square is the latest to bow to pressure following the rise of the Black Lives Matter Movement in June 2020 - which caused hundreds of historic statues to be toppled and names to be changed. Built almost a century ago, the Sir Francis Drake has attracted Hollywood royalty through its doors, flanked by Beefeater doormen in tribute to the seafaring explorer who discovered nearby Drakes Bay over 400 years ago. San Francisco and neighboring Marin County named several landmarks to the English explorer following his voyage to the Californian coast while circumnavigating the world between 1577 and 1580. Drake however also went on trips to Africa, where he is said to have enslaved thousands of Africans to be taken to Britain and the Americas - which was highlighted by protestors last year. Critics then spoke out, saying Drakeâs name should not be on local landmarks because of his ties to slave trading and colonialism. A spokeswoman for the Northview Hotel Group, which bought the hotel last year for about $157 million, confirmed Drake's name was being dropped on Saturday. Tom Sweeney, a doorman at the hotel for 43 years said of the name change: 'Everybody knew the Sir Francis Drake, it was world-known. 'Itâs going to be a sad day in San Francisco for sure ï¿½?I think people will be pretty shocked to see a new name.' Leah Goldstein, public relations manager for the hotel, added: 'Everything was done with so much thought for such an iconic property. We are not just changing the name and then quickly changing everything about the hotel. It is all much more intentional than that.' It's the latest Bay Area landmark to drop Drake's name, following protests across the US by anti-racism campaigners including the Black Lives Matter movement. Last year, Marin County officials removed [https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Sir-Francis-Drake-sculpture-removed-from-Larkspur-15443255.php]a 30-foot-tall steel artwork of Drake at Larkspur Landing 'in response to planned demonstrations to tear down or demolish the statue' by protestors. Just hours later, workers were seen tearing down [https://abc7news.com/sir-francis-drake-high-school-tamalpais-union-district-hs-marin-county-sculpture/6341354/?fbclid=IwAR2P-XSe1CGJhArtILomfHlnDzDnQSEZtt85qIXnzmRslMh7DjNGarGYxr0] the sign on the front of Sir Francis Drake High School in San Anselmo. It has been renamed after a former math and computing teacher Archie Williams, who was also a gold medalist in the 1936 Summer Olympics and one of the first African-American meteorologists. Former student Federal Sousa said he was astonished at the name being removed. 'I just find it so shocking that some of the history is gone,' Sousa told CBS [https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/07/29/work-crews-remove-sir-francis-drake-statue-from-larkspur-landing/]at the time. 'I donât necessarily agree with history, but itâs a part of Marin Countyâs history. I donât like all history, but itâs history. Itâs not pretty.' Not every link to the 16th century explorer has been removed however. In March 2021, Marin County council members voted 4-1 to reject a proposal to rename Sir Francis Drake Boulevard which runs from the Bay Area to the Pacific coast. To confuse matters however, Fairfax Town Council has decided to change the name along its 2-mile section of the road. How Elizabethan naval officer Sir Francis Drake helped defeat the Spanish Armada and was the first Englishman to circumnavigate the world Sir Francis Drake was an English admiral who circumnavigated the globe - and is recognised as the most renowned seaman of the Elizabethan Age. Drake joined one of the first English slaving voyages as part of a fleet led by his cousin John Hawkins in 1567, bringing African slaves to work in the 'New World'. All but two ships of the expedition were lost when the fleet was attacked by the Spanish - who thus became a lifelong enemy for Drake. In 1572, the seaman commanded two vessels in a marauding expedition against Spanish ports in the Caribbean. He captured the port of Nombre de Dios on the Isthmus of Panama, and returned to England with a cargo of Spanish treasure. Following the success of the raid, Drake was secretly commissioned by Queen Elizabeth I to set off from what is now known as Drake's Island on an expedition against the Spanish colonies in 1577. Drake reached the Pacific Ocean in October 1578 with only one of his five boats, the Pelican, remaining. He was the first Englishman to navigate the Straits of Magellan. The seaman used plans created by Sir Richard Grenville, an English sailor who died at the Battle of Flores in 1591, in his expedition. He travelled up the length of the South American coast, plundering Spanish ports, and hoping to find a route to the Atlantic Ocean. Drake navigated further up the west coast of America than any European before him, landing on the coast of California in June 1579. He then turned south in July 1579 and beginning a voyage across the Pacific with his lone ship, now renamed the Golden Hind. A few months later, he reached Moluccas, a group of islands in the western Pacific, in eastern modern-day Indonesia. On 26 September, the Golden Hind sailed back into Plymouth with Drake and his 59 remaining crew aboard, along with a rich cargo of spices and captured Spanish treasures. The sailor was hailed as the first Englishman to circumnavigate the Earth, and he was knighted aboard his ship in April 1581.

603,0,Omicron lowers sales and threatens bankruptcy for US restaurants,380 words,The Boston Globe,"The sharp hit to restaurants nationwide demonstrates the pandemic's continuing blow to the industry, despite national efforts to avoid economic pitfalls from shutdowns this winter. The impact is particularly challenging for businesses that didn't get funding from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, a $28.6 billion federal effort to rescue struggling businesses that was part of the American Rescue Fund. Four out of five businesses that did not receive grants said they were in danger of permanently closing in 2022. The fund provided as much as $5 million per location for restaurant owners -- or as much as $10 million per business -- who could demonstrate their businesses experienced significant financial distress during the pandemic. Restaurateur Dwayne Allen, owner of The Breadfuit in Phoenix, Arizona, said the pandemic forced him to shut down in-restaurant dining in March 2020. For the past two years, he worked to keep the business afloat by introducing catering, take-out, pop-ups and community partnerships. He applied for an RRF grant, but did not receive one. Now, Allen said the efforts to keep the restaurant afloat brought him into tens of thousands of dollars of debt, and he's losing hope of ever reopening the restaurant without external financial support. In addition to a drop in sales, restaurants also struggled with staffing shortages and increased costs due to rising wages. Nearly half of restaurants that did not receive pandemic relief said they were forced to lay off staff because of the surge in cases, compared to a third of those who did receive funding. Nearly half of restaurants also said that the cost and availability of COVID tests impacted their ability to do business."

49,0,New park planned for closed ski resort // Val Chatel redevelopment near Park Rapids comes thanks to anonymous gift.,749 words,Star-Tribune,"âThe property has just tremendous potential.ï¿½?Lohmeier said he has applied to the Greater Minnesota Regional Parks and Trails Commission to designate the property as a regional park, which opens up sources of state funding. The trust orchestrates six to 12 land deals a year around the state but this one was unusual for being privately funded, said Bob McGillivray, the trustâs land protection director in St. Paul. He would say only that the donor is âfrom the greater Twin Cities area.ï¿½?The gift accomplishes multiple goals, McGillivray said. It protects an area of high biodiversity, while adding public access so people can enjoy it. The land hosts several native plant communities such as sedge meadow and oak-aspen-red maple forest, he said. Situated at the foot of a geologic tunnel valley, the waters of Deep Lake stretch as much as 80 feet from the surface to the bottom. There are stands of majestic red and white pines. The park will also connect to nearby trails such as the North Country Trail and Itasca-Heartland Connection Trail. It will also help link county land with a 2,560-acre parcel the trust hopes to eventually add to the Paul Bunyan State Forest. McGillivray and Lohmeier said the campground will fill a need for visitors to Itasca State Park, about 15 miles away. âTrying to get in there is almost impossible,ï¿½?Lohmeier said. The new park, he said. âis another option for people.ï¿½?Minneapolis-based SRF Consulting Group is developing a campground master plan. The campground will be set back from Deep Lake, Lohmeier said, and likely have separate areas for larger RVs, smaller campers and tents, spots near the lake and more primitive pack-in or canoe sites scattered around the lakeâs edge. They may add some camper cabins, he said. Some of the old Val Chatel buildings will have to come down, he said. Rodney and Helen Peterson built the alpine-themed wonderland that first opened in the mid-1950s. Rodney was the artist, Helen the business mind and chef. Minnesotaâs ski culture was more vibrant and less exclusive in those years, said their son, Jim Peterson, who lives with his wife, Sharon, and his mother, Helen, in Park Rapids. He recalled young people skiing there for $1 on âschool night.ï¿½?Yodeling music played in the gingerbread-trim lodge, which had some guest rooms, a stone fireplace in the lobby and a supper club upstairs. A flock of goats wandered the grounds for a time. Both Sharon and Jim broke their legs skiing there, they said. Val Chatel closed in the 1980s after Helen and Rodney went their separate ways. Jim said the land changed hands several times, and none of the business ventures that followed really panned out. The family is thrilled that someone will be caring for the land that was such a foundation in their lives. âThere is quite a history there: Love, hate, birth, death, good times and very dark, bad times,ï¿½?Sharon Peterson said. âAll of it shifted out and manifested into a beautiful legacy, treasured by thousands. We are all so happy that the public will be allowed to enjoy it again.ï¿½?Still, the sale is somewhat bittersweet for Helen. âIt bankrupted her,ï¿½?she said, âand here now itâs selling for more than $1 million.ï¿½?Jennifer Bjorhus ï¿½?612-673-4683"

130,0,Surge of Omicron Infections Prompts Lockdowns in China,1450 words,NYTimes.com Feed,"China is grappling with its largest surge of Covid-19 infections since the coronavirus first emerged more than two years ago in central China. Sustained outbreaks in two-thirds of the countryâs provinces are proving the toughest test yet of Chinaâs zero-tolerance coronavirus policy. Even as countries in the West are now loosening or abandoning mask mandates and other measures, Chinese officials are implementing some of their most stringent methods. That is in large part because China canât afford to lift restrictions. The government has been concerned about comparatively lower rates of vaccination among Chinaâs older adults. The country also has far fewer intensive care hospital beds compared to its population than most industrialized countries. In Chinaâs vast rural areas, hospitals and medical facilities are often basic, and a major outbreak could quickly overwhelm hospitals. The United States and other Western countries have suffered far higher rates of infection and deaths over the past two years than China, and still have higher rates now. But the seven-day average rate of new cases in mainland China, now at 1,584, has more than quintupled in recent days. For many residents in China, the rapid spread of the virus has been unsettling. âBecause of the large number of cases in a short period of time, it is inevitable that there will be some panic all over the country, and Shanghai is no exception,ï¿½?said Dr. Zhang Wenhong, a prominent infectious disease expert in Shanghai, in a post on his social media account on Monday. China has responded to the current surge in cases by mobilizing its vast Communist Party apparatus to deploy workers and resources. In Jilin Province, where many cases have been recorded, workers are building temporary facilities [https://weibo.com/2656274875/LjE4zni24?refer_flag=1001030103_] to house thousands of people who test positive. Across the country, workers are corralling and testing millions of citizens every day. But that testing program is starting to be overwhelmed. âWe have noticed that there have been problems such as long lines and slow test results at many testing sites in the past two days,ï¿½?said Lu Taohong, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, at a news conference on Sunday night. Chinaâs virus containment strategy is focused on moving quickly to lock down buildings or neighborhoods. In response to even a single case, officials may seal all the entrances to a store, office building or even convention center. Everyone inside must then stay there for up to several days as they are tested for the coronavirus and sent into isolation if their results are positive. In Shanghai, many foreign-owned businesses stockpiled mattresses last week in case their employees were trapped in their factories or their offices this week. Multinationals there then told their employees to work from home this week. In Guangzhou, the municipal government on Friday sealed off the worldâs largest convention center, which was holding a beauty products exhibition. Videos circulating on Chinese social media platforms showed crowds of stranded convention goers milling around and looking for exits in attempts to evade the lockdown. The outbreakâs rapid spread and the governmentâs tough response have left some residents worried about the effect of lockdowns on their livelihoods. Li Yanhua, a grocery store manager in Shanghai, was notified on Saturday night that his neighborhood was locked down and residents would have to be tested for Covid. âIt was all of a sudden, we are not even prepared ï¿½?my family has not enough vegetables and daily necessities,ï¿½?Mr. Li said. âMy store is closed, but we still need to pay rent.ï¿½?Still, such measures have also been widely accepted as necessary for the good of public health. Li Junyan, a 33-year-old businessman in the locked down city of Changchun in northeastern China, has had to stop shipping fruit and health products to online customers because of travel restrictions but he is philosophical about it. âThere must be losses to my business, but there is nothing much I can do,ï¿½?he said. He and the other three other members of his family have been confined at their apartment since Saturday. âIn order not to cause chaos to the society, Iâll stay at home for the publicâs sake.ï¿½?Faye Li, 27, a brand management specialist at a food company in Shenzhen, said she wanted to spend time downtown over the weekend with two friends but canceled the plan because the government banned indoor dining. But she accepted this. âThe effect of the outbreak is small, and Iâm actually not very worried, ï¿½?Ms. Li said. âIâve been used to this.ï¿½?Chinese doctors and health officials insist that continued mass testing, quarantines and lockdowns are necessary. Opening up too soon could be disastrous, they warn. Many of the cases in recent days have been the Omicron variant, which while highly transmissible, has also tended to make people less sick than earlier variants of the coronavirus. A little more than half of those infected with the coronavirus in recent days in China do not show symptoms, according to data released by the government. But they are still infectious. âThe proportion of asymptomatic infections is high, the spread is hidden, and early detection is difficult,ï¿½?said Wu Fan, vice dean of Shanghai Medical College at Fudan University, at a government news conference on Sunday. âIt is not enough to simply screen in key areas or populations ï¿½?it is necessary to reduce or slow down the mobility of people.ï¿½?After scandals involving citywide lockdowns [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/world/asia/china-xian-lockdown-covid.html] in which people went hungry in their homes or even died for lack of medical care, notably in Xiâan, central government leaders have ordered local officials to use greater caution when imposing such restrictions. Premier Li Keqiang said in an annual policy speech last week that the goal of Chinaâs pandemic policies was âto protect peopleâs life and health, keep up the normal running of work and life, and ensure the security of industrial and supply chains.ï¿½?But the rapid increase in infections threatens to undo that progress. Dr. Zhang, the Shanghai expert, has been one of the few prominent advocates [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/business/covid-china-zhang-wenhong-coronavirus.html] of easing âCovid zeroï¿½?precautions, but even he said in an online posting on Monday that now is not the time for that. âIt is very important for our country to continue to adopt the strategy of covid-zero in the society in the near future to suppress the fifth wave of the extremely fast-spreading Omicron epidemic to a completely controllable level,ï¿½?he wrote. âBut this does not mean that we will permanently adopt the strategy of citywide lockdown and full testing.ï¿½?Shenzhen, a vast metropolis of nearly 20 million people that is Chinaâs tech center and adjacent to Hong Kong, locked down residents on Sunday night. It stopped buses and subways and ordered businesses to close except for supermarkets, farmersï¿½?markets, pharmacies, medical institutions and the port, which is one of the worldâs largest. Dongguan, another huge factory city that is next to Shenzhen, imposed a similar lockdown on Monday. Particularly in southern China, many have reacted to the Omicron outbreak by blaming nearby Hong Kong, where a large epidemic [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/13/world/asia/hong-kong-quarantine.html] has overwhelmed hospitals and morgues, largely because the vaccination of older residents has lagged. Hu Xijin, a nationalistic columnist, complained in a post on his social media account on Sunday: âHong Kong brought down Shenzhen.ï¿½?Li You, Amy Chang Chien, and Joy Dong contributed research.

Shanghai Disneyland closed as the virus spread throughout China in early 2020 and reopened in May that year. China recorded 2,027 confirmed coronavirus cases on Sunday, with 1,947 local transmissions, including more than 1,000 in the hard-hit northeast province of Jilin, where the two Covid deaths were reported on Saturday. Jilin banned its 24 million residents from leaving the province or traveling between cities because of the surging case numbers there. Major commercial cities, including Shanghai and Shenzhen, have also closed schools and offices in some areas, and transport problems have strained supply chains. Last week, Chinaâs leader, Xi Jinping, urged officials to try to limit the economic fallout even as they rushed to stifle outbreaks. While cities in Jilin continue to enforce stringent controls in many areas, Shenzhen, which is next to Hong Kong, announced that from Monday it would start adjusting restrictions to allow as many as employees and businesses to get back to work. Couriers, taxi drivers and building laborers in many areas could use a daily testing system to return to work, the cityâs government said.

898,0,Briefing: Mixed reaction over lifting of Twitter ban in Nigeria,618 words,BBC Monitoring Africa,"- Nigerian government lifts ban Twitter saying the microblogging site had met its conditions - Local media widely covers the resumption of Twitter services, focusing on losses and reactions - Government officials begin using Twitter again, as Nigerians say the 2023 elections are a major reason for the lifting of the ban Full story On 13 January the Nigerian government lifted the seven-month suspension on the operations in the country of the microblogging site, Twitter. The director-general of the National Information Technology Development Agency, Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, who lifted the ban, said in a statement that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved the decision. The ban was prompted by the deletion of a post on Buhari's account in June 2021 for violating the site's guidelines. The social media platform has said it is ""pleased"" that its services had been restored, adding that it was ""deeply committed to Nigeria, where Twitter is used by people for commerce, cultural engagement, and civic participation"". Following the ban, Nigerians downloaded virtual private networks (VPN) in order to use Twitter, as the government formed a committee to engage with the social media platform. Abdullahi said Twitter had largely agreed to the demands of the government, including operating within the laws of Nigeria and meeting tax obligations. The ban on the microblogging platform was condemned by many Nigerians, human rights groups and foreign governments as an attack on freedom of expression.  Twitter was instrumental in mobilising reform protests dubbed #EndSars. Nigerian media reporting on the lifting of the ban The resumption of Twitter activities was widely covered by local media outlets, and at least one reported that the ban was likely to be lifted, two days prior. Privately-owned TVC News reported on 10 January that Twitter had met the federal authorities' requirements.  The Guardian website focused on the economic losses incurred by business in Nigeria, estimated at $1.3 billion, according to NetBlocks Cost of Shutdown Tool. The Daily Trust website largely reported from Abdulahi's statement, but gave prominence to reasons for the suspension of services, and the fact that Twitter had met the government's conditions. The authorities had said the ban was due to the use of the platform to spread fake news and ""polarise Nigerians along tribal and religious lines, among others"". Sahara Reporters published at least three reports on the lifting of the ban. It reported on Twitter's reaction to lifting of the suspension, the activities of government officials on the platform, and reactions by citizens to them. Channels TV website published a timeline of the Twitter ban and a reaction from Amnesty International saying the suspension of the site's services was illegal and deprived Nigerians of their freedom of expression. Government and public reaction The Nigerian presidency's Twitter handle, @NGRPresident, was one of those that started posting tweets after the suspension was lifted. Buhari's spokesperson, Garba Shehu, posted a ""welcome back"" message that touted the ""gains"" made from the ""national sacrifice"". But his tweet was widely criticised by Nigerians, some of whom said they had bypassed the ban using VPNs. At least one media outlet, The Nation, observed the Twitter ban, and resumed posting on 13 January after the last tweet on 5 June 2021. Nigerians used the hash tags #Twitterban and #TwitterBanLifted to comment on the development. Many users linked the return of the platfrom to the upcoming 2023 elections.  Twitter user @nelhigiator said: Welcome back to Twitter officially. 2023 is behind [sic] the corner. Nigerians get ready to vote right with your PVC [voter's card].

505,0,Restaurants in Kashmir struggling to survive amid Covid lockdown: Hoteliers' body,486 words,Hindustan Times,"He said that amid a surge in Covid cases in Kashmir, the people associated with the restaurant business are in distress fearing an upsurge in cases will dent their businesses badly. ""In winter months the business usually remains down, but we had high expectations from the coming months which now will be spoiled by the spread of Covid, "" he said. He further said that the business and footfall of customers has nosedived and the online orders and takeaways business has also been affected. ""Everyone has been affected in one or another way. Although all the members of our association follow all the SOPs as directed by district administrations from time to time and during the past few years it was already challenging and now business was back to normal but this new wave has crippled the business in a huge way,"" he said. Owing to the surge in cases this month, the administration in J&K has posed restrictions on non-essential activities from Friday afternoon to Monday morning every week. Sheikh Feroz further said, ""In the past few years, like other businesses, restaurants and cafes switched to online delivery systems but as the Covid affected the dine-in, it has also impacted the online delivery and takeaways."" ""Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic all the business activities came to standstill and it is our moral duty to keep the safety of clients and ourselves in this turbulent time on top priority,"" he said. He said that during the last two lockdown of Covid-19 pandemic in India and abroad, The restaurant and cafe business reeled under this challenge particularly because a large number of them are small to medium scale businesses with limited capacity to sustain through long periods of slow business. ""Last year we met the deputy commissioner, Srinagar, and explained how the restaurant industry in Kashmir is struggling with losses in Covid-19 lockdown. Till now, the owners of the restaurants were somehow managing to pay the salaries and other exigencies, but now it is becoming extremely difficult for them to continue making the payments without the businesses running,"" the president said.

The company is focused on those who produce and those who consume, and this centre will help farmers boost productivity while meeting consumer demand for a more sustainable agriculture."
306,0,Un-app-etizing biz Delivery services in trouble,905 words,New York Post,"With city's economy in the tank during late 2020 and early 2021, startups were able to score sweet short-term deals on spaces, but things are now changing as rents begin to rise and local politicians question if the apps are turning once-bustling streets into warehousing and delivery zones. Obstacles ""They've run into a number of obstacles between rising rents, potential zoning issues and landlords who are not excited about them as tenants because they don't add anything to the neighborhood,"" Jeffrey Roseman, vice chairman of commercial real-estate advisory Newmark Group, told The Post. Amid the pandemic, which left many well-to-do New Yorkers cowering inside and ordering everything online, fast-delivery apps scooped up between 150 and 200 retail spaces since charging into the city about 12 months ago, according to Solomon Sharaby, a broker with KSR, the real-estate company that handled Jokr's expansion in New York. Many of the deals were unusually short leases with cancellation options for both the landlords and tenants, brokers say. ""The landlords wanted the ability to cancel the lease because it wasn't their ideal tenant and the delivery companies wanted a way out in case they couldn't make it in the market,"" broker Yoni Hader told The Post. As the economy improves, more landlords are spurning deals with dark stores, which some say don't add to foot traffic and, with their throngs of e-bikes, can annoy neighbors. ""A store with a sign that's not open to the public and the delivery bikes gathered outside is a challenge,"" broker Brian Katz of Katz & Associates told The Post. Adding to the complications, some delivery apps, which had raised billions of dollars in venture capital during the earlier days of the pandemic, are starting to run out of money. One lesser-funded app, 1520, launched in January 2021 and shut down by December after running out of funding. None of the apps, which primarily use full-time employees rather than gig workers, appears to be profitable. New York politicians are adding to the apps' woes, fretting about their impact on local businesses and questioning if they're flouting zoning laws and other city rules. Many of the apps have secured spaces zoned for retail businesses - not warehouses - but are effectively operating warehouses anyway, according to Upper West Side Councilwoman and former Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer. ""I don't see how [dark stores] could be legal in a retail area,"" Brewer told The Post. ""They're warehouses."" She said she's asked the city's Department of Buildings and Department of City Planning to investigate if delivery apps are violating zoning laws, and could also introduce legislation around the issue. 'Violating city law' Brewer and Christopher Marte, a councilman representing downtown Manhattan, said they had visited locations by competitors such as Getir and Gorillas, and were either unable to enter or unable to buy items with cash, in violation of city law. Philadelphia-based Gopuff, which opened more than 20 locations in the Big Apple since October, has apparently tried to dodge zoning concerns by opening small retail zones that are open to the public. The Post visited one of those sites, on Rivington Street in the Lower East Side, last week. The store's posted hours showed it was open, but no employees were attending the store, which appeared to consist of two refrigerators stocked with fruits, vegetables, juices and yogurt. The grocery items appeared to not have price labels, which Brewer points out are required under city law. The Rivington location consists largely of rows and rows of shelves that are only accessible to company employees. Still, a Gopuff spokesperson insisted to The Post that the company's New York locations ""are not 'dark stores' or 'warehouses,'"" but rather ""retail locations that support both walk-in customers and pickups for deliveries."" The customer experience will evolve over time, the spokesperson added. But Marte said, ""If it looks like a warehouse, if it sounds like a warehouse, if no one's there to sell you anything, it pretty much is."" He called Gopuff's claims that its New York sites are ""retail locations"" a ""p.r. move."" Roseman said that companies such as Gopuff are scrambling to meet city requirements because having a retail component ""wasn't their business model before they arrived in NYC."" lfickenscher@nypost.com"
53,0,Burger King's attempts to shutter its Russia operations are thwarted after its joint venture partner 'refused' to close 800 restaurants,514 words,Business Insider,"* Parent company RBI owns just 15% of the joint venture partnership behind its Russian restaurants.  Burger King's attempts to close its Russian operation have been thwarted after the operator of its 800 outlets in the country said he is unable to close them because he doesn't have the necessary shareholder backing to do so, the BBC reported. The company's Russian business is carried out through a joint venture partnership with Alexander Kolobov, who oversees the restaurants' day-to-day operations, investment firm Investment Capital Ukraine, and VTB Capital, an affiliate of Russia's second-business bank. Restaurant Brands International, Burger King's parent, has a 15% stake in the joint venture. Kolobov told the BBC[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60789772?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA] that he owns a 30% stake in the business and that he himself didn't have the ""authority or power"" to stop Burger King's Russian operations. ""The decision to terminate and suspend operations of the franchisee which employs about 25,000 persons must be taken by all shareholders considering impact it may have on the employees and their families,"" Kolobov told the BBC on Sunday.  Restaurant Brands International and Burger King did not immediately reply to requests for comment from Insider. His remarks to the BBC followed a statement made by the president of Restaurant Brands International on Thursday[https://www.rbi.com/English/news/news-details/2022/Actions-on-Burger-King-Russia/default.aspx] in which he said that the company had tried to have the restaurants close but was unsuccessful. ""We contacted the main operator of the business and demanded the suspension of Burger King restaurant operations in Russia,"" RBI President David Shear said. ""They have refused to do so."" Western companies have been scrambling to pull out of Russia[https://www.businessinsider.com/list-all-the-companies-pulling-out-of-russia-ukraine-war-2022-3?r=US&IR=T] since the country invaded Ukraine in late February.

In the meantime, RBI has removed all corporate support for its Russian restaurants, including operations, marketing, and supply-chain support, and won't approve any new investment or expansion, he said. It's not just Burger King facing this problem. Insider reported that some McDonald's and Papa John's[https://www.businessinsider.com/why-mcdonalds-burger-king-papa-johns-cant-close-russia-restaurants-2022-3?r=US&IR=T] outlets in Russia have remained open due to franchise agreements with third-party operators.

486,0,No cheap thrills State quashes 25-cent martinis,403 words,New York Post,"That meant the deal, which was offered during lunchtime this month on Wednesdays through Fridays was actually illegal - and it's no more. ""The place was packed. It broke the Internet,"" said Marie Assante, a food publicist who dined at Anton's last Thursday. ""I've never seen a lunch spot as crowded and vibrant at 2:45 p.m. as I did last Thursday. People were celebrating with friends or working remotely on their computers."" The SLA didn't charge Anton's with an official violation, but let the restaurant off with a warning, a spokesperson told Side Dish. Even though some state laws around liquor have been relaxed during the pandemic - like the to-go drinks that Gov. Hochul says she wants to make permanent - there are still strict rules in place for the selling of alcohol. Nick Anderer, a co-owner of Anton's, wouldn't comment to Side Dish, but an Instagram post confirmed that the state had intervened in the restaurant's 25-cent special, which owners told Side Dish last week had been inspired by a New Orleans group of establishments that had done the same thing to goose business. ""Due to an obscure NY State liquor law, of which we were completely unaware, and for which we received no warning or notice, we can no longer offer 25 cent martinis and Manhattans,"" Anderer wrote. The new price for martinis and Manhattans: $9 during lunch hours. ""Apparently, 'special' prices on liquor/wine cannot be offered any lower than 50% of an establishment's regular pricing,"" Anderer explained. jgould@nypost.com"
227,0,Ultra-rich Russians desert ski capital,828 words,The Times,"Filippo Casaccia, coowner of the Ski 5 Star school, said instructors had seen cancellations from ""very important guys from Russia"". He said he believes they have cancelled because they are ""at risk if [they are] here and also afraid of being spotted here"". While the few who remained quaffed bottles of aprÃ¨s-ski champagne as their compatriots engaged in war this week, locals estimated that the number of Russians was down by 90 per cent. Gosia, 44, a regular from Poland, said that she had been surprised. ""Two weeks ago there were hundreds here and right now they have disappeared they have escaped,"" she said. She described being infuriated after watching some Russian guests continuing to party at Le Tremplin, a restaurant where jeroboams of wine cost up to ï¿½?0,000. ""Those who are travelling are absolutely aware of what is happening. They are taking advantage and it really inappropriate for them to be here,"" she said. While many Russians who did stay kept a low profile, the wife of one oligarch was not cowed. Ilona Kotelyukh, whose billionaire husband Nikolai Sarkisov is the coowner of Reso-Garantia, one of Russia's biggest insurance firms, beamed while posing in designer ski gear this week. The social media influencer lashed out at critics of her stay at the resort, which she called ""my oasis"", pointing out that their children had been ill and griping about the journey to Geneva. Kotelyukh, 29, complained about Russian and Belarusian athletes being banned from the Winter Paralympics. She directly addressed the situation in Ukraine, calling the family ""ordinary people"" who do not want war and questioning why she had been subjected to threats. She wrote: ""While some people think we are having a good time in Courchevel, my children have been ill the whole week. [My son] has a temperature ... I'm running around. Geneva is a two-and-a-half-hour journey there and back."" The mother of two, who said she had relatives in Ukraine, added: ""We all love our life and our lands. We love our Russian, Armenia[n], Ukrainian, Polish and Belarusian people. We will never partition anyone. And my children will grow up with this position."" Images online last week showed the Russian and Ukrainian flags being waved as partygoers danced and were offered champagne at Bagatelle, a high-end restaurant. The images were captured by the Russiabased hotelier Inna Alexandrovna, who noted that she is half-Ukrainian. Alexandrovna captured herself dancing on tables with friends, quaffing wine and eating at expensive restaurants. The situation is a dramatic departure for the resort, which garnered the nickname ""Courchevelski"" for its popularity with bigspending Russians, whose language adorns the menus at many of its fivestar hotels. Within 48 hours of the Ukraine invasion, staff described Russians frantically trying to go home on the private jets and helicopters that service the resort's mountain airport. A hotel employee told The Times that six Russian groups were due to check in on Monday but only two showed up. Courchevel began to attract post-perestroika Russians in the 1990s, led by Roman Abramovich, who would buy Chelsea Football Club in 2003. The ensuing influx continued the resort's evolution into a byword for luxury now with eight Michelin-starred restaurants and three of France's 25 distinguished ""palace"" hotels. The centre of the resort, Courchevel 1850, is lined with designer stores such as Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Balenciaga, as well as art galleries, diamond sellers and fur boutiques. Jean-Yves Pachod, the mayor, would not discuss the future of Russian tourism in the resort, citing the situation as too ""complex"". There is speculation about the future of the so-called ""super chalets"" in the resort owned by wealthy Russians after the French authorities vowed this week to seize assets linked to the Kremlin. Last year a company linked to Sarkisov, 53, paid ï¿½?4 million for a chalet with a pool, gym and private cinema. The businessman of Armenian descent who was listed 1,465th on Forbes's 2014 billionaires list previously coconstructed another chalet for ï¿½?4 million. The drop-off in visitors is partially explained by the travel ban on Russian flights enforced in Europe as the invasion began, as well as the EU's refusal to accept the Sputnik Covid-19 vaccine. Locals, however, point out that many of the Russian guests are based in Europe, travelling to the resort from homes in London, Paris and Monaco."
303,0,Delhi Covid Restrictions: DDMA likely to meet on Friday to discuss lifting of remaining Coronavirus curbs,459 words,Financial Express Online,"However, restrictions like only one weekly market permitted in a municipal zone, no standing passengers in buses and metro trains, 50 per cent cap on seating capacity in restaurants, bars and cinemas, and no activity except weddings in banquet halls, are yet to be relaxed. ""The fresh cases of Covid as well as positivity rate have gone down much compared to the peak of the pandemic in January. The DDMA (Delhi Disaster Management Authority) is likely to meet coming Friday to discuss lifting remaining restrictions,"" said an official source on Tuesday. The DDMA in its meeting on February 4 extended imposition of night curfew from 11 PM instead of 10 PM to 5 AM. Demands have been raised from several quarters to lift the remaining restrictions citing normalising of the Covid situation in the city. The Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI), an association of traders in Delhi, has written a letter to DDMA Chairman and Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal demanding that a meeting of the DDMA should be convened at the earliest. ""If Covid cases and the infection rate are decreasing in the capital, then the rest of the restrictions should be completely removed,"" the organisation has said. ""There has been a positivity rate of less than one per cent in Delhi. On Monday, only 360 new cases of the coronavirus came. Beds are lying vacant in hospitals. The wave of the coronavirus in Delhi is nearing its end,"" said CTI chairman Brijesh Goyal and president Subhash Khandelwal. Currently, there is night curfew from 11 pm to 5 am that causes a lot of problems. Shops in Delhi markets are allowed to open till 8 pm. Its time should also increase, they said. Goyal said that people associated with the event and exhibition industry are also worried. They are unable to work, he said. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta has also written to Baijal requesting him to allow visitors in temples and other religious places. Currently religious places are permitted to open without visitors.  ""If Covid cases and the infection rate are decreasing in the capital, then the rest of the restrictions should be completely removed,"" the organisation has said.

The IOC and host nation Japan are still confident that the Games will go ahead as planned, but no one has any real idea on how long this might go on for. Just from athletes I have spoken to, there is definitely real concern over the Games. The concern isnât just over whether the games get cancelled or not. For each individual athlete, it is also over their own preparations. As an athlete, getting sick is never great and if you got this virus bad you might face missing weeks of training. It could result on you missing the podium in Tokyo.? Or missing the Games altogether. Another friend of mine told me of his concerns that if they move the Games then he might not even get selected.? With markets crashing and supermarket shelves being cleared, these are definitely interesting times for everybody. But when you are living during this Covid-19 pandemic with a spinal-cord injury I guess it becomes even more daunting ï¿½?as such an injury can remove your cough and sneeze reflex. With very little core function, the thought of not being able to cough is a pretty scary proposition.? This might not sound too bad. But this virus hits elderly people hard ï¿½?and this also includes your biological age due to underlying medical conditions. So this is a scary time, and I completely feel for everyone in the same boat as me how scary this is.?I remember back to catching the flu in November last year ï¿½?I thought I was going to stop breathing. I couldnât cough to clear my lungs as the level of my injury is right at the nerves which go to the lungs.? It knocked me out for weeks, so I would be lying if I said I wasnât slightly scared of Covid-19 and its possible effects on my lungs.? I am a very optimistic person who always looks for solutions over problems. But I must admit this has got me a little bit shaken.? Watching whatâs happening in Italy has been hard to believe ï¿½?particularly as life seemed to be continuing almost as normal here.? I looked at the MRI of a 44-year-old manâs lungs and it was unbelievable, unfortunately he didnât survive.? So I am staying positive but also taking advice from Austrian neurologist Viktor Frankl.?He speaks of acceptance of your current situation. These are his own words ï¿½?which I have had on my wall for the last four years: âThe meaning of life lies in finding a purpose and taking responsibility for ourselves and other human beings.ï¿½? In other words, by having a clear âwhyï¿½?we can face all the âhowï¿½?questions of life. This has got me through all those hours in hospital and continues to serve me daily.? Thereâs a reason that in-flight safety presentations always instruct us to secure our own oxygen masks before assisting fellow passengers. We canât help others effectively unless we first protect ourselves. So I spoke with a medical oncologist friend and they advised me to self-isolate.? I am now on day four and thinking this could be a long road ahead; thankfully the weather is getting warmer and I got out on my bike for a few laps of Richmond Park. Along with indoor turbo sessions I am well prepared mentally for the process. I guess all my time in hospital equipped my mind to deal with self-isolating. It also probably helps being an introvert.? I canât help but think of the poor people undergoing their cancer treatment right now though, as I prepare for my own hospital appointment in a few weeks, but I am grateful that side of things is under control. My main goal is keeping my immune system strong because another issue I have from my spinal-cord injury is a compromised immune system, thus moving me into a vulnerable group.? Itâs hard to go from a strong athlete to now feeling so vulnerable, but thankfully I have a strong mind."
207,1,World Bank predicts slow growth because of Ukraine war,540 words,The Times of India,"High oil and food prices caused by the war in Ukraine will have a strong negative impact on peoplesï¿½?real incomes,ï¿½?said Hartwig Schafer, World Bank Vice President for South Asia. âGiven these challenges, governments need to carefully plan monetary and fiscal policies to counter external shocks and protect the vulnerable, while laying the foundation for green, resilient and inclusive growth.âThough GDP growth continues to be solid during the recovery, all countries in the region will face challenges ahead. In India, household consumption will be constrained by the incomplete recovery of the labor market and inflationary pressures. Maldives faces vulnerabilities due to its large imports of fossil fuels as a share of GDP and a reduction in tourists from Russia and Ukraine. In Sri Lanka, the economic outlook is highly uncertain due to fiscal and external imbalances. In Afghanistan, higher food prices will exacerbate food insecurity. One of Pakistanâs challenges in the current environment is its energy subsidies, which are the largest in the region. Bangladesh will face weaker demand from Europe for its exports. On a positive note, exports of services from the region are on the rise.The war and its impact on fuel prices can provide the region with much-needed impetus to reduce reliance on fuel imports and transition to a green, resilient and inclusive growth trajectory. The report recommends that countries steer away from inefficient fuel subsidies that tend to benefit wealthier households and deplete public resources. South Asian countries should also move towards a greener economy by gradually introducing taxation that puts tariffs on products which cause environmental damage.âThe introduction of green taxation can have multiple quantifiable benefits for South Asia, including improved energy security, environmental gains and increased fiscal revenues,ï¿½?said Hans Timmer, World Bank Chief Economist for the South Asia Region. âThese revenues could be utilized for adaptation against climate-related disasters and to strengthen social safety net systems.âAnother challenge the region faces is the disproportionate economic impact the pandemic has had on women. The report includes in-depth analysis of gender disparities in the region and their link with deeply rooted social norms, and recommends policies that will support womenâs access to economic opportunities, tackle discriminatory norms, and improve gender outcomes for inclusive growth.

308,1,Intertrust NV - Singapore is changing its work visa rules for foreign employees,927 words,Public Companies News and Documents via PUBT,"Make an enquiry [https://www.intertrustgroup.com/make-an-enquiry/]  A shake-up announced in the 2022 Budget means foreign workers must earn more to qualify for employment passes Foreign white-collar workers taking new jobs in Singapore will face new requirements to qualify for the popular Employment Pass (EP) from later this year. They will need to receive a higher minimum salary and meet a minimum skill points threshold. The changes, announced in the March Budget, will apply to new hirings from September 2022. Applicants must currently be paid a minimum of SGD 4,500 per month. This will rise to SGD 5,000 from 1 September. The threshold will be even higher for prospective workers in financial services, rising from the current SGD 5,000 to SGD 5,500. This reflects higher-than-average salaries in the sector. The EP qualifying salary may be gradually increased until September 2025 and will be benchmarked to the top-third of Singaporean salaries in the professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMET) sector. Who can apply for a Singapore Employment Pass? EPs are open to foreign employees of all nationalities. The minimum salary requirement is only one of the criteria that must be met to qualify. Candidates must also: * Have a job offer in Singapore * Work in the PMET sector and have a managerial or executive role * Show they have a university degree and/or professional qualification What do the Singapore Employment Pass changes mean for employers? All employees must have a valid EP before they start work in Singapore, which employers must apply for on their behalf. Employers will have to ensure that existing EP holders will meet the higher salary threshold from September 2023. Budget changes also affect foreign workers applying for an S Pass, which is designed for mid-level skilled technical staff. New applicants for the S Pass must earn at least SGD 3,000 a month from September 2022. The levy rate for the S Pass will also increase, up from the current SGD 350 to SGD 450 in September 2022, rising progressively to SGD 650 from September 2025. What is Singapore's COMPASS system? From September 2023, new EP applicants will also have to score highly enough under a new COMPASS (Complementarity Assessment Framework) points system to work in Singapore. This will also apply to EP renewals from September 2024. The COMPASS points system requires basic criteria to be met, but employees and employers can earn extra or alternative points in several ways. Individuals must meet the salary requirements and have relevant qualifications. To earn bonus points they must be a candidate for a job where skills shortages exist. Relevant professional qualifications do not have to include a university degree. Employers should be able to show that the foreign hire will improve nationality diversity in their firm and that they employ a higher proportion of local people in managerial roles than their peers.

387,1,Employment falls in Bolton ï¿½?but stays above pre-pandemic levels,526 words,The Bolton News,"In the north west Greater Manchester region, which covers two local authorities, 267,069 people were in payrolled employment in March, ONS figures show. This was down from 267,159 the month before but up from 257,726 in March 2021. At the start of the pandemic, 262,380 people were in payrolled jobs in the area. Different figures show that across the UK, the unemployment rate hit 3.8% in the three months to February ï¿½?it has not been lower than this since 1974. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""The stats show the continued strength of our jobs market, with the number of employees on payrolls rising once again in March and unemployment falling further below pre-pandemic levels."" However, the ONS said real pay was now ""falling noticeably"", with regular wages excluding bonuses tumbling 1.8% after inflation in the three months to February, the steepest decline in almost nine years. Labour has called on Mr Sunak to ""show the leadership the country needs"" amid the cost-of-living crisis, while Frances OâGrady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the Chancellor has done little to help families in the current climate. ""By holding down pay in the public sector and cutting Universal Credit, he has made the crisis worse,"" said Ms O'Grady. ""Families need help now. Whoever is Chancellor tomorrow should go to Parliament with an emergency budget to help with surging energy bills and to get wages rising."" Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, called on the Chancellor to provide more support in the autumn budget, saying: ""The sheer scale of this inflation-led squeeze of living standards makes it all the more remarkable how little support the Chancellor provided in his spring statement"". Mr Sunak acknowledged this is a ""worrying time"" but highlighted the Â£22 billion in support that the Government is providing in 2022-23, including the Household Support fund. Employment minister Mims Davies added the Government is ""doing everything we can to help"", including supporting people in moving into better paid, higher skilled work and increasing the National Living and Minimum Wage. Separate ONS figures also show there has been a fall in the number of people claiming unemployment benefits in the Bolton local authority area over the last year. Around 10,950 people were on out-of-work benefits as of March 10, down by 4,070 from 15,020 at the same point the year before. It meant 6.2% of the area's working population sought support in March. The figures include those aged 16 to 64 on Jobseekerâs Allowance and some Universal Credit claimants, who are unemployed and seeking work or employed but with low earnings."

297,0,Two top restaurants close doors as Covid takes toll on staffing,405 words,The New Zealand Herald,"âWeâve been left with no choice but to close temporarily while so many staff are absent due to Covid regulations,ï¿½?the business said on social media yesterday. âWeâve felt frustrated and helpless, watching Omicron getting rapidly closer. We are committed to giving the full Prego experience and without all our people this is not currently possible.ï¿½?And in yet another blow, Aucklandâs The Grove on St Patrickâs Square in the CBD has also shut temporarily. âIt is with a heavy heart that we announce the temporary closure of The Grove restaurant. Unfortunately some of our staff have been exposed to Covid-19, and our small, hard-working team is unable to operate without a full team,ï¿½?that business announced. Prego, which opened in 1986, serves popular Italian-style cuisine and has had a loyal following for many years. Its courtyard partly enclosed by a wall on Ponsonby Rd is popular and often diners have had to wait to get seats. A phone message at Prego said the business âhad to shut for 10 daysï¿½?but reassured customers by advising them to keep an eye out for it reopening. Customers are already mourning the temporary closure. One described it as heartbreaking and told the business to âhang in thereï¿½? Another said: âIf you need even just one or two extra sets of hands to get open soon, we will be there with bells on.ï¿½?Others said it was what people feared and devastating news. They wished the popular business all the best and said they hoped it would be open again soon. Prego said it has taken every measure it could to minimise the spread of the virus, âsacrificing its brand to follow Government mandates and restrictionsï¿½? âOur team have worked hard to ensure Prego remains a comfortable haven that is safe and familiar, far from the broken world outside. Thanks to each one of you for remaining loyal and positive. Thank you for constantly supporting Prego. We will miss you all but be back before you know it,ï¿½?the business said."
964,0,"Corporate: Hotel sector recovery on track, openings continue amid the pandemic",1260 words,The Edge Malaysia (Weekly),"Consider this: Even as we witnessed the permanent closure of two long-standing hotels last year ï¿½?The Puteri Pacific Hotel in Johor Baru on Aug 30 and Hotel Istana Kuala Lumpur two days later on Sept 1 ï¿½?new hotels and international brands were making their maiden entry into Malaysia. Real estate agency Zerin Propertiesï¿½?Klang Valley Hospitality Sector report dated December 2021 revealed a list of openings in 2021, which included the 186-room Fairfield Kuala Lumpur and 319-apartment Capri Hotel by Fraser. The former 290-room Pullman Putrajaya reopened as the DoubleTree by Hilton Putrajaya while the 151-room Palm Garden Hotel in Putrajaya has been rebranded as a Tribute Portfolio Hotel. Fairfield and Tribute Portfolio are new brands in the market. Upcoming hotel openings this year listed by Zerin Properties include the 232-room Park Hyatt Kuala Lumpur at PNB 118 and the 544-room Conrad Kuala Lumpur (the former MAS headquarters on Jalan Sultan Ismail). Both hotel assets are owned by state-controlled fund Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB). Also slated for opening is the 260-room Kempinski Hotel @ 8 Conlay, 252-room Amari Kuala Lumpur, and 478-room Canopy by Hilton Hotel and DoubleTree by Hilton at i-City in Shah Alam, Selangor. Park Hyatt, Conrad, Kempinski and Canopy are all new hotel brands in the domestic market. âThe opening of hotels during this period sends two very strong signals. First, investors and operators have a strong conviction on the robust domestic demand and, second, they are certain about the long-term potential of the tourism sector in Malaysia,ï¿½?Zerin Properties CEO Previndran Singhe tells The Edge. It is worth pointing out that these openings took place even as the hotel industry performance was at its worst. According to the Malaysian Association of Hotels (MAH), the industry sustained losses to the tune of RM9 billion in the January to September 2021 period compared with RM6 billion in losses for the entire 2020. The industry bled RM300 million every two weeks during the Movement Control Order. In an interview with The Edge, MAH CEO Yap Lip Seng says the industry is on the path to recovery and that he is hopeful tourism will return to pre-pandemic levels, albeit by 2024 at the earliest. âIt seems that recovery should be on track now, with domestic tourism playing a major role over the next one to 1Â½ years before we see significant international arrivals again,ï¿½?Yap says. He believes further hotel closures are unlikely, provided that there are no more travel restrictions. The hospitality industry began to improve as soon as the travel restrictions were eased, giving hotel operators hope that 2021 would end with a higher occupancy rate. âThis also signalled to hotels to reopen and restart,ï¿½?Yap says of hotels that had shut down temporarily. But, towards the end of 2021, concerns over the emergence of the Omicron variant emerged, although it did not have an adverse impact on domestic tourism as many opted to continue with their plans after a long period of staying at home. The average occupancy rate (AOR) peaked at 52% during the last two weeks of the year-end holidays, Yap says, which was decent all things considered. Fortunately, the impact of the floods ï¿½?the worst in 50 years in the Klang Valley ï¿½?was limited. âThe flood had impacted demand from affected areas, with some hotels recording cancellations citing [it] as a reason,ï¿½?he reveals, adding that while it did not have a severe impact on tourism activity overall, it was nevertheless a concern in areas that were affected, both as a source market as well as a destination. âDecember 2021 was definitely better when compared with 2020, with the year-end holiday week peaking at 52% versus the year before at about 42%.ï¿½?The better performance, Yap adds, was also due to pent-up demand as interstate travel restrictions had been in place between January and October last year. The AOR was also encouraging given that it was 21% in January last year, before dipping to 17% in February. March and April were better months as the AOR climbed to 27%, driven by âquarantine needsï¿½? before slipping again to below 18% in the months of May and June. Yap confirms that the locations experiencing speedy recovery are the islands of Langkawi and Penang. âLangkawi continues to be the most popular destination with sufficient capacity and capability to recover, but Penangâs hotel occupancy shot up immediately after travel restrictions were lifted and has been consistent since.ï¿½?During the year-end holidays, Penang even enjoyed an AOR of 70% at one point. This yearâs performance will mostly be supported by domestic tourism âwith hopes of staggered reopening of international tourism by the third quarter from selected countries, via Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) implementation and international travel bubble initiatives,ï¿½?Yap says. He shares two possible scenarios, noting that how the year finishes would depend on whether international borders reopen, given the uncertainties surrounding the Omicron variant. âIf this continues (borders do not open), average occupancy for 2022 will likely not exceed 35%. In terms of average daily rates (ADR), the industry already lost about 40% on average compared with pre-Covid days (depending on factors such as star rating, city hotel versus resort hotel, location). This is not expected to improve in 2022.ï¿½?In the event that international travel fully resumes, Yap hopes it will drive hotel occupancy in the second half, which would boost 2022 AOR to about 50%. As for ADR, he expects the improvement to be minimal as it is expected to only benefit selected hotels with strong international demand. â[This year], despite being marked as a ârecoveryï¿½?year, is in fact [geared towards] operational recovery more than financial recovery. Demand, which will continue to be driven by the domestic market, is not expected to be sufficient to drive profitability as domestic spending power is much lower when compared with foreign spending. 2022 will continue to be a year of survival for the industry,ï¿½?Yap highlights. Touching on hotel openings during the pandemic, he observes that hotel owners took different approaches depending on which stage of development they were in. For developments that had been planned but had yet to commence, while there were no significant decisions made to delay them, there were considerations to re-strategise based on market demand. For near to completion or completed developments during the pandemic, decisions were made to delay their opening. Meanwhile, developments that had commenced with expectations of completion by the time the country transitions to the endemic phase, are expected to be on time. Zerin Propertiesï¿½?list of hotel openings in 2023 in the Klang Valley include So Sofitel Kuala Lumpur Hotel & Residence in Jalan Ampang; Kimpton Hotel at The Tun Razak Exchange; and Hotel Indigo on The Park in Bukit Nanas, Kuala Lumpur. For planned serviced apartments (hotel residences), the list includes Somerset KL Metropolis, Citadines Odeon Kuala Lumpur and Citadines Ara Damansara, Selangor."

Russian intelligence is known to focus on the western social media space, especially in order to drive narratives that benefit Russian interests. Russia is highly concerned about not being able to control the narrative, and the targeting of open-source intelligence accounts proves how important they are in todayâs media environmentï¿½? OSINTtechnical said. Other prominent OSINT accounts echoed the accusations of a cyberattack. Ukrainian account InformNapalm, whose founder Roman Burko was blocked, alleges the attack came during the dissemination of intelligence debunking Russian claims that the Ukrainian army had shelled Russian territory[https://informnapalm.org/en/russian-territory-was-shelled-from-the-russia-occupied-territory-osint-evidence/]. They stated Burkoâs suspension was âprobably a result of a cyberattack from a Russian troll factoryï¿½?in response to their investigation. However, as of yet, no evidence has been produced to confirm these statements and Twitter has not responded to the incident. Analyst Oliver Alexander reported that his account, along with others, was locked for 12 hours from 23:51 GMT. He received an email from Twitter stating the suspension was an ""error"", but was not given any explanation as to why he was blocked. Online attacks and cyberwars have become a regular fixture in the military tensions between Russia, Ukraine and the US. Earlier this month, Anne Neuberger, US Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber, warned Nato allies to prepare for possible Russian cyberattacks on Ukraine and the West, weeks after a massive cyberattack took down over a dozen Ukrainian government websites. Officials in the US and Ukraine had previously stated that a new Russian invasion would likely happen alongside hacking and disinformation campaigns. President Joe Biden and President Vladimir Putin discussed cybersecurity at a meeting[https://www.intellinews.com/putin-and-biden-meet-in-geneva-for-constructive-talks-213407/?source=russia] in June 2021.

521,0,Greggs worker who filmed video of 'mountains' of food going to waste every day at the bakery chain was sacked when it became a massive TikTok hit,901 words,Mail Online,"* Ms Iwalowo's viral clip shows bagging up sandwiches doughnuts and yum yums * There were six bin bags full of food loaded up on a metal cage during the footage A Greggs worker has been sacked after filming 'mountains' of food going to waste every day. Nicole Iwalowo was fired from the branch in Romford, east London, after her footage went viral on TikTok. The 21-year-old said she felt 'awful' and 'guilty' seeing so much being chucked out after a month of working there. Her video shows bagging up leftover produce including freshly made sandwiches doughnuts and yum yums. There were six bin bags full of food loaded up on a metal cage during the clip shared on November 27. Ms Iwalowo said: 'There are people starving around the world and all of this is going to waste. 'Everyday we waste food like that [while working at Greggs]. We do 'good to go bags' but that's only like two bags and then everything else goes to waste. 'That day I just felt the need to record it because I felt really bad throwing away so much food. 'The sandwiches get made fresh everyday with fresh ingredients and that day we threw away [lots and lots of] sandwiches - it was about five bags full of baguettes, pasta and yum yums. 'With the bakery, on a regular day, we waste [lots more] items a day as well. 'The sandwiches weren't expiring there were just too many - it's the company policy that sandwiches are freshly made every day so they just have to get thrown away for some odd reason. 'They should give it to charity or or just hand it out to homeless people. There's a hostel near the store and lots of homeless people in the area. 'I just feel bad, I didn't even want to work there after that.' Ms Iwalowo added that she was sent home from work the next day and fired a few weeks later. But her post triggered thousands of angry comments and complaints to the bakery giant on social media. The bakery chain's official policy says it 'hates food waste' and 'donating unsold food to those in need is our priority'. This food is sent through partnerships with charities and sold at discounted prices through outlets shops and the app 'Too Good To Go'. But the statement admits that not every store it owns has these partnerships in place. It also states for stores where none of the partnerships have been put in place any unsold food is 'returned and transformed into renewable energy'. The popular chain claims that 'all unsold food is one hundred percent diverted from landfill'. But in the 20 to 24 hours a week Ms Iwalowo worked at the store for a month, she claimed she saw bags of freshly made, unsold food going to waste daily. She said: 'I asked them about it and they always have the same answer which is - 'you are aware that we do good to go bags' but that's only two bags. 'Maybe because they don't close on the shift they don't realise how much food is being wasted or maybe they're aware of it but just too scared to speak up. 'They said they donate some to charity but I've never seen a charity truck come to the store so what's to say that it's going to any of the other stores and other staff said they never saw a charity truck either. 'Staff aren't allowed to take any leftover food home, again just because of company policy. 'Apparently they used to let you take some home but people were selling it so now you have to pay for it or it goes in the bin.' Ms Iwalowo's video went viral and has been seen nearly 450,000 times and liked by 6,000 accounts. She said her manager immediately put her on probation and a month later was fired via a zoom meeting just before Christmas. She said: 'The next day at work they told me I couldn't work. 'They let me get dressed for my shift and everyone was staring at me and then the big manager told me to come into the meeting room and said ''you can't come into work until further notice''. 'On my video I wrote ''watch me get fired'' and they said ''you were being a bit petty about that so you knew what you were doing''. 'I thought it was a bit unfair, they could've given me a second chance and told me to delete the video.' A Greggs spokesman said: 'We have a number of initiatives in place to help reduce food waste across our shops including the redistribution of unsold food to community groups and charities. 'We are continually working to increase the amount of unsold food given away to those most in need and remain committed to putting an end to food waste.'"

804,1,Airbnb's 135% Rally Takes IPO Crown With Room to Run; BANKING/FINANCE,514 words,Broward Daily Business Review,"And investors have more reasons to stay bullish. Airbnb's stock is expected to climb by an average of 22% over the next 12 months with a majority of the 41 analysts covering the firm recommending investors hold on to their shares or buy more, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ""It is evolving, and becoming an interesting play with respect to work-from-home and long-term rental trends,"" said Thomas George, a portfolio manager at Grizzle Investment Management, which owns the stock. ""Those are additional levers it can unlock for growth."" Brokerages on average predict the company next month will report a 64% jump in first-quarter sales. Airbnb, which was profitable on a net-income basis the past two quarters, probably lost money again in the first three months of this year, analysts say. Its revenue grew 78% to $1.53 billion in the fourth quarter, beating analysts' projections as people spread out over thousands of towns and cities and stayed for weeks and months with workers no longer having to be in traditional offices five days a week. ""The benefits seen over the past year or so are expected to continue, especially as traveling increases with the pandemic hopefully continuing to wane,"" said Scott Kessler, an analyst at Third Bridge.  Airbnb's stock performance also has given it the title of best performer of any IPO to raise $1 billion or more since its debut, according Bloomberg data. This comes at a time where weak trading in recent IPOs has weighed on the listings pipeline. At $105 billion in market value, it's now the biggest online travel company, eclipsing Booking Holdings Inc., Expedia Group Inc. and Marriott International Inc. Some caution is warranted. Its stock rally has surpassed its peers by a mile in the travel industry since it went public, which could mean its upside is minimal. Booking has climbed 5.5%, Marriott is 29% higher and Expedia is up 44% in that time period. And it isn't cheap. Airbnb sells for about 12 times its estimated sales. That's well above its peers with Booking sitting at 5.3, and both Expedia's and TripAdvisor's are below 3. To be sure, shares of Airbnb more than doubled in value in its blockbuster debut and seen a more moderate growth rate since. The company has, however, fared better than other growth stocks as the market navigated through multiple tech sell-offs."

State Minister for Planning Shamsul Alam called the strategy to shift the extra subsidy to the next financial year as a most appropriate one at the present moment in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war. More than 70 per cent of the current financial year's projected subsidy, worth Tk 28,500 crore, has already been disbursed in the first seven months of the year, leaving the Finance Division in a quandary to keep the overall subsidy within the projection. Shamsul Alam said that the government would keep providing subsidy in the current financial year and try to adjust the extra amount in the next financial year."

Mira, too, kept the styling minimal for her birthday-bash look. She left her locks open in a side parting, and her glam picks included nude pink lip shade, winged eyeliner, dewy base make-up, and a hint of mascara. A pair of gold hoop earrings completed the accessories. Who do you think wore the ensemble better? Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times."
341,1,"Heard on the Street: Wall Street Trades Up, At Least for Now -- WSJ",787 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"It also suggests that volatility around Russia's invasion of Ukraine, tightening by the Federal Reserve and other factors are driving investors to make market moves, rather than just stepping away entirely. Much of the talk around big banks in recent years has focused on diversification toward steady fee-earning businesses such as wealth management and payments. That is because for years, the variability of Wall Street earnings has weighed on banks' share valuations. Investors are conditioned to question and fear whether trading revenues are sustainable, and whether bouts of volatility can lead to prints of big losses. This uncertainty leads many analysts to assign a lower price-to-earnings multiples to bank earnings, and to build in some discount on their book values. But count this as another quarter that suggests that the evolution of the business after the global financial crisis and the Volcker rule might have changed the game a bit. And the first quarter, in particular, might have shown that commodity volatility could, on balance, be an opportunity for trading desks. Banks still don't often give many details on the commodities component of fixed-income, currency and commodities trading, known as FICC. But Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said on a Thursday call with reporters that its commodities revenues more than doubled in the first quarter from a year ago. Goldman Sachs called out ""significantly higher net revenues in currencies and commodities."" Morgan Stanley described commodities revenues as ""notably higher than the previous first quarter, benefiting from the heightened levels of activity."" Though Russia's invasion of Ukraine presented some extraordinary events in commodities markets, banks' role in ""helping clients manage volatility in energy and carbon prices"" could create a lasting revenue opportunity, according to a recently published yearly research report by analysts at Morgan Stanley and consultants at Oliver Wyman. The report notes that banks' commodities trading revenues rose from about $6 billion in 2019 to $12 billion in 2020 and 2021. The report argues that this upswing can run for at least another year or two, representing a meaningful increase from the 2019 baseline. Likewise, the authors expect that changing monetary policies globally could spur industry revenue growth in what is known as ""macro"" trading, like around rates and currencies, at times over the next couple of years. The challenge in the future is whether banks can lean into trading opportunities without committing vastly more of their capital resources or putting significantly more of their balance sheet at risk. With Goldman the exception, the other global Wall Street banks reporting so far -- Citigroup, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley -- all saw their first-quarter ratios of risk-weighted assets to common equity Tier 1 capital, a key regulatory measure, decline from a year earlier. There were several drivers of this trend, but a meaningful factor was a rise in risk-weighted assets related to market volatility. With those capital ratios now in some cases edging closer to minimum requirements set by Washington, banks might have to start making some choices. If bank stocks don't fall too much, the returns on offer in trading might be attractive enough to justify shrinking buybacks to make more resources available for trading desks. Either that or trading desks will have keep finding ways to get more efficient with the capital they already have allocated. If bank stocks keep up the declines seen so far this year, perhaps buying back shares at cheap price-to-book ratios generates a better return. That could come at the expense of trading revenue, though it might be the right trade-off from shareholders' point of view. Wall Street trading action will always get lots of attention, but it isn't always the best use of banks' money.

457,0,"Five people shot, one fatally, at hotel in Northwest Washington",872 words,Washington Post.com,"""The pieces are starting to come together,"" Contee told reporters of the investigation, saying some people who had been in the hotel room know one another and were cooperating. He said the 3:30 a.m. shooting was confined to a single room and posed no threat to the public, adding, ""We are hopeful to bring this case to a closure very soon."" Police said a woman found gravely injured in the room died at a hospital. She was not immediately identified. Another woman was found wounded in the lobby, and a third woman was found elsewhere in the hotel. Two men who were shot went on their own to a hospital. Contee described the gathering in the hotel room as a party or social event and said the people who rented the room are from Maryland. Police said they were still working to determine what led to the shooting. Jamie L. Howser, the regional director of operations for Coakley Williams Hotel Management Co., which runs the Days Inn in the 4400 block of Connecticut Avenue NW, issued a brief statement offering prayers to the people involved and referring all questions to police. Reached by phone, Howser declined to address concerns raised by the community and by Contee about nuisance issues around the hotel, next to a dry cleaner that the police chief said he frequents. Contee said there had been 73 calls for police to the hotel's address since July, including 18 reporting disorderly conduct and others mentioning issues including drugs and loitering. The chief said he sees people gathered in front of the hotel, which he attributed to the bulk of complaints. There is no evidence that these concerns contributed to Thursday's shooting, but for residents who have raised concerns for more than a year, it was a realization of their worst fears. ""I sound a little frustrated,"" said David Cristeal, the chairman of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission for the area. ""We've had the walk. We've had the talk. We've had the community meetings. Now it's a tragedy ï¿½?somebody has died."" Cristeal said his group and others have repeatedly looked to officials for solutions, to no avail. Concerned residents held a community walk with police and city officials on the block two weeks ago, but Cristeal said that ""we never really got much information."" On Thursday evening, residents gathered outside the Days Inn, joined by Contee and D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser. They started by discussing the fatal shooting in the hotel above them ï¿½?beginning with a moment of silence for the life lost ï¿½?and then quickly launched into a more sweeping conversation about an uncharacteristic uptick in violent crime in their neighborhood. ""I think this size of this crowd reflects the fact that the community is extraordinarily concerned with the rise in crime,"" said D.C. Council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3), addressing a group of 30 or so people gathered around her. The crowd clapped and nodded in agreement when Cheh referred to a ""state of lawlessness in the community."" Several people asked city officials what more they could do to curtail drug use and carjackings in their neighborhood, among other crimes, and sought more information on their request to declare the Days Inn a nuisance. A representative from the D.C. attorney general's office, which handles nuisance complaints, said at the meeting that he could not comment on individual cases but that the office was looking into multiple properties. There have been over 278 calls to police over the past two years related to the Days Inn, according to 2nd District Cmdr. Duncan Bedlion, who joined the group Thursday evening. The most common calls were reports of disorderly behavior, he said. ""I want the community to know that I'm invested here,"" Contee told the group before he and Bowser walked up Connecticut Avenue, past crowded restaurants and a gym. Daniel Klimow, a 32-year-old attorney, joined them. He moved to the area from Arlington, Va., in November and showed up to understand more about what was happening in his new neighborhood. He said he left glad to see that so many people in his community ï¿½?from elected officials to law enforcement ï¿½?cared about their safety. But his views on his neighborhood did not change. ""I have never felt unsafe in this area,"" said Klimow, who has a 2-year-old and s 4-month-old. ""And I still don't."" Susan Svrluga, Kathy Orton and Magda Jean-Louis contributed to this report."

Days later, this Monday, the CEO again used Twitter to indicate that Musk had changed his mind and would not be joining the company's board. The decision came from Musk, the Twitter CEO explained in a letter sent to employees, which has since been made public. Musk informed the company of this decision on April 9, the same day he was to formally join the board.

21,0,Soufi's restaurant closes its doors permanently,547 words,The Toronto Star,"A family-run restaurant at Queen Street West and Bathurst Street, Soufi's opened its doors in 2017, bringing Syrian cuisine to Toronto. Its last day was Sunday. ""Our mom has been sick for a year and a half. We tried to make it through the pandemic but with the no-mask rule, it's too risky,"" said Alaa Alsoufi on Sunday. ""Plus, we're tired, we need to breathe a bit."" Mask mandates were dropped in most circumstances provincewide in late March, relieving some pressure on small businesses. But for the Alsoufi family, it made for a well-ordered exit. ""We were actually trying to reach this point, we wanted this to happen in the turning point, not when things were less certain. We were just trying to at least reach this point, it's been hard,"" Alaa said. Founded by the Alsoufi family, the Toronto eatery has been praised as a refugee resettlement program success story. After arriving in Canada, the Alsoufis noticed there wasn't much in terms of Syrian food throughout the city, prompting them to start their own restaurant. Missing from Toronto's kaleidoscopic cuisine were knafeh and maneesh. So the family decided to fill that gap, much to their customers' delight. ""This was a wonderful place, the food is delicious, the owners are lovely people,"" said Akash Swar, a customer who's patronized Soufi's since it first opened. ""It was really nice to have this community here and have the city get introduced to Syrian food. This is something I grew up eating back in Dubai, so its close to my heart."" ""I'm happy that they had that opportunity to share their culture and food with people here because I feel like Toronto is such a diverse city and it gives you that opportunity to explore your options and put something new out there."" Another customer, Josh Chernofsky, lamented the changing nature of Toronto's streets as businesses like Soufi's close. ""It seems Queen Street and a lot of streets in general are losing their character and it includes the loss of this,"" Chernofsky said. ""Nothing seems to be changing for the better in the city."" Although Soufi's is closing, Alaa points out there are other Syrian restaurants sprouting up in and around the GTA. ""There's a bunch of different places, mostly in Mississauga, and there is one on Yonge and Eglinton."" The restaurant has made headlines in the past. In 2019, Soufi's closed temporarily after their son was a target for death threats following a political protest. Now that Soufi's is closing on its own terms, Jala Alsoufi considers it a bittersweet moment. ""This is a project me and my family worked on really hard for five years, but now we want to focus a bit more on our family,"" Jala said. ""To take care of each other and we're really happy with what we've done. ""We're proud of this. We're proud of this space and we love our customers. It's just time for us to close."""

Analysts polled by FactSet had expected net profit of SEK4.07 billion on sales of SEK54.14 billion. The company earlier this week said it is suspending its business in Russia indefinitely in light of recent events in Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions imposed on Russia. Ericsson has around 600 employees in Russia spread across four locations in the country and all personnel have been placed on paid leave.  Ericsson said the quarter was also weighed by a certain SEK1 billion annual software contract that is normally recorded in the first quarter, but this year has been delayed into the second quarter. Higher research-and-development costs, the expiration of patent deals that are pending renewal, and investments in supply chain also had an effect, the company said. ""In light of the global supply chain challenges, we decided to create a buffer of vital components in order to secure that we meet customer delivery commitments,"" Chief Executive Borje Ekholm said.  Ericsson is facing scrutiny over previously disclosed corporate governance issues in Iraq, where an internal investigation found evidence of historical corruption, and the U.S. Department of Justice has stated that the company's handling of the matter breached a Deferred Prosecution Agreement. ""The resolution of these matters could result in a range of actions by the DOJ, and may likely include additional monetary payments, the magnitude of which cannot at this time be reliably estimated,"" Mr. Ekholm said.  Ericsson still targets a group earnings before interest and tax margin of 15%-18% within two to three years.

965,1,Business activity growth in south west hits ten-month high in March,784 words,Dorset Echo,"The headline NatWest South West Business Activity Index ï¿½?a seasonally adjusted index that measures the month-on-month change in the combined output of the regionâs manufacturing and service sectors ï¿½?rose from 59.6 in February to 64.3 in March, to signal the sharpest increase in output since May 2021. The upturn was the joint-strongest seen of all 12 monitored UK regions (on a par with Yorkshire & Humber). The seasonally adjusted New Business Index pointed to a further improvement in overall new orders received by south west private sector firms in March. Furthermore, the rate of growth quickened for the third month in a row to reach the strongest since May 2021. Greater intakes of new business were often linked by panellists to stronger customer demand as the impact of the pandemic continued to fade. There were also mentions of new client wins. In contrast, new order intakes rose at a softer pace across the UK as a whole, and one that was slower than that seen in the south west. South west private sector businesses generally expect output to expand over the next year, but overall optimism softened in March. Notably, the level of positive sentiment slipped to a near two-year low and was weaker than the UK-wide trend. While many firms anticipate that activity will continue to recover due to the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions, there were concerns over rising costs, supply chain disruption and labour shortages. Latest survey data pointed to a sharp and accelerated rise in staffing levels at south west private sector firms at the end of the first quarter. Furthermore, the rate of job creation was the steepest seen since August 2021. Anecdotal evidence indicated that firms expanded their workforce numbers to meet rising customer demand and due to efforts to fill vacancies. On a regional basis, only London registered a faster increase in employment than that seen in the south west. Although the level of work-in-hand (but not yet completed) continued to rise across south west private sector companies in March, the rate of increase slowed for the second successive month. Moreover, the pace of accumulation was the slowest seen since the current period of expansion began a year ago and only marginal. Higher backlogs were often linked to rising sales, but some firms mentioned that higher staff numbers had helped to alleviate some pressure on capacity. Outstanding business meanwhile increased modestly across the UK as a whole in March, with the rate of growth also easing since February. Average input costs faced by private sector firms in the south west increased for the twenty-second month in a row in March. Notably, the rate of inflation was the joint-second strongest in the series history (beaten only by November 2021). The upturn was not quite as sharp as that seen at the national level, however. Panel members indicated a widespread increase in expenses, with energy, fuel, labour, transport and raw materials mentioned in particular. Adjusted for seasonal factors, the Prices Charged Index pointed to a sustained rise in output charges set by south west private sector companies in March. Furthermore, the rate of inflation was the sharpest seen since the series began in November 1999. Where higher selling prices were reported, companies often linked this to the pass-through of additional costs to customers. A record rise in output prices was also seen at the national level, and one that was quicker than that seen in the south west. Paul Edwards, chair ofNatWest South West Regional Board, said:âBusiness activity across the south west surged at the quickest rate for 10 months in March as the impact of the pandemic continued to fade and customer demand strengthened further. ""Notably, the south west, along with Yorkshire & Humber, posted the sharpest rise in output of all 12 UK regions at the end of the first quarter. ""The recovery was accompanied by further steep increases in costs, however, which led to a record upturn in selling prices. Rising expenses, supply chain disruption and labour shortages weighed on business confidence, which fell to a 23-month low."""
422,1,"ALERT: Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc. Investors with Substantial Losses Have Opportunity to Lead Class Action Lawsuit - SDIG",862 words,PR Newswire,"If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Stronghold Digital Mining class action lawsuit, please provide your information by clicking here. You can also contact attorney J.C. Sanchez of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at jsanchez@rgrdlaw.com. Lead plaintiff motions for the Stronghold Digital Mining class action lawsuit must be filed with the court no later than June 13, 2022. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Stronghold Digital Mining is a crypto asset mining company focused on mining Bitcoin. In the IPO, Stronghold Digital Mining sold 7,690,400 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $19.00 per share. Stronghold Digital Mining received net proceeds of approximately $132.5 million from the IPO. The proceeds from the IPO were purportedly to be contributed to Stronghold LLC in exchange for Stronghold LLC Units, and Stronghold LLC would purportedly use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including for acquisitions of miners and power generating assets. The Stronghold Digital Mining class action lawsuit alleges that the IPO's Registration Statement was materially false and misleading and omitted to state that: (i) contracted suppliers, including Minerva Semiconductor Corp., were reasonably likely to miss anticipated delivery quantities and deadlines; (ii) due to strong demand and pre-sold supply of mining equipment in the industry, Stronghold Digital Mining would experience difficulties obtaining miners outside of confirmed purchase orders; (iii) as a result, there was a significant risk that Stronghold Digital Mining could not expand its mining capacity as expected; (iv) thus, Stronghold Digital Mining would likely experience significant losses; and (v) consequently, defendants' positive statements about Stronghold Digital Mining's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On March 29, 2022, Stronghold Digital Mining reported a net loss of $0.52 for the fourth quarter of 2021, below analyst estimates of $0.04 earnings per share, while Stronghold Digital Mining's Chief Executive Officer cited ""significant headwinds in our operations which have materially impacted recent financial performance."" On this news, Stronghold Digital Mining's stock price fell approximately 32%. By the commencement of the Stronghold Digital Mining class action lawsuit, Stronghold Digital Mining's stock has traded as low as $4.78 per share. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any purchaser of Stronghold Digital Mining Class A common stock pursuant and/or traceable to the Registration Statement issued in connection with the IPO to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Stronghold Digital Mining class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Stronghold Digital Mining class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Stronghold Digital Mining class action lawsuit. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery of the Stronghold Digital Mining class action lawsuit is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

385,1,Schools struggle to hire teachers,299 words,Irish Daily Star,"Principals who participated in the survey say the declining attractiveness of teaching is the main reason for this. A total of 84 per cent of principals experienced situations during this school year where no teacher applied for an advertised post and 55 per cent of principals state that they currently have unfilled vacancies. Principals claim inadequate numbers of teachers graduating in certain subjects, the high cost of the two-year Professional Master of Education and the decline in the attractiveness of teaching are to blame for the staff shortages. Pay President of the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland Eamon Dennehy said: âWe are seeing the fruits of a short-sighted government decision to devalue the work of teachers. Teaching is not attractive anymore largely due to demoralising unequal pay. âIreland is fortunate to have a high performing education system, but we are at a critical point. The Government must act now to end unequal pay and address recruitment and retention difficulties in schools. You cannot value education if you do not value teachers.ï¿½?Intense More than a third (34 per cent) of teachers rate their wellbeing as poor while more than a quarter (28 per cent), rate their wellbeing as good or very good. Teachers claim their workload and work intensity are the main factors impacting their wellbeing. Job satisfaction among teachers has dropped from 63 per cent in 2021 to 50 per cent in 2022. The right to disconnect from school e-communications after the school day was identified as the top priority for improving teacher wellbeing."

610,0,"Restrictions on gyms, dining could be extended, says Moore",507 words,The Toronto Star,"""I can't guarantee the 26th,"" Moore said of the January date for lifting restrictions set by Premier Doug Ford earlier this month. ""We need as a society to continue to protect the health-care system."" Ontario's top doctor also signalled that people with compromised immune systems, including those on chemotherapy and dialysis, will qualify for fourth vaccinations starting Friday, providing they are 84 days past their third dose. While the Omicron wave could peak early next week with the number of cases levelling off, Moore said at his weekly news conference that health officials need to see hospitalizations plateauing before the province can start easing restrictions. Even then, measures would be lifted gradually, in two-week stages to measure their impact - which means it will take time for some businesses to get back to full capacity. ""A sudden reopening, I'd be worried about another wave of Omicron,"" said Moore. It's not clear exactly when Omicron cases will level off, but when they do, it follows that a week or two later there will be peaks on hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions. The scientific director of the science table advising Ford and Moore said mobility of Ontarians is down, COVID-19 test positivity rates are down and hospital admission rates slowing, and those are all good signs. ""If we're a little bit lucky, we could start to see hospital occupancy plateauing next week,"" said Dr. Peter Juni, who stressed it is ""too early"" to ease restrictions on businesses while the province gauges the impact of reopening schools for in-class learning on Monday. The lack of widespread PCR testing to get accurate case counts makes this a ""challenging time"" to measure where the province stands, which is why health authorities are looking more closely at indications of COVID-19 levels in wastewater, he added. More modelling from the science table could be ready by the end of next week. Delays in reopening will further harm struggling businesses, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business said in calling for increased financial supports. ""This is deeply worrisome,"" president Dan Kelly said on Twitter. Ontario hit its seventh straight record of COVID-19 hospitalizations Thursday, with 3,630 patients, an increase of 182 from the previous day. There were 500 coronavirus patients in intensive care, a number that could double by the end of next week according to forecasts from the science table. Moore urged Ontarians who are eligible to get their booster shots, particularly those over 50, to help keep a lid on infection levels. ""What will take us off the rails is if we don't maintain the booster doses,"" he said."
975,1,"British Airways offers new cabin crew Â£1,000 bonus",355 words,Personnel Today,"BA is one of many airlines struggling with staff shortages following sweeping cuts at the height of the pandemic. The airline cut around 10,000 staff because of the restrictions placed on the travel industry. Many airlines have had to cancel flights because of a lack of staff, which has caused disruption as demand for flights picked up ahead of the Easter weekend.  BA has so far cancelled around 1,200 flights this year because of worker shortages and Covid-related absences. Some airlines say they are recruiting the staff they need, but delays in the vetting process by the Department for Transport have prevented many from being able to start work. This week, EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren said about 100 of the 1,100 crew it had recruited were still waiting for security clearance.

11,1,Late payments account for 69.7% of payments between companies,1100 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"In the case of smaller companies, default is a specter with which coexistence is normal, since due to their lack of structure they have less capacity to access financing and less liquidity than normal, and with the current context this type of problem is even more aggravated. It is in these cases, when small and medium-sized companies (as well as the self-employed) are stressed by the economic reality, they try to delay payment to their suppliers. The trend in late payments is a clear indicator of the health of the business fabric itself. In general terms, late payment can be understood as an adjustment practice in the company due to a significant lack of liquidity and that could put its survival at risk; or as the result of bad business practices. From the Spanish Confederation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (Cepyme), sources consulted by this media explain that, in the case of small companies, they do not share the last thesis nor do they believe that this is the case, and explain that small companies in Spain depend on suppliers and it does not make sense for them to risk losing a business partner. On the other hand, Cepyme points out that, in its studies on late payments, most of them occur among SMEs, with the exception of a small part, due to the fact that companies with greater structure and financial muscle have the power to make an agreement to delay their payments legally, something that SMEs will always accept because of their position. Delinquency in data Delinquency is not only an agent that generates a negative impact on the results of companies, but it is also a destabilizing element that generates a financial opportunity cost, because this delay in the payment of invoices and outstanding amounts substantially reduces the possibility of obtaining a return in the market, in the form of interest to creditors of commercial debt. Through the data of the latest Cepyme Late Payment Observatory, corresponding to the third and fourth quarter of 2021, we can extract the evolution and impact of the pandemic. The evolution of payments with the latest energy and supply problems derived from the war in Ukraine are not reflected in the report. In this sense, the data for the third quarter of 2021 show that the trade debt with delayed payment has grown by 17.3% year-on-year, reaching a value of 279,808 million euros. Thus, based on the legal interest rate of money set at 3% by the Bank of Spain, it has been estimated that late payment interest payable for late payment has reached 1,411 million euros (+15.8% year-on-year). Part of this rise can be explained by the increase in the percentage of total invoices with late payment, which has caused the commercial debt with late payment to grow at a faster rate than the commercial debt itself. Thus, the percentage of invoices issued with payment delays now represents 69.7% of total invoices. From Cepyme, its president, Gerardo Cuerva, explained to elEconomista that ""this decrease in liquidity has a direct impact on the company's productivity. It is a hole in the treasury, the company will have to resort to financing to make up for it and this costs it more than 1,400 million euros. The company is carrying serious after-effects of the pandemic, it has become over-indebted, with more bad debts, and moreover, the company's activity has not yet reached its pre-crisis level. Therefore, any impact on the liquidity of the company is very harmful to the health of the companies"", he clarified. For Cuerva, to all this must be added ""the rise in prices. The costs of companies are increasing, both in terms of energy and supplies, and this is endangering the supply chain of many companies. On the part of the smaller ones, many sectors have not yet passed on the costs to their final prices so as not to be expelled from the market, and all this increases the drop in liquidity in companies. For this reason, late payments are having a greater impact on companies at the present time. On the one hand, because the rising cost of products can in turn increase delinquency, and on the other because the tight profitability of businesses reduces their liquidity even further, leaving the company less able to absorb any arrears it may suffer,"" said the vice-president of the CEOE employers' association. Payment periods and company size We cannot talk about delinquency without dealing with average debt payment times. The differences between what is called PMP (Average Payment Period) in the report prepared by Cepyme, takes into account data from the last quarter of the year. The differences between the PMP of the different types of companies according to size have been reduced in the fourth quarter of 2021. On this occasion, it is the small and medium-sized companies that lead the drop in the PMP, with average delays standing at 82.1 and 82.2 days, respectively. Meanwhile, microenterprises have seen their PMP increase by 2.4 days year-on-year to reach a PMP of 78.4 days. However, although on average micro-companies take 4.6 days longer to pay than large companies, this difference has been reduced by 4.1 days in the last quarter. Large companies (with more than 250 workers) continue to have the lowest PMP, although it has grown by 5.3 days compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year, which continues to fuel the negative trend that has been observed since the beginning of 2018. The average now stands at 81.4 days. Download the latest Franchising, SMEs and Entrepreneurs magazine."

82,0,Burger King 's parent company to sell stake in Russian business,740 words,The Globe and Mail,"Toronto-based Restaurant Brands International Inc . released an open letter on Thursday detailing its plans for the Russian market, where Burger King has done business for 10 years. Recently, many of the world's biggest brands have suspended operations in Russia, including McDonald's Corp ., Starbucks Corp ., Coca-Cola Co ., PepsiCo Inc . and packaged-goods giant Unilever PLC . But those with franchise-operated businesses have discovered that shutting their doors there is not necessarily straightforward. In an interview with The Globe and Mail last week, David Bensadoun , chief executive officer of Montreal-based footwear retailer Aldo Group Inc ., said he was âfurious"" that the company's franchisee in Russia was keeping its stores open.  RBI has said in recent weeks that it was pulling corporate support for its Russian operations and redirecting any profits from that business to the United Nations' refugee agency . But on Thursday, the company said that it had not been successful in closing the restaurants. Even if RBI successfully sells its stake, under its current contract Burger King could continue to operate in Russia for the foreseeable future. âWe contacted the main operator of the business and demanded the suspension of Burger King restaurant operations in Russia. He has refused to do so,"" the president of RBI 's international business, David Shear , wrote in the open letter.  RBI operates more than 800 Burger Kings in Russia through three joint-venture partnerships ï¿½?a common business structure for the company's operations overseas ï¿½?in which RBI has a 15per-cent stake. All three of those partnerships are controlled by Alexander Kolobov, who handles the operations; Ukrainian investment firm Investment Capital Ukraine; and VTB Capital , an affiliate of Russia's second-largest bank, VTB . According to RBI , VTB also partners with other Western companies in Russia, including other fast-food chains. VTB is among the firms on which Canada and other countries have imposed sanctions. In the letter, Mr. Shear wrote that RBI is in compliance with all sanctions. âWe started the process to dispose our ownership stake in the business. While we would like to do this immediately, it is clear that it will take some time to do so based on the terms of our existing joint venture agreement,"" Mr. Shear wrote. He added that the company has faced questions about why it is unable to force Burger King restaurants to close. Mr. Shear wrote that the contracts for master franchise agreements and joint ventures that RBI has signed in Russia do not include legal clauses allowing a partner to change or overturn the agreement. âNo serious investor in any industry in the world would agree to a long-term business relationship with flimsy termination clauses. This is exactly why we say it's a complicated legal process when we are asked why we can't just unilaterally shut down the business,"" Mr. Shear wrote. âAny current attempt to enforce our contract would ultimately require the support of Russian authorities on the ground and we know that will not practically happen anytime soon."" He added that this also explains why other Western brands may continue to operate in Russia. Last week, Yum! Brands Inc . said it would close its 70 corporate-owned KFC locations in Russia, but did not specify whether more than 900 other franchised locations would also close; the company said it was working toward an agreement with its Russian franchisee to close its 50 Pizza Hut locations in the country. This week, the franchise operator in Russia for pizza chain Papa John's told The New York Times he would not close the 190 restaurants his company controls there.  RBI faces a similar issue, Mr. Shear wrote. âWould we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today? No,"" he wrote. âBut we want to be transparent with our actions and explain the steps we have taken to stand with the international business community in response to Russia's attack on Ukraine and its people."""

407,0,Do right by foreign workers to preserve Hong Kong's competitive advantage,1058 words,scmp.com,"In recent decades, Hong Kongâs competitive advantage has been built upon diverse foundations. Some are obvious and repeated ad nauseam ï¿½?low and simple tax rates, trusted legal system, unique access to the mainland and so on. But some are noticed less often and taken for granted until Covid-19 struck, such as our army of foreign domestic workers[https://www.scmp.com/topics/foreign-domestic-workers-hong-kong]. They make up more than 9 per cent of our workforce and provide support in at least 275,000 Hong Kong homes. Paid a pittance and often working long hours in claustrophobic circumstances, they make it possible for tens of thousands of Hong Kong mothers to pursue meaningful, well-paid careers, strengthening our local skills pool for the thousands of international companies based here. It has enabled Hong Kong to achieve a 54 per cent female workforce participation rate. That is behind Singapore, but on a par with Japan and well ahead of the global average of around 47 per cent. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge[https://www.scmp.com/knowledge], our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.

But Hong Kongâs strict âzero Covidï¿½?strategy has turned this formerly well-oiled system topsy-turvy. The ban on flights[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3163344/hong-kong-social-distancing-ban-evening-dine] from the Philippines ï¿½?the source of many of Hong Kongâs helpers ï¿½?has left thousands of helpers stuck in the Philippines. Whether they were back home on leave or waiting for flights to start new contracts, they are now stranded and will remain that way until flights are resumed. Even when flights start afresh, they face two weeks of quarantine. A shortage of quarantine hotel rooms[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3162809/hong-kong-provide-additional-150-quarantine-hotel] makes even this process uncertain. The disruption has left thousands of Hong Kong families without home help and has sparked a price war over helpers that are already here in Hong Kong. With a shortfall of an estimated 50,000 helpers, accusations of ï¿½?job-hopping[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3156503/hong-kong-domestic-workers-abusing-post-contract-grace] ï¿½?have flared. Anecdotal accounts report families offering monthly salaries of HK$6,000 (US$770) and more to poach helpers who are in normal times earning just HK$4,630 a month[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3150735/hong-kong-freezes-domestic-helper-wages-second-straight-year]. While the disruption in Hong Kong is severe and still unresolved, the disruption in the Philippines itself could be greater. That is because of the countryâs reliance on its bagong bayani, or heroes, as the countryâs army of overseas workers are called. According to the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, around 2.2 million Filipinos work overseas. Around 12 per cent of Filipino families rely on remittances from at least one bagong bayani. Remittances in 2019[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3043329/more-domestic-helpers-hong-kong-using-online-platforms-send] ï¿½?the last ânormalï¿½?year before Covid-19 struck ï¿½?amounted to about US$33.5 billion, equivalent to about 10 per cent of the countryâs GDP. At a time when unemployment inside the Philippines is 6.5 per cent, reliance on remittances in many areas is critical. This puts the Philippines among the leading countries that receive overseas worker remittances, behind India, China and Mexico. Because its economy is so much smaller than the leading three, its economic reliance on remittances[https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3084642/coronavirus-threatens-philippines-economic-lifeline-ofw] is without parallel. The economic turbulence arising from the global pandemic has sent alarms ringing through the corridors of power in Manila and through millions of families. Hong Kong thankfully appears to be an outlier, though, and remittances overall have remained more resilient than expected. Against predictions during the direst months in the middle of 2020 that remittances might fall by 13 per cent or more, figures from the Philippines central bank at the end of 2021 suggest a life-saving recovery since the nadir in 2020. They now predict a fall of just 0.8 per cent. Why is this? First, Hong Kong is an insignificant outlier. It accounts for just 7 per cent of all Filipino overseas workers, compared with more than 20 per cent working in Saudi Arabia, 13 per cent in the United Arab Emirates and almost 220,000 seafarers who staff the worldâs merchant ships and cruise ships. Also, because Hong Kongâs domestic workers are almost all young women from abroad, they are among the cityâs least-well-paid overseas workers. Those in the Middle East[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/2184893/saudi-arabia-encouraged-foreign-workers-leave-and-resulting] are more likely to be male and thus more likely to fill managerial or professional roles where pay is much better. Despite Covid-related upheavals in Saudi Arabia[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3108499/saudi-arabia-ease-curbs-migrant-workers-it-reforms] and the UAE, where there were reports of large numbers of early terminations of foreign workers in 2020, there appears to have been a strong recovery since then. Most significant of all has been a rise in remittances from the United States, where the large community of Filipino emigrants appears to have responded powerfully to calls for help from relatives back home. As a World Bank blog noted last November: âIt is remarkable to see the recovery in remittance flows in 2021, proving again their reliability as an absolute lifeline for families of migrants back home, especially in times of need.ï¿½?For now, families back in the Philippines have found some relief. Whether this can be sustained is another matter. Unemployment within the country remains high. Many of the stranded overseas workers can find no work at home and see no early prospect of returning to their jobs overseas or on cruise ships. The upheavals here in Hong Kong need to be resolved as speedily as possible, not just for the sake of thousands of families in the Philippines but for thousands of families here in Hong Kong. And there is that other, not-insignificant matter of maintaining an essential competitive advantage that has for decades been largely ignored.

972,1,"Together, for Change",1145 words,Beijing Review,"multinational pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, and Elizabeth Gaines, CEO of Australia-based mining firm Fortescue Metals Group (FMG), shared their companies' plans to expand business in China. They also applauded the BFA's success as a platform for regional cooperation. Edited excerpts of their views follow:  Leon Wang, Executive Vice President, International and China President of AstraZeneca  AstraZeneca entered China in 1993 and has since invested over $1 billion in production and operation along with an additional $1.5 billion in research and development (R&D) here. In Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, we have established a distribution center to export medicines to over 70 countries and regions. Today, China has developed into AstraZeneca's second largest market worldwide, following the U.S., and we are one of the best-performing foreign pharmaceutical companies in the Chinese market. China has achieved rapid economic development over the past 40-plus years of reform and opening up and has shown tremendous influence in the Asian region and on the international stage. The country's continuous optimization of its business environment and its policy reforms, as well as the emphasis on and encouragement of innovation, not only promotes the sustainable development of the economy, but also cultivates a supportive environment for sci-tech advancement, which boosts the confidence and determination of foreign-funded enterprises to put down deep roots in the Chinese market and execute long-term strategies. The Healthy China initiative, launched in 2015, promotes a healthy lifestyle as part of the endeavor to improve the people's wellbeing. China's strength in disease prevention and control, and in overall public health services, has increased in recent years.  AstraZeneca will continue to increase its input into China. Since 1993, we have introduced nearly 40 innovative medicines into China, targeting oncology and respiratory illnesses, as well as some rare diseases. Additionally, we inaugurated an upgraded R&D center in Shanghai in 2021 to develop new medicines from both China and overseas, and to further develop China's R&D capabilities within the global R&D network. At present, there are over 150 projects in AstraZeneca's China R&D pipeline, nearly 90 percent of the company's global total. It is expected that in the next five years, nearly 50 of AstraZeneca's new drugs and indications will be approved in China. In recent years, AstraZeneca has cooperated with local government organizations to build international life science innovation campuses, also known as iCampus. These platforms are serving as incubators for innovative healthcare solutions, and have attracted over 60 Chinese and overseas firms since 2019-when the first iCampus opened in Wuxi. The digitization of the medical industry is an important trend, and COVID-19 has accelerated the transformation. In the future, we will continue to expand cooperation and investment in this field. Additionally, AstraZeneca will work toward equalizing urban and rural access to public health services to help Chinese people achieve a high-quality living standard. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a global impact. However, the Chinese economy is already back on track due to well-targeted measures. This gives us enormous confidence and hope that COVID-19 containment is possible, and the international community can weather the public health crisis and continue to grow and prosper. As a powerful platform, the BFA continues to gather government representatives, industry leaders, experts and academics to conduct dialogues and promote innovation, and to play a greater role in bringing China, Asia and the world closer together. In the face of pandemic challenges, AstraZeneca believes we must join hands to create a healthier, stronger and more sustainable future for people around the world.  Elizabeth Gaines, CEO of FMG China's economic growth through urbanization, industrialization and modernization is driving significant infrastructure and property development, and underpins strong demand for steel and iron ore, with FMG providing 15 percent of the country's total iron ore imports. As a low-cost supplier of seaborne iron ore to China, FMG maintains strong relationships with all our Chinese stakeholders. We have shipped over 1.76 billion tons of iron ore to China since the first commercial shipment in 2008; signed contracts worth approximately AU$1.4 billion ($1.06 billion) with Chinese businesses since 2010; and introduced China's Hunan Valin Steel Group as our second largest shareholder. FMG has also initiated the China-Australia Senior Business Leaders Forum (SBLF), provided longstanding funding for scholarships at Central South University in the central Chinese city of Changsha, and joined the International Advisory Board of the Lingnan College, Sun Yat-sen University, in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. In January, FMG signed a memorandum of understanding with Sinosteel to complete a rapid project assessment of the latter's Midwest Magnetite Project, including a rail and port development at Oakajee in West Australia. We expanded our distribution channels into portside sales in China in 2019, with the establishment of a wholly owned sales entity: FMG Trading Shanghai. It has transacted over 35.3 million tons of iron ore since its inception. This portside sales capability to supply products directly to Chinese steel mills from regional ports is well established and has allowed us to enhance our service to small and medium-sized customers, complementing our existing contractual seaborne arrangements. FMG has commenced its transition to a green renewables and resources company that is underpinned by industry leading targets to be carbon neutral by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions in its entire value chain by 2040. Collaboration is integral to driving this transition and we are committed to engaging with our customers in China and elsewhere, our suppliers and other key industry participants to facilitate the reduction of emissions. This year marks FMG's 14th year supporting the BFA annual conference. The BFA provides a vital platform to further deepen Australia's business and political relationships with Asia. It is also an important opportunity to expand our engagement with China, which extends beyond the supply of iron ore to include important relationships across procurement, investment and finance, as well as academic and social linkages. We can discuss issues relevant to our region, including long-term opportunities for Australia's resources industry. This year's theme will encompass topics including the business sector's transition toward carbon neutrality and the global economic recovery from COVID-19. It will be significant to discuss how businesses and governments can work together to meet and exceed emission reduction targets. BR Copyedited by G.P. Wilson"
103,1,We hired celebrities as we are new to many markets: Kartikeya Bhandari,877 words,Mint,"It is a solutions brand. There is a product component and a service component to it. We connect homeowners with vendors and interior designers, and provide them with a platform to do an end-to-end job for home interiors and renovation. We are present online, but we also have experience centres in all the cities we operate in. We have about 4 million SKUs (stock keeping units) and 5,000-plus brands on the platform. It's huge, but there's still a lot of stuff that we do not have because it is such a long tail when it comes to this category. How difficult has it been to build a brand in this space? Before going into brand building, I think it is important to understand the category-a high-ticket value, unorganized, low frequency, and unstructured category, which means people are still largely reliant on traditional carpenters or contractors for a lot of stuff, thinking they have their best interests in mind which may not always be so. But you have no way of knowing as it's (the service) not standardized. When we came in, the first thing we did was to make sure people can understand this whole process better. We have made investments in the content site. We were not doing a lot of brand marketing. Part of the reason I came in three years ago was to try and figure out what the strategy would be. It was probably the right time for us to start building a brand that extends beyond the top, let's say, six cities of India, which was what it was at that point in time. Now, we are in close to 40 cities and also present in Singapore for more than two years. We have a strategic partnership with IKEA in Malaysia where we have started operations, and in Saudi Arabia where we will launch soon. Livspace ads have been quirky. Have they worked? We work with Tilt Brand Solutions and it's been a fruitful partnership. We started by understanding the consumer better. We realized that the attributes they look at before making a decision are quality and design. By quality, I mean quality of workmanship, materials used and fittings. By design, I mean both form and function as it should not only look good, but it should also do the job that it is intended to do. If you look at the previous campaign, we're just trying to establish that narrative. You have got Virat and Anushka because you have cash to burn or do they serve a purpose? I think they serve a purpose. The decision on using them was made way before we were in the unicorn club. We did this for two reasons. We are driving more expansion into tier-2, tier-3 markets rapidly. It's a new brand and people haven't really seen us or heard from us as we have never really used broadcast media in a lot of these geographies. A lot of them will be seeing us for the first time. That was one. Second, we wanted to create ads that is a bit more memorable, has more stickiness. I think celebrities have done that well. Last, we wanted to get celebrities who are representative of our core target group, who are known for their dependability and professionalism and are at the top of their game. That's the association we wanted to build. Is there enough demand from smaller cities? One of the good things about having a business which is digital is you kind of see where traffic is coming from. When I say small towns, it's really tier-two and tier-three towns...like Ahmedabad, Indore and Lucknow. And the reason for that is we are downstream from the real estate market, as in, wherever there is a real estate boom, and as and when people are buying homes, is where they will feel the need to get the interiors done. Which is why you have your usual suspects make up the top of the list for us as well as the top 15-20 markets that do a lot of business. The top 15 markets in India will be an addressable market of about $10 billion a year for old home renovation and new home interiors.

704,0,"Lacking oversight, Telegram thrives in Ukraine disinformation battle",785 words,Agence France Presse,"The fake Zelensky account reached 20,000 followers on Telegram before it was shut down, a remedial action that experts say is all too rare. For Oleksandra Tsekhanovska, head of the Hybrid Warfare Analytical Group at the Kyiv-based Ukraine Crisis Media Center, the effects are both near- and far-reaching. ""For Telegram, accountability has always been a problem, which is why it was so popular even before the full scale war with far-right extremists and terrorists from all over the world,"" she told AFP from her safe house outside the Ukrainian capital. Telegram boasts 500 million users, who share information individually and in groups in relative security. But Telegram's use as a one-way broadcast channel -- which followers can join but not reply to -- means content from inauthentic accounts can easily reach large, captive and eager audiences. False news often spreads via public groups, or chats, with potentially fatal effects. ""Someone posing as a Ukrainian citizen just joins the chat and starts spreading misinformation, or gathers data, like the location of shelters,"" Tsekhanovska said, noting how false messages have urged Ukrainians to turn off their phones at a specific time of night, citing cybersafety. Such instructions could actually endanger people -- citizens receive air strike warnings via smartphone alerts. In addition, Telegram's architecture limits the ability to slow the spread of false information: the lack of a central public feed, and the fact that comments are easily disabled in channels, reduce the space for public pushback. Although some channels have been removed, the curation process is considered opaque and insufficient by analysts. Emerson Brooking, a disinformation expert at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, said: ""Back in the Wild West period of content moderation, like 2014 or 2015, maybe they could have gotten away with it, but it stands in marked contrast with how other companies run themselves today."" WhatsApp, a rival messaging platform, introduced some measures to counter disinformation when Covid-19 was first sweeping the world. For example, WhatsApp restricted the number of times a user could forward something, and developed automated systems that detect and flag objectionable content. Unlike Silicon Valley giants such as Facebook and Twitter, which run very public anti-disinformation programs, Brooking said: ""Telegram is famously lax or absent in its content moderation policy."" As a result, the pandemic saw many newcomers to Telegram, including prominent anti-vaccine activists who used the app's hands-off approach to share false information on shots, a study from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue shows. Again, in contrast to Facebook, Google, and Twitter, Telegram's founder Pavel Durov runs his company in relative secrecy from Dubai. On February 27, however, he admitted from his Russian-language account that ""Telegram channels are increasingly becoming a source of unverified information related to Ukrainian events."" He said that since his platform does not have the capacity to check all channels, it may restrict some in Russia and Ukraine ""for the duration of the conflict,"" but then reversed course hours later after many users complained that Telegram was an important source of information. Oleksandra Matviichuk, a Kyiv-based lawyer and head of the Center for Civil Liberties, called Durov's position, ""very weak,"" and urged concrete improvements. ""He has to start being more proactive and to find a real solution to this situation, not stay in standby without interfering. It's a very irresponsible position from the owner of Telegram,"" she said. In the United States, Telegram's lower public profile has helped it mostly avoid high level scrutiny from Congress, but it has not gone unnoticed. Some people used the platform to organize ahead of the storming of the US Capitol in January 2021, and last month Senator Mark Warner sent a letter to Durov urging him to curb Russian information operations on Telegram. Asked about its stance on disinformation, Telegram spokesperson Remi Vaughn told AFP: ""As noted by our CEO, the sheer volume of information being shared on channels makes it extremely difficult to verify, so it's important that users double-check what they read."" But the Ukraine Crisis Media Center's Tsekhanovska points out that communications are often down in zones most affected by the war, making this sort of cross-referencing a luxury many cannot afford. lba/adm/wd/des/dva"

""We're hoping to be fully open in six weeks as we secure more staff,"" Mr Ryde said, adding that room rates were still holding steady, with lead-in rates for the Kimpton Margot Sydney currently sitting on $349 a night. In the next few years, IHG's rival Accor will debut its plush Mondrian, 25hours and So/ brands in Australia, having recently ushered in the Movenpick brand with hotels in Melbourne and Hobart. At the Marriott stable, Spanish-founded brand AC by Marriott opens next month in Melbourne, while The Tasman opened in Hobart in December, comprising Australia's first Marriott Luxury Collection hotel. (Marriott also has W Sydney and the Ritz-Carlton Melbourne in the pipeline, albeit the timings could be affected by the collapse of Probuild.) The latest figures from STR property data solutions show Sydney and Melbourne lag other capitals in terms of occupancy recovery, with their indices only at 50 per cent of 2019 levels. But the future looks bright. STR data shows that future hotel construction remains weighted to the nation's capital cities: 67 per cent of all hotel projects and 72 per cent of planned rooms are being built in the capitals. More than 35 per cent of those rooms will be in the luxury/upper upscale segment, says STR's Pacific regional manager, Matthew Burke, adding that luxury brands include the likes of W Hotel, InterContinental and the Ritz Carlton, while upper upscale brands takes in the Hilton, QT, MGallery by Sofitel, Pullman, Hotel Indigo and Westin. ""The biggest single growth category is from the 'upscale' class, with 29 per cent of all rooms to this one class,"" Mr Burke said. This category includes independent hotels and major brands like Courtyard, Voco, Quest and Novotel. Figures compiled by Deloitte and presented at Thursday's Destination Australia conference in Melbourne show Australians are now spending more on hotels at $182 a night on average, up from $167 in 2019. In the past week alone, local Marriott Bonvoy hotels - including its upscale brands such as W, Westin and Four Points Sheraton - have had a 32 per cent increase in overseas bookings. Sydney-based veteran Accor senior executive, now Tourism Australia chairman, Michael Issenberg, will address the question of which market segments are roaring back at the AFR Business Summit on Tuesday. ""As we pull out of the pandemic, the industry is watching for which segments are looking the best - leisure, business, luxury or the economy end,"" Mr Issenberg told The Australian Financial Review. ""Key to that is how many workers will return to our cities. Are people going to get back into the office on scale?""  Sarah Derry, the new CEO of Accor Pacific, confirmed Accor is also seeing strong growth in the top end of the market, and the brand has recently overhauled its Sofitel Adelaide hotel, and refreshed suites at Sofitel Melbourne."

Priyank Sukhija, CEO of First Fiddle that runs brands such as Lord of the Drinks, Cafe JLWA, Diablo, and The Flying Saucer said existing measures such as weekend curfews and being allowed to stay open till 10 pm anyway implied restaurants, pubs and bars would be as good as shut. Sukhija had previously told ET he had temporarily relieved 30% of his existing staff this month. ""We have been struggling for the last two years. It's high time they make up for this. Once things get better, the new excise policy that has been passed by the Delhi legislative assembly has to be implemented. They have taken the excise fee as per the new policy, which lowers the drinking age from 25 to 21 and allows bars to stay open till 3 am. We were promised this and should be given when cases go down. Currently, we don't have an option but to close,"" he said.Aseem Grover, owner of the popular Big Chill Cafe chain in the national capital said it seemed that the government was running out of ideas. Kabir Suri, president of the National Restaurant Association of India said with the new guidelines, it seems highly unlikely that restaurants can sustain their businesses any longer. ""Right from the onset of Covid, the restaurant sector has been one of the worst-hit. We were the first ones to be shut and almost the last ones to restart during the first and second lockdowns and I reckon that this third wave is going to be even worse than last year. We somehow survived so far, but with the new guidelines announced in Delhi it seems highly unlikely that we can sustain any longer,"" he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
747,0,Russia doesn't need to get stronger: all it needs to do is make us look weaker,1358 words,The Sunday Independent,"The Russian ambassador to Ireland, Yuriy Filatov, invited the fishermen to the embassy, and Russia duly announced they would relocate their naval drills. Filatov told an Oireachtas committee the decision was made ""on humanitarian grounds"" to avoid ""unnecessary hardship"" for Ireland's fishing industry. ""Irish fishermen stare down Putin's navy and won,"" proclaimed MSNBC. It was a heartwarming tale, from a more innocent age. And, as we now know, it was nonsense. For four weeks now, Russia has been failing to honour promises to establish humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to escape from the besieged city of Mariupol in Ukraine; they did not relocate a naval drill out of humanitarian concern for Irish fishermen, honourable though the intervention of those fishermen may have been. The Irish media and politicians fell hook, line and sinker for the yarn that Filatov spun. It took the former chief of staff of the Defence Forces, Mark Mellett, to point out what had actually happened. The incident was a classic example of ""hybrid tactics"", he said. ""What they [the Russians] did was give the impression that it was fishermen who sorted it, not the Government. And that portrays the Government as being weak,"" he told the Irish Times. ""That's what 'hybrid' is all about. Russia doesn't need to get stronger. All it needs to do is make the member states of the European Union look weaker."" This kind of ""hybrid"" activity exists in what is known as the ""Grey Zone"", which is interstate conflict below the level of war. Other hybrid elements include coercive diplomacy, propaganda, information operations, cyber attacks, military manoeuvres, and implied nuclear and other threats, as Cian Fitzgerald, a researcher at the Institute of International and European Affairs, explained in an article last week. The entire naval exercise may have been a hybrid exercise from the start, he suggested, with Russia's intention being to ""instrumentalise"" Ireland's security deficits and send ""a message to the EU and to Nato that Europe's western flank is vulnerable"". ""Kremlin homes in on EU's weak link,"" was the headline in the London Times. Mission achieved. On Wednesday, the director of Ireland's National Cyber Security Centre, Richard Browne, told an Oireachtas committee that the threat of a direct cyber attack against the State or state agencies was ""low"". This could change quickly, he noted. On Thursday, it appeared to be changing: the director of the UK's Intelligence, Cyber and Security Agency, Jeremy Fleming, said the agency had intelligence that ""Russia's cyber actors are looking for targets in the countries that oppose their actions"". Ireland has clearly identified itself as being among those countries; indeed, Ambassador Filatov told Russian state television last month that Ireland was ""hostile to Russia and everything Russian"". Stuart Madnick, a professor of internet technology at MIT, wrote recently that Ukraine had likely been used by Russia as ""a live testing ground for its next generation of cyber weapons"" and that, should cyber warfare break out, the US and EU could be targeted, given their support for Ukraine. Nuanced debate here about the nature of Irish neutrality is unlikely to be appreciated by a Russia that believes it is at war in all but name with the West as a whole. How vulnerable are we to cyber attack? The report on the Conti cyber attack on the HSE, commissioned by the HSE from the consultancy PwC, makes for grimly compelling reading. That attack cost ï¿½?00m to repair and, as with any severe disruption to acute care, must have cost lives. And, as PwC say, it could easily have been much worse: the attack was relatively straightforward, the attackers did not maximise the damage, and they provided the decryption key without the ransom being paid. PwC praise the staff of the HSE and hospitals for going ""above and beyond"" in their response to the attack; in every other respect, though, the report is a litany of failures. The HSE has a ""frail IT estate"". Its resources in critical IT functions are ""significantly lower than we would expect for an organisation of this size"". It did not conduct appropriate contingency planning for a cyber attack. It had just 15 staff in cyber security, who ""did not possess the expertise and experience"" required. PwC noted that the HSE's vulnerabilities were not unique to the HSE; it seems likely that many of them would be replicated across state agencies. Accordingly, in the UN's Global Cybersecurity Index for 2020, Ireland ranked 46th, between Tunisia and Nigeria, and ranked 28th in Europe. Ireland is a global tech hub. As the National Cyber Security Strategy notes, the country is home to more than 30pc of all EU data. It might seem ironic that the country would be under-resourced in public sector cyber security, but indeed it's entirely consistent with the history of the Irish State: the State's development model has, since its foundation, relied on subcontracting services to the private sector (including in that the churches and charities): education, health and increasingly, in the neoliberal model of recent decades, social and corporate services. Accordingly, there are more than 6,500 people employed in cyber security in Ireland, and just 30 of them are employed in the National Cyber Security Centre fewer than in many large companies, a cyber expert told me last week. (The NCSC aims to recruit 20 more this year and expand to 70 staff by 2024.) Pat Larkin, CEO of Ward Solutions, a cyber security business, himself a former Defence Forces officer, has described this model as Ireland subcontracting its protection to ""a cyber-militia of own-company resources and cyber provider companies"". The annual spend on cyber security by the Department of Communications (parent body of the NCSC) is ï¿½?.6m. Larkin believes it should be ï¿½?0m, benchmarked against our European neighbours. (The UK has committed to spending Â£2.6bn, equal to ï¿½?.1bn, on ""cyber and legacy IT"" over the next three years.) Ireland is ""nowhere near the levels of protection required for this decade and the rate at which the threats are developing"", he told the Oireachtas committee last week. Counterintuitively, the Defence Forces has no role here: its cyber security mandate is restricted to protecting its own networks. Even for that, its resources are inadequate, as the recent Commission on the Defence Forces found, with severe staffing shortages in the Communication and Information Services Corps. In an awkwardly worded but damning assessment, the commission noted: ""The actual specification of key capabilities for military cyber defence, and related counter hybrid warfare aspects is in fact low to negligible in extant policy statements despite the regular specification of cyber risks and hybrid threats"". One intriguing solution, which Mark Mellett described to me when I interviewed him in 2019, could be to create a cyber unit in the Army Reserve (along the lines of one in the US) which would recruit reservists from the wealth of private-sector cyber expertise here, rewarding them for their time and commitment with experience and challenges they would not get in the private sector. From courting fishermen to election interference to cyber, Russia has proven itself to be extraordinarily creative in the Grey Zone. Ireland will need not merely resources and resolve, but imagination and foresight, if we are not to be exposed again as a weak link in European security.

77,0,Burger King Russia partner 'refuses' to shut 800 shops,363 words,Bangkok Post,"It was not immediately clear how to reach Kolobov for comment. Shear's long letter highlights the many complications bedeviling some American fast-food brands as they try to halt operations in Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. It also exposes what can become a point of weakness in international franchising, which is how most American restaurant brands expand overseas: the relationships with their independent operators. On Mar 8, Starbucks Corp and a wave of other companies followed McDonald's Corp in saying they would suspend or limit operations in Russia. Like Burger King , Starbucks does not own or operate its more than 100 cafes there. But unlike Burger King , it had a willing partner -- Kuwait-based Alshaya Group -- that immediately agreed to shut its Starbucks ' locations in Russia and support its 2,000 employees.  Restaurant Brands entered Russia a decade ago through a joint venture partnership with three entities: Kolobov, who controls day-to-day operations, private equity and asset management firm Investment Capital Ukraine, and Russia's state-owned VTB Bank , which has been hit by Western sanctions.  Restaurant Brands has started the process to dispose of its 15% ownership stake in the joint venture. ""The company wants to do so immediately, but it will take 'some time' based on the terms of the agreement. ""There are no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement,"" Shear wrote. ""Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today?"" he wrote. ""No."""

The recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and the relaxation of the restrictions globally significantly impacted economies in the GCC region supporting the robust performance in earnings for FY-2021. Sectoral gainsMost of the sectors showed solid increase in net profits during the year. especially, the Utilities and Transportation Sector witnessed remarkable jump in net profits 2021 after suffering subpar performance during the pandemic. Out of the 21 sectors, 4 sectors witnessed y-o-y decline in profits whereas the rest reported growth. At the exchange level, Oman was the only market which reported a decline in aggregate net profits for listed companies during FY-2021 with a fall of 3.7%. In terms of sectors, profitability for the GCC banking sector reached one of the highest yearly levels during 2021, increasing by 52.9% to reach $35.4 billion. Banking sector profits reached the highest mark since 2018. The y-o-y increase in 2021 was broad-based across the GCC with profits for Kuwaiti banks almost doubled to $2.9 billion. Saudi and UAE-listed banks also reported healthy profit growth of 59.5% and 67.2% during the year. Higher profits also pushed the aggregate return on equity for the sector to a 7-quarter high level of 10.4% at the end of 2021 as compared to 9.6% in Q3-2021 and 8.1% at the end of 2020. The banking sector represented 18% of the total aggregate profits during 2021. Bahrain-listed companiesTotal net profits for Bahrain-listed companies increased by 225.9% in FY-2021 to $2.8 billion as compared to $870.2 million in FY-2020. All the largest five sectors by market cap registered a growth in earnings during the 2021 financial year. The Banking sector led the way in terms of aggregate FY-2021 net profits. FY-2021 net profits in the Banking Sector jumped 102.9% to reach $1.23 billion up from $609 million in FY-2020. Ahli United Bank posted the largest FY-2021 net profits among the banks with $607 million up from $452.2 million in FY-2020.  AUB reported its growth was mainly supported by effective balance sheet management and overall economic improvement in Bahrain and the GCC region. Arab Banking Corp was another major contributor to the overall increase in aggregate FY-2021 net profits. ABC reported $100 million in FY-2021 net profit returning from a net loss of $89 million during FY-2020. The bank attributed its turnaround to an increase in operating income as well moving on from the impact of ECL charges and regional fraud cases which contributed to its FY-2020 net loss. The Materials Sector, which has Aluminium Bahrain as a sole constituent reported the second largest FY-2021 net profits in the Bahrain Bourse. Alba, the worldâs biggest aluminium smelter outside China, posted a record FY-2021 net profit of $1.2 billion on the back of increasing aluminium prices and higher production. In terms of quarterly performance, Q4-2021 total net profits for Bahraini listed companies soared by 584% to $906.4 million up from $132.5 million in Q4-2020 reflecting the steep full-year performance. Only one out of the 13 sectors in the bourse registered a loss in the Q4-2021. Aluminium Bahrain, the Materials Sector, contributed the largest Q4-2021 net profits posting $480.5 million up from $84.9 million in Q4-2020. The Banking and Telecom Sectors followed reporting aggregate Q4-2021 profits of $316.8 million and $36.8 million respectively.

Saudi Arabian companies reported the biggest absolute increase in earnings that rose by $19.9 billion or 102.9 % y-o-y to reach $39.1 billion during Q4-2021. Excluding the quarterly net profit of Saudi Aramco that increased by 125.5% y-o-y, aggregate profits for Saudi Arabia declined at a much smaller pace of 46.3% y-o-y.  Absolute net profitsKuwaiti listed companies reported the second largest yearly absolute net profit increases after Saudi Arabian companies registering $7.8 billion increase in FY-21 net profits followed by Abu Dhabi which reported $7.6 billion growth in absolute net profits during the same period. The Energy sector reported the biggest absolute profits in the GCC that reached $31.6 billion, more than double y-o-y and 125.4% q-o-q. Profits for Saudi Aramco was up 125.5% y-o-y during Q4-2021 at $31.1 billion, whereas the rest of the companies in the sector reported profits of $539.2 million in Q4 -2021 as compared to a loss of $246.9 million in Q4-2020. Profits for Aramco were supported by higher crude oil prices led by recovery in oil demand globally coupled uncertainty caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In terms of segments, results also got a boost from improved refining and chemicals margins during the quarter. Sectors peers like Dana Gas and Al Rabigh Refining disclosed soaring profits which reached $38 million and $119.7 million respectively during the quarter. The banking sectorThe Banking sector also reported higher profits during Q4-2021 that reached $8.7 billion, an increase of 76.6% y-o-y but witnessed a decline of 10.1% q-o-q.

They're the enemy of the people,' Phillip's told Tucker Carlson  * Meanwhile, Stelter dismissed the college student's question while citing a 'right-wing narrative' at one point A University of Chicago student who called out CNN analyst Brian Stelter on disinformation in viral back-and-forth during a forum is speaking out about the now-viral back-and-forth. Christopher Phillips told Fox News' Tucker Carlson about how he had asked the left-wing pundit about his ongoing criticisms of Fox News. The freshman added that he called out CNN for spreading disinformation about the Trump-Russia probe, Nicholas Sandmann, and 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett. At one point, Stelter brushed off the college student's question while referencing a 'right-wing narrative.' 'The way I've always been is to search for truth and ask questions to sift through the lies and find out what's really going on,' said Phillips, a writer for one of the school's student publications. Phillip's noted how he had encountered several 'legacy media employees' at the disinformation-themed forum, who had said they spent their careers accusing other news outlets and politicians of spreading the same disinformation they too are often guilty of. 'Brian Stelter talks for 30 minutes about how Fox News is this huge purveyor of disinformation. They're the enemy of the people,' Phillip's told Tucker Carlson. 'And then I come up and I say, Wait a second. Run that back.' 'Because actually CNN ï¿½?from what I've seen, at least -- is probably 10 times the purveyor of disinformation that you claim Fox News to be,' he added. 'And you know, he didn't really have a great answer for it.' Phillips told Fox News that he didn't believe Stelter would admit CNN is 'corrupt,' however he did expect some form of compromise from the pundit, like an acknowledgement of retractions the network has made for some stories that had proven be false. 'But there was no apology,' Phillips said. 'There was no remorse whatsoever. It's just, you know, I don't know what news network you're talking about. That's not mine when in reality, he said these things on CNN. It's all documented.'"

Qatar is hoping to attract more than one million visitors during the World Cup that takes place from November 21 to December 18 this year. In the first round of ticket sales earlier this year, FIFA, footballâs world governing body, said it had received 17 million applications, the results of which were announced through a lucky draw. âFans can book accommodation via the dedicated portal which will offer various options such as apartments, villas and cruise ships,ï¿½?Omar al-Jaber, Executive Director of Accommodation at the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC), the tournament host organisers, said at the launch of the portal on Wednesday, confirming that prices would start from $80. âThe two cruise ships will have more than 4,000 rooms. There will be fan villages at four different locations.

The organisers, in a statement sent to Al Jazeera earlier this year, said that âwith up to 130,000 rooms for the one million-plus fans expected over the course of the 28-day tournament, there are no concerns over a shortfall of accommodationï¿½? However, al-Jaber was unable to answer Al Jazeeraâs question on whether the SC was confident there would be enough accommodation for all those arriving in Qatar, instead pointing fans with valid tickets to visit the portal at the earliest to get the best prices and availability.

84,0,McDonald's trademarks in Russia are under threat as Putin aims to retaliate for U.S. sanctions,1060 words,Washington Post.com,"Last week, Vyacheslav Volodin , speaker of the lower house of Russia's parliament, the State Duma, bid good riddance to the American hamburger chain, which has become an essential part of Russian life over the past 30 years. Volodin suggested that Russian-branded restaurants should take over the abandoned Mickey D's locations as part of the government's threat to nationalize Western companies that have exited Russia since the start of the war with Ukraine. ""They announced they are closing. Well, okay, close. But tomorrow in those locations we should have not McDonald's, but Uncle Vanya's,"" Volodin said. The Uncle Vanya trademark filing offers few details other than its classification under restaurants, self-service restaurants, cafeterias and the like. The application was filed by Aleksander Vladimirovich Leonov, who, according to his LinkedIn profile, is the owner of IP Pro Law, a company that ""has well-established business relations with Russian and Eurasian Patent Offices."" The firm's offices are, incidentally, just a few blocks from a McDonald's in Moscow. The law firm, says Josh Gerben, founder of Gerben Intellectual Property, is likely representing someone else, perhaps a squatter who hopes to trademark the name, Uncle Vanya, and then sell it to a McDonald's wannabe in Russia. ""This is somebody that might have seen ï¿½?the member of Parliament make this speech where he talks about making McDonald's Uncle Vanya's, and he thinks, 'I've got a great idea. Let me file a trademark application for this,' "" Gerben told The Washington Post . ""This is the way squatters think: 'I'll sell it to someone.' "" The Uncle Vanya application wasn't the only one to try to muscle in on McDonald 's intellectual property in Russia, Gerben said. Another applicant wants to trademark the name McDonald's written in Cyrillic letters, while another is looking to trademark ""McDuck,"" which Gerben said is ""slang for McDonald's in Russia."" But neither of these applications included a logo, which may explain why the Uncle Vanya filing got so much media attention. The Uncle Vanya logo is supposed to be the Cyrillic letter ""B."" The English equivalent would be the letter ""V,"" as in an abbreviation for Vanya, a common name in Russia and the avuncular namesake of Anton Chekhov's 1897 play. But as Twitter commenters have pointed out, the ""designer"" of the Uncle Vanya logo looks to have done little more than take McDonald's Golden Arches, turn them on their side and affix a yellow bar to the base.  McDonald's did not respond to a request for comment. Russia has a history of ""copyright infringement, trademark counterfeiting,"" according to the International Trade Administration , an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce . The country remains on the administration's priority watch list. But those concerns have spiked in recent weeks, said Gerben. It started when Russia's Ministry of Economic Development threatened to suspend trademark and patent rights, according to TASS, the state news agency. Then in early March, Gerben said, the Russian government issued a decree that said any person or business in Russia that uses a patent owned by a company based in a country unfriendly to Russia will face no economic consequences. Some trademark and patent attorneys weren't too concerned, however, until recently when a Russian court ruled that anyone can use the trademarks for Peppa Pig, the British children's animated series, without punishment. The judge in the case reportedly cited ""unfriendly actions of the United States of America and affiliated foreign countries"" as part of the decision. ""That Peppa Pig decision turned a lot of heads because it really gave a signal that the courts have probably been ordered to start to allow the piracy of, and the infringement of, IP owned by Western companies,"" Gerben told The Post. This is an unprecedented period for many U.S. companies. It's the first time in many decades that the United States is battling ï¿½?with, at the moment, sanctions, weapons and rhetoric ï¿½?a country in which many American companies do business. One way that President Vladimir Putin can fight back against the crippling economic sanctions is to seize the assets of businesses hostile to Russia, including their intellectual property such as logos and slogans, Gerben said. Putin has already said he considers the sanctions a ""declaration of war."" ""If you're Putin and you want to make a point, you will just turn these McDonald 's into something that's a little bit more Russian and you will operate them,"" the attorney said. ""You will find someone to operate them."" There is precedent for seizing foreign assets during wartime. The U.S. government established offices that seized control of ""enemy-owned property in the United States"" during World War I and World War II. It included property owned by German and Japanese companies. ""We're at an economic war at the very least,"" Gerben said. The seizure of property, including trademarks, ""is a tactic that has been used before,"" he added. ""This is definitely going to be an issue"" in Russia. In the future, if the war continues, the McDonald 's locations in Russia could be seized and operated under a new name. But that name might not necessarily be Uncle Vanya. It could be McDuck, McDonald's, spelled in Cyrillic letters, or something else altogether. Olga Massov contributed to this report.

558,0,"Japan set to put Tokyo, 12 other areas under COVID quasi-emergency",418 words,Kyodo News,"Japanese authorities worry that a spike in severe cases will overwhelm hospitals if the surge continues at its current pace and affects more elderly people and those with underlying conditions. Another concern is a shortage of essential workers such as medical staff due to a sharp rise in those designated as close contacts of people who test positive for COVID-19. Japan's daily count of coronavirus cases topped 30,000 for the first time on Tuesday, posing a challenge to Kishida, who has made the COVID-19 response a top priority since taking office in October. Three prefectures have already been under a quasi-emergency since early January and the planned addition of the 13 will mean about a third of the nation's 47 prefectures are subject to stricter curbs. Along with Tokyo, the targeted prefectures include its neighbors Chiba, Saitama and Kanagawa in the metropolitan area, which saw a stronger state of emergency lifted about three months ago. Aichi, Gifu and Mie in central Japan, along with Nagasaki, Kumamoto and Miyazaki in the country's southwest, are also asking the central government to impose a quasi-emergency, as are Niigata, Gunma and Kagawa. Kishida's government faces the difficult task of striking a balance between imposing anti-virus measures and keeping the economy going, especially as health experts say many patients show no or mild symptoms despite Omicron's highly transmissible nature.

950,0,"Delhi Covid surge: Eateries, bars to be closed, pvt offices to shift to WFH",778 words,Hindustan Times,"The exempted category of private offices includes banks, insurance, mediclaim, and pharmaceutical firms, etc. The DDMA warned of action including under the Disaster Management Act and fines in case anyone is found violating the order. It asked authorities to ensure compliance with the order. The order came as the positivity rate in Delhi touched the 25% mark on Monday, up from 23.5% the previous day. The rate is the highest since May 6 when 26.3% of all samples returned positive. Delhi added 19,166 cases on Monday, around 3,500 fewer than the Sunday count of 22,751. This drop was likely due to lower testing usually on Sundays and public holidays. The hospitalisation rate remains low. Despite more than 65,000 active Covid-19 cases in the city, fewer than 2,000 hospital beds were occupied on Monday. Over 14,000 people recovered from the disease on Sunday. The DDMA order noted Covid-19 cases, including those of Omicron variant, were rapidly increasing. ""Therefore, it has been felt necessary that some more additional restrictions are required to be imposed in Delhi to contain the spread...."" The decision is part of stricter measures planned to check spike in cases even as the government has decided against imposing a lockdown. The move is expected to be disruptive with traders and the hospitality industry saying there will be significant economic losses and the wages and employment of people in the sector will suffer. Medical experts said the curbs may be disproportionate to the threat driven by the Omicron variant which is manifesting in a less virulent manner. An official said the decision to increase curbs was taken after a jump was recorded in the number of deaths. The city recorded 17 deaths on Sunday and Monday, the highest since June 16. An interim analysis of the fatalities showed that over 75% of the 46 deaths that took place between January 5 and 9 were of unvaccinated people. At least 21 of the fatalities had an incidental Covid-19 positive test since they were likely admitted due to other illnesses, which may or may not have been made worse by the viral disease. Kabir Suri, president, the National Restaurants Association of India, said the sector has been one of the worst-hit. ""We were the first ones to be shut and almost the last ones to restart during the first and second lockdowns and I reckon that this third wave is going to be even worse than last year. We somehow survived so far, but with the new guidelines announced... in Delhi it seems highly unlikely that we can sustain any longer,"" he said in a statement. ""We are also very worried about the fate of 301,715 people employed in Delhi restaurants. We don't want them to suffer but unfortunately, we don't have adequate resources to support them for long.""  Confederation of All India Traders general secretary Praveen Khandelwal said instead of imposing a ban, it will be more appropriate to enforce Covid protection protocols at restaurants. ""The restaurant owners should be responsible for implementing such protocols in restaurants."" He added the ban could leave thousands jobless. An official defended the move, saying restaurants were a risk since people needed to remove their masks to eat or drink. ""It is well known that crowding in closed spaces accelerates the transmission of coronavirus. It was unanimously felt that such places may turn into super-spreaders even after 50% seating capacity cap already in place and thus it was decided to close the restaurants and bars,"" the official said, asking not to be named. Jugal Kishore, head, the department of community medicine, Safdarjung Hospital, said drastic restrictions would not bring any further benefits. ""The poor working on daily wages and in restaurants would be greatly affected by closing down. Health services also get affected due to curfew, which may have an effect on overall health conditions of the people."" Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times."

795,0,China suspected in hack of journalists at News Corp,466 words,Cyprus Mail,"News Corp, which publishes the Wall Street Journal, said the breach was discovered in late January and affected emails and documents of what it described as a limited number of employees, including journalists. It said that cybersecurity firm Mandiant had contained the breach. David Wong, vice president of consulting at Mandiant, said the hackers were believed to have âa China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit Chinaâs interests.ï¿½?The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a letter seen by Reuters, company executives told their employees that âwe believe the activity affected a limited number of business email accounts and documents from News Corp headquarters, News Technology Services, Dow Jones, News UK, and New York Post.ï¿½?âOur preliminary analysis indicates that foreign government involvement may be associated with this activity, and that some data was taken,ï¿½?executives said. The company added that its other business units, including HarperCollins Publishers, Move, News Corp Australia, Foxtel, REA, and Storyful, were not targeted in the attack. News Corp shares were down 1.3% in morning trading. The Wall Street Journal, which reported the news first, competes with Reuters, the news division of Thomson Reuters Corp (TRI.TO), in supplying news to media outlets. Chinese hackers have repeatedly been blamed for hacks of journalists both in the United States and elsewhere. In 2013, for example, The New York Times reported a breach which it said had affected 53 personal computers belonging to its employees. The paper said that the timing of the intrusions corresponded with its investigation into the wealth accumulated by relatives of Wen Jiabao, Chinaâs then-prime minister. The report was the first in a series of contemporaneous disclosures about similar intrusions or attempted intrusions at other US media organizations, including Bloomberg, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal. Beijingâs hackers have been targeting Western journalists for years, said Mike McLellan, the director of intelligence at cybersecurity firm Secureworks, which has tracked China-linked spying on media organizations on-and-off over the past decade. He said journalists might have access to valuable sources of intelligence about Chinaâs adversaries or its domestic opponents. Even considered against Chinaâs reputation for aggressive cyberespionage against a range of targets ï¿½?from military secrets to intellectual property ï¿½?McLellan said media remained a favorite. âJournalists ï¿½?and the things theyâre working on ï¿½?are fairly high on their list of priorities,ï¿½?he said."
156,0,McDonald's didn't just close 850 restaurants in Russia. It froze a whole 30-year investment.,1524 words,Washington Post.com,"The relationship McDonald's has with its Russian customers is unusual: It is part hustler, part history professor, part corporate benefactor, part Stuart Smalley. ""Let's write to each other sincere wishes and congratulations for the coming year in the comments and go into 2022 with a great mood,"" reads a translated Instagram post from Dec. 30. Nearly two weeks after Russian troops invaded Ukraine, and after activists and investors pressed the company, McDonald's announced Tuesday that it would temporarily close 850 restaurants in Russia. In the announcement, Chris Kempczinski , chief executive of McDonald's , said, ""Our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine."" He also acknowledged the tight relationship that the chain has developed with Russians in the 32 years since the Golden Arches opened its first restaurant in 1990, when the country was still under Soviet control. ""In Russia, we employ 62,000 people who have poured their heart and soul into our McDonald's brand to serve their communities,"" Kempczinski said in an email to employees and franchisees. ""We work with hundreds of local, Russian suppliers and partners who produce the food for our menu and support our brand. And we serve millions of Russian customers each day who count on McDonald's . ""In the thirty-plus years that McDonald's has operated in Russia, we've become an essential part of the 850 communities in which we operate."" But McDonald's was also in a unique position to cut its ties, however temporarily. Unlike many fast-food chains whose international units are operated by franchisees, McDonald's owns 84 percent of its restaurants in Russia. As an industry expert told The Washington Post , McDonald's made a seismic corporate shift with its decision to place humanitarian concerns above shareholder profits. According to a corporate filing, McDonald's restaurants in Ukraine and Russian accounted for 9 percent of the company's 2021 revenue, because the chain owns so many of the outlets. The price of McDonald's shares has been steadily dropping since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24. But in making its decision, McDonald's also had to do something more than forgo profits: It had to sever ties with communities that it has served for decades ï¿½?and with supply chains that it had created, virtually out of thin air. In a matter of days, an unprovoked war wiped out, for an unknown period of time, what it took McDonald's more than 30 years to build. When the first McDonald's opened in 1990 on Moscow's Pushkin Square, a short walk from the Kremlin, the debut was seen for what it was: The free-market system poking its camel's nose under the Iron Curtain. Because of politics and endless red tape (one person later claimed that opening a single McDonald's in Russia required 200 signatures from local officials), it took George Cohon , president of McDonald's Restaurants of Canada, 14 years to launch the first fast-food joint in the former Soviet Union. He made sure to do it right. He built the largest McDonald's at that time ï¿½?a 23,680-square-foot restaurant, with 27 registers and seating for 700 customers on multiple levels. From the start, the McDonald's in Moscow accepted rubles, which made the fast-food interloper even more attractive to everyday Russians. ""A shrewd strategy that is expected to attract local customers, who have grown increasingly impatient at seeing quality products on sale for foreign currency only,"" a Time magazine reporter wrote in a February 1990 article. Wrote a New York Times reporter at the time: ""Usually Muscovites can merely salivate outside several richly stocked groceries and restaurants newly opened for Westerners, exclusive marts that want none of the internationally valueless rubles and so bear the sign: 'For hard currencies only.'"" Tens of thousands of people showed up on opening day, including politicians and celebrities, even though a meal (burger, fries and drink) cost about 5.5 rubles back then. ""The equivalent of half a day's wages for the average worker,"" the Moscow Times noted in a 30-year retrospective on the first McDonald's . Russians waited in long lines ï¿½?a routine quite familiar to them ï¿½?to get their first taste of a ""Big Mak."" The store sold ""34,000 burgers on its first day ï¿½?smashing the burger chain's previous first-day record of 9,100,"" the Moscow Times reported. But McDonald's did more than open restaurants in Russia. The company built an infrastructure to provide products and ingredients to the chain's growing number of storefronts. The move was both practical and necessary if McDonald's wanted to maintain its standards: For starters, the ruble was difficult to convert into foreign currency, so it made sense for McDonald's to invest its earned money inside the country. But Russia was also famous for shortages. So the company decided to build a plant outside Moscow to process beef, produce sauces and test for quality control.  McDonald's brought in agronomists to help Russian farmers grow nonnative potatoes. The company introduced bakers from Canada, the United States and Europe to develop baking systems for the chain. Executives flew in meat experts to help Russian ranchers raise their cattle. By 1999, between 75 and 80 percent of the company's raw materials ""were being sourced from more than 100 local producers in Russia,"" according to a 2010 report by the IBS Center for Management Research.  McDonald's , the report added, ""made significant contributions to the development of Russia's foodservice and processing industries, agriculture, and business practices."" But the chain also helped push Russian culture into the convenience era. It introduced not only McDonald's iconic foods to the country but also breakfast menus and even the drive-through. ""Initially, people bought the food from the drive-thru windows, then parked their cars around the store and went inside the restaurants to eat whatever they bought,"" according to the 2010 IBS report. As in every country where McDonald's opens restaurants, the chain didn't just shove its Western offerings down Russia's gullet. It worked to cater to local palates. In the late 1990s, when Russia's economy was hit with hyperinflation, McDonald's tried to attract customers by adding Russian dishes to the menu, including ""cabbage salads, burgers with pork patties, chicken and mushroom soups, all of which were sourced locally,"" according to a 2008 case study.  McDonald's also introduced items apparently not available in stores outside Russia, including bone-in chicken wings, McShrimp and even a McWrap wannabe stuffed with those fried shrimp. But even the regular menu items seemed to be a cut above the same versions elsewhere: In 2019, a reporter with Business Insider ordered a Big Mac from the original McDonald's that opened in Moscow and compared it to one available in New York City. ""The Russian Big Mac seemed to have the same ingredients as its American counterpart ï¿½?two beef patties, American cheese, lettuce, onions, pickles, and the signature Big Mac sauce ï¿½?but it just tasted better,"" Katie Warren wrote. Given this history, it should come as no surprise that Russians flocked to McDonald's in the hours before the company pulled the plug on the 850 restaurants. As they did in 1990 with the first location, Russians again were standing in long lines for a taste of a Big Mak. This time, they were even waiting in their cars at the drive-through. On Wednesday, many hours after Kempczinski had already made his announcement, the Instagram account for McDonald's Russia finally posted the news. ""Dear friends!"" the translated post begins. ""It's very difficult for us to report this news, but due to the current situation, McDonald's has to temporarily suspend all businesses in our network."" The company, careful to maintain the relationships it has developed, made a point to say it will continue to pay its Russian employees through this period.

728,0,TikTok censorship of Ukraine invasion is alarming new development in Russia's information war,831 words,bne IntelliNews,"TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance Ltd, remains accessible but has been remodelled to push Kremlin propaganda to its Russian users after the implementation of the âfake-newsï¿½?law on March 7. A report by the European non-profit Tracking Exposed [https://tracking.exposed/pdf/tiktok-russia-15march2022.pdf]discovered that TikTok had censored 95% of content to its Russian audience, blocking the majority of non-Russian content. âAll European and American accountsï¿½?videos are not available in Russia, including institutional accounts such as the WHO and the UN,ï¿½?the report states. âEven TikTokâs own accounts on TikTok are not available, except the one for Russia.ï¿½?Non-political content was also targeted, such as the accounts of TikToker Charli D'Amelio and the actor Will Smith. A Russian user may find these accounts, but none of DâAmelioâs or Smithâs content is available to watch. Will Smith's TikTok account as seen from a location outside Russia Will Smith's TikTok account as seen in Russia In a social media first, Tracking Exposed noted that âcontent restriction is happening at the application layer rather than the transport layer, which requires the direct involvement of TikTokï¿½? This means that it is TikTok and ByteDance censoring the content, not the Russian state. As such, Russian TikTok users are now isolated in a âsplinternetï¿½? a term that describes the fragmentation of the internet network as a result of censorship. According to Tracking Exposed, âTikTok is isolating Russian users from the rest of the world, leaving them exposed to only pro-war Russian propagandaï¿½? Therefore accounts of foreign news outlets like the BBC are blocked, but Kremlin-funded accounts, like RT, that peddle Moscowâs rhetoric remain active. The organisation could not find any example of anti-war posts on Russian TikTok, but pro-Putin/Russia content was plentiful, as well as posts favourable towards Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko. Moreover, an investigation by Vice[https://www.vice.com/en/article/epxken/russian-tiktok-influencers-paid-propaganda] published on March 11 âuncovered a co-ordinated campaign to pay Russian TikTok influencers to post videos pushing pro-Kremlin narrativesï¿½? A point worth noting is that the search term âZelenskiyï¿½?is not banned, but the search results show content that is derogatory towards the Ukrainian leader, often featuring homophobic slurs[https://www.tiktok.com/@nailiad/video/7070798181369498882]. Tracking Exposed concluded that TikTokâs censorship is âabove and beyondï¿½?the requirement of Russiaâs âfake-newsï¿½?law. Instead, the law has been used as an excuse to legitimise the censorship of any criticism of the Kremlinâs official narrative on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As to why TikTok would censor anti-Kremlin content, Tracking Exposed reason that this is due to China and Russiaâs partnership in the information war. Chinese social media platforms Weibo, WeChat and Douyin censored anti-war content shortly after Russiaâs full-scale attack on Ukraine. It is therefore likely that the Chinese Communist Party put pressure on ByteDance to restrict content in Russia. Moreover, by complying with Russiaâs ""fake-news"" law, ByteDance ensures a healthy business relationship with Russia, which is TikTokâs fourth-largest [https://datareportal.com/essential-tiktok-stats]market. What does this mean for the future of the Russian internet? âWith the blockage of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and now extensive content restriction on TikTok, the era of the free internet in Russia has endedï¿½? Tracking Beyond states. Instead, Russia will likely follow Chinaâs restrictive model, âwhere platforms are forced to abide by the government censorship guidelines in order to remain availableï¿½? The organisation even predicts that ByteDance could release a Russian-specific version of TikTok, similar to social media platforms in the Peopleâs Republic of China. Ultimately, TikTokâs decision is a new step in information warfare. It will further the Kremlinâs control over Russian citizens by completely cutting them off from foreign information, giving Moscow the opportunity to mould an alternative reality. As a result, we may see hackers, like the group Anonymous, continue their efforts to spread information about the invasion and the realities of Ukraine to Russian citizens. Earlier this month, Anonymous successfully hacked into Russian streaming services Wink and Ivi, and Russian state TV channels. Regular programmes were interrupted by graphic footage from the war in Ukraine, followed by a message condemning President Putin and the invasion. Tracking Beyond accuses TikTok of ânot being transparent about its policy actions in Russia,ï¿½?and calls on the company to âclarify its content policy in Russia and give data access for public scrutiny.ï¿½?TikTok has not commented on the findings in the report, nor has it announced the changes it made."

Key Performance Metrics and Non-IFRS Financial Measures (MORE TO FOLLOW)  PropertyGuru Beats Adjusted EBITDA Forecast in -2- Engagement Market Share is the average monthly engagement for websites owned by PropertyGuru as compared to average monthly engagement for a basket of peers calculated over the relevant period. Engagement is calculated as the number of visits to a website during a period multiplied by the total amount of time spent on that website for the same period, in each case based on data from SimilarWeb. Engagement Market Share is based on the prevailing SimilarWeb algorithm on the date the Company first filed or furnished such information to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). Number of agents in all Priority Markets except Vietnam is calculated for a period as the sum of the number of agents with a valid 12-month subscription package at the end of each month in a period divided by the number of months in such period. In Vietnam, number of agents is calculated as the number of agents who credit money into their account within the relevant period. When counting in aggregate across the PropertyGuru group, in markets where PropertyGuru operates more than one property portal, an agent with subscriptions to more than one portal is only counted once. Number of real estate listings is calculated as the number of listings created during the month for Vietnam and the average number of monthly listings available in the period for other markets. This document also includes references to non-IFRS financial measures, namely Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. PropertyGuru uses these measures, collectively, to evaluate ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. PropertyGuru believes that non-IFRS information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and may assist in comparisons with other companies to the extent that such other companies use similar non-IFRS measures to supplement their IFRS or GAAP results. These non-IFRS measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, and may be different from similarly titled non-IFRS measures used by other companies. Accordingly, non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of other IFRS financial measures, such as net loss and loss before income tax.

292,1,"Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses Exceeding $100,000 In Rivian To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options",895 words,ACCESSWIRE,"Image: https://www.accesswire.com/users/newswire/images/697655/image.pngThere [https://www.accesswire.com/users/newswire/images/697655/image.pngThere] is no cost or obligation to you. Image: https://www.accesswire.com/users/newswire/images/697655/image-1.pngFaruqi [https://www.accesswire.com/users/newswire/images/697655/image-1.pngFaruqi] & Faruqi is a leading minority and Woman-owned national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. As detailed below, the lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) Rivian would not meet its 2021 production and delivery targets; (2) Rivian's vehicles were underpriced and the Company would need to substantially increase prices; and (3) as a result, Defendants' representations about the Company's business, operations, and prospects lacked a reasonable basis.  Rivian is an electric vehicle company that in 2018 unveiled its first consumer EV's, the R1T electric pickup truck, and the R1S electric SUV. On November 10, 2021, Rivian offered 153 million shares to the public through an IPO at a price of $78.00 per share for total proceeds of $11.93 billion. According to the Registration Statement, the ""R1T and R1S introduce our brand to the world and will serve as our flagship vehicles as we continue to expand our offerings.""  Rivian's focus on its reputation for transparency and devotion to its customers, along with Rivian's R1T and R1S, including the large number of preorders and potential for increased demand were key selling points to IPO investors. Unbeknownst to investors, however, the Registration Statement's representations were materially inaccurate, misleading, and/or incomplete because they failed to disclose, among other things, that the R1T and R1S were underpriced to such a degree that Rivian would have to raise prices shortly after the IPO and that these price increases would tarnish Rivian's reputation as a trustworthy and transparent company and would put a significant number of the existing backlog of 55,400 preorders along with future preorders in jeopardy of cancellation. As a result, the price of the Company's shares was artificially and materially inflated at the time of the Offering. On March 1, 2022, Rivian announced that it was raising the prices of its R1T pickup and R1S SUV by 17 percent and 20 percent, respectively, and that the new prices would apply to nearly all preorders. At the time of the announcement, Rivian had only produced and sold roughly 1,000 vehicles. A March 2, 2022 article in the online publication ARS Technica, titled ""Rivian surprises, outrages EV truck buyers with 20% price hike,"" questioned the reasons behind the price increases. An article published in Electrek on March 2, 2022, titled ""Rivian buyers are cancelling at alarming rates after price increases,"" noted that: ""A poll on the Rivian subreddit, one of the biggest communities of Rivian fans, gives us a better idea of the pulse of the reservation holders, and it shows a high cancelation rate"" and provided a screenshot of the poll, which showed a majority of voters planned to cancel their reservations. By the commencement of the class action lawsuit, the price of Rivian shares closed at $42.43 per share, significantly below their $78.00 IPO Price. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.  Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rivian's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. Attorney Advertising.

617,1,60% increase in sales of jack mackerel and bonito during Easter week in Huancayo markets,347 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"A kilo of seafood is 12 and 13 soles, and each crab costs 2 soles. A dozen choros is 4 soles. A kilo of squid costs 8 soles. A kilo of shrimp costs up to 60 soles. ""My grandchildren like the bonito fish, and since it is comfortable I am going to take it for the 5 members of my family,"" said Isabel Cervantes. As during Holy Week, the tradition is to eat fish, the merchant RaÃºl Uribe, recommended families to opt for various preparations such as ceviche, fried fish, parihuela, chicharrÃ³n de pescado and sudado. In addition, the traditional chilcano is prepared with the fish head. To recognize fresh fish, it is necessary to check that the skin is brightly colored, the scales iridescent and shiny, and without any discoloration. Fresh fish has hard flesh and is not flaccid at all. Do not buy pieces whose skin is detached from the flesh. Make sure that the eyes protrude and the pupil is shiny black. Never buy fish with sunken eyes, gray pupil and milky cornea. The gills should have a deep red or pink color and a clean, shiny appearance. The fish should smell like the sea and if it is not fresh its gills should be yellowish or grayish in color."

Among them is Honest Company founder and chief creative officer Jessica Alba, also known for her acting roles in films like Fantastic Four and TV shows like Dark Angel.

Alba also took a $563,077 salary, and received a $1.4 million bonus. However, thanks to volatility in Honest Companyâs stock price (it closed Thursday at $4.52 per share, down from $23 per share the day it IPOâd), Albaâs stake in the company declined in value to just over $27 million, from about $130 million in the IPO.

424,1,"iWOW Technology ends Catalist debut at S$0.26, up 4% from IPO price",660 words,Business Times Singapore,"The counter opened at S$0.275 on Thursday (Apr 14), up 10 per cent or S$0.025 from its initial public offering (IPO) price of S$0.25. As at 9.05am, the counter was trading at S$0.28, up 12 per cent or S$0.03 from the IPO price. iWOW was also one of the most actively traded stocks on SGX in early trade, with some 2.3 million shares changing hands as at 9.08am. At 9.12am, the counter had pared some gains back to its open price of S$0.275, with some 2.4 million shares traded. iWOW shares eventually ended the day at S$0.26, with a total of 15 million shares traded over the course of the day. iWOW had on Apr 6 launched its IPO, looking to sell a total of 26 million shares to raise gross proceeds of about S$6.5 million. This placement constitutes about 10.4 per cent of iWOW's enlarged share capital of 250.4 million shares. The company will have a theoretical market capitalisation of S$62.6 million after the placement, and a price-to-earnings ratio of 16.9 times. As at the close of placement at noon on Apr 12, all 26 million placement shares were validly subscribed for, with indications of interest received for some 78 million shares, meaning that the IPO was about 3 times subscribed. The group is notably one of the manufacturers of TraceTogether tokens. The company and electronics distributor Siix Singapore formed a consortium in 2020, and won one of the tenders to design and manufacture subsequent batches of the tokens. Another tender went to electronics manufacturer PCI. iWOW's other products include smart-metering solutions to remotely monitor water and gas consumption, electronic monitoring devices for ex-offenders and accused persons, and alarm alert systems for the elderly. As at Mar 8, TraceTogether tokens accounted for 16.8 per cent or S$11.3 million of the group's S$67.4 million order book. Some S$54.2 million or 80.4 per cent of the order book comes from electronic monitoring systems. Smart-metering solutions constitute S$800,000, and alarm alert systems account for S$1.1 million. For FY2021 ended March, the group posted net profit of S$3.7 million - up from S$220,000 in FY2020, due largely to a spike in revenue to S$26.4 million from S$4.4 million in the year ago. TraceTogether tokens accounted for 81 per cent of FY2021's revenue. Some 19.2 per cent of the total IPO proceeds, or S$1.25 million, will be used to strengthen the group's research and development (R&D) capabilities to provide customisable IoT solutions; a further 15.4 per cent or S$1 million has been set aside to enlarge the company's customer base by engaging its existing B2B (business to business) customers and expanding offerings to the B2C (business to customers) segment. Another 7.7 per cent or S$500,000 of the IPO proceeds will be channelled into expanding the company's market reach into new countries such as Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the UAE. Other uses of IPO proceeds include investments and merger and acquisition activities, as well as working capital and listing expenses. Evolve Capital Advisory is the sponsor and issue manager of the IPO, while Futu Singapore is the underwriter and placement agent."

Speaking on RTÃ's News at One, Donnelly said it is about striking a balance between moving forward, yet remaining sensible. ""If advance warning could be given for people to plan, I think that would be fantastic, but I just donât want to raise hopes in an unhelpful way,"" he said when asked if capacity crowds will return after NPHETâs meeting on Thursday.

My name is Diana Lee, and I am Vice President, Diversity and Inclusion here at TD. Many of us are joining today's meeting from lands across North America, which is referred to by many indigenous peoples as Turtle Island. To begin our meeting today, I want to acknowledge that I am joining you from Toronto, which is the traditional territory of many nations, including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First Nations, Metis and Inuit peoples. I also acknowledge that Toronto was covered by Treaty 13 signed with the Mississaugas of the Credit, and the Williams Treaties signed with multiple Mississaugas and Chippewa bands. Land acknowledgment is one step towards recognizing and honoring the enduring presence, resilience and contribution of indigenous peoples and their traditional territories that we stand on today. I am grateful to have the opportunity to live and work on this land and encourage each of us to continue on our journey in support of reconciliation, including increasing our understanding of the history and ongoing stories of indigenous peoples. Thank you. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Brian Levitt, Chairman of the Board, TD Bank Group. Brian Levitt (foreign language)  BRIAN MICHAEL LEVITT, INDEPENDENT NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, THE TORONTO-DOMINION BANK: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the 2022 TD Bank Group Annual Meeting of Shareholders. To our Francophone shareholders, we wish you a warm welcome to our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. I'm Brian Levitt, Chair of the Board of Directors. I'll act as Chair of the meeting as stipulated by the Bank's bylaws. This meeting is called to order. With the consent of the meeting, I'll ask Norie Campbell, TD's General Counsel to serve as Secretary of the meeting. Before we move to the business of the meeting, I want to express to all Ukrainians around the world, our sincere hope that the war will come to an end as soon as possible. You're in our thoughts. We're delighted to be able to welcome some shareholders today in person, and we also welcome those of you joining us by webcast or through the phone line. As was done last year, we've enabled question-and-comment capabilities through our phone lines and webcast with the aim of making the virtual experience -- the experience for virtual attendees as interactive as possible. As in past years, both English and French will be spoken during this meeting. Simultaneous translation will be provided in person and over both our English and French webcast and phone lines. Additionally, shareholders and proxy holders will be able to ask questions in the room over the phone line or through the webcast. Let me explain how this will work. With the goal of allowing all our shareholders and proxy holders to participate regardless of whether they're here with us in person on the phone or on the webcast, we'll take questions from the room first, then from the phone and then through the webcast. In each case, we ask that you identify whether your question relates to a motion being considered as part of the formal business of this meeting or whether it's a little more general in nature. If you're in the room and would like to ask a question, you will be prompted to approach one of the microphones on the floor at the appropriate time. Those with limited mobility, please raise your hand and a microphone will be brought to you. We will address questions that directly relate to a particular motion at the appropriate time. And we ask that you save general questions for the question-and-answer period, which will follow the formal business. To ask a question over the phone, you'll be prompted to enter the question queue at the appropriate time. When we're ready to take your questions, the operator will introduce you. We'd like to -- we would like all of our shareholders that wish to ask a question to have the opportunity to do so. So we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time. If you have additional questions, please requeue at the microphone or on the telephone line to allow us to speak with as many shareholders as possible during the meeting. If you are on the webcast and have a question, click on the Ask a Question tab at the top right of the webcast page. Please read the instructions in the text box before submitting your question. Shareholders who wish to submit a question or comment through the webcast platform can do so at any time, and we will address them at the appropriate time. A TD representative will read out the questions received over the webcast. Questions will be read out in the language used by the submitting shareholder and if submitted in French and English translation will follow. If we have several questions that are very similar in nature, we'll read out one of the questions and mention that we've received similar questions. As in past years, the vast majority of our shareholders submitted their proxies or voting instructions in advance of the meeting, but shareholders and proxy holders, whether attending virtually or in person, will also have the opportunity to vote during the meeting. Here's how you can vote through our virtual voting platform. Once you're logged into the webcast, click the [Vote] tab at the top right of the webcast page and a separate browser window will open. Shareholders that are not logged into the webcast can access the virtual voting platform from the 2022 Annual Meeting page on TD's website. Once you've accessed the voting platform, you can register to vote by entering your control number as your user name and entering TD 2022, all upper case, as your password. Voting will be open so long as the formal portion of the meeting is proceeding. If you have voted in advance of the meeting and do not wish to change your vote, then you do not need to do anything. If you're with us in the room and you wish to vote during the meeting, you will need the yellow and blue ballots that were provided to you at the registration desk. I've received satisfactory proof that the Notice calling this meeting was duly publicized and sent to all shareholders of the bank. We received proxies representing more than 53% of the approximately 1.8 billion outstanding common shares. Accordingly, we have a quorum present, and I declare the meeting duly and properly constituted. As in past years, we will have a question-and-answer session after the formal business of the meeting is completed. As I noted earlier, during the formal portion of the meeting, we will pause to address questions and comments submitted by shareholders and proxy holders that are specific to the motions being considered. As always, we ask that any questions that you ask relate to the business or affairs of the bank and not be of a personal nature. For people in the room, we have a representative from TD Customer Care here with us today. Can I ask [Isabelle Hackman] to stand and be recognized. Isabelle there (inaudible). If your question is of a personal nature, we will defer your question and ask that you speak with Isabelle after the meeting or we will have one of our customer care representatives get in touch with you after the meeting. The agenda for today's meeting is available on the annual meeting page on TD's Investor Relations website and for in-person attendees, the agenda can be found in the booklet that was on your chair. Please note that discussions during the meeting may contain forward-looking statements about the Bank's outlook and objectives and strategies to achieve them. Bharat will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, also known as adjusted results in his remarks. Details regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures are on the slide presented in the room and on the webcast and can also be found in the Bank's financial reporting. Now I'd like to introduce the individuals who are with me on the podium today.

Pat Lee and Helen Kim, representatives of TSX Trust Company, the Bank's register and transfer agent will act as scrutineers. Before I invite Bharat to address the meeting, I'd like to take a minute to recognize the tremendous efforts of all our TD colleagues over the past year. They successfully navigated through the second year of the pandemic, serve customers with dedication and care and contributed to the success of the communities and economies that rely on TD. On behalf of the Board, I'd like to thank them for all that they have done.

Building on the communities, the commitments we've made through our climate action plan, TD will continue to lead in this space as we enable a more sustainable and inclusive future. I'd like to recognize the tremendous efforts of Bharat and his executive team who delivered for all stakeholders, including our shareholders.

With that, I'll ask Bharat to address the meeting. Thank you.  BHARAT B. MASRANI, GROUP PRESIDENT, CEO & DIRECTOR, THE TORONTO-DOMINION BANK: Thank you, Brian, and good morning. I want to welcome everyone on the phone and the webcast as well as those of you in the room in Toronto. I'm very pleased that we could hold an in-person meeting this morning. We've not met in person since April of 2019 to discuss our performance and to take your questions. It's been a long time, too long. It is a privilege to be with you here today. Before I begin, I would like to address the ongoing tragedy in Ukraine. The war is destroying lives, putting millions at risks and displacing many. It is a terrible tragedy. To support humanitarian efforts, TD has provided more than $1 million in donations, and we have activated our branch and store network to collect donations from customers. We're also working with specialized groups to help refugees find meaningful employment, including at TD to help stabilize their families in a new country. We all hope the suffering will end as soon as possible. Let me now update you on our progress over the past year and on our views on the future. At the very beginning of this pandemic, I told you that TD would successfully navigate the crisis and emerge stronger and more resilient. Today, I am pleased to report that our bank, your bank is stronger. In fact, it is stronger than it has ever been. I want to recognize the tremendous efforts of more than 90,000 TD bankers around the world. I could not be more proud of the dedication and determination, and I thank them from the bottom of my heart. Throughout 2021, colleagues supported millions of households and businesses. Our people were there when our customers needed us most, providing thoughtful advice to help them navigate a challenging period with confidence. As a result of their efforts and the important investments we've made across the bank, we delivered strong results in every business. In Canada, we finished the year with continued momentum, delivering strong volumes as we supported a growing customer base. We also reported record wealth and insurance premium revenues while adding new products and capabilities. This included TD Easy Trade, our easy-to-use stock trading app in an industry-leading mobile platform for home and auto insurance. TD Wealth assets now sit at over $1 trillion, reflecting the trust we have earned from those we serve. In the U.S., we also introduced a number of new offerings and products to better serve our customers and grow our business. TD Bank, America's most convenient bank delivered record earnings as we offered an unexpectedly human customer experience across all channels. Improving top line growth reflected strong deposit volumes and a steady recovery in consumer activity. In wholesale, we delivered strong results once again, winning key client mandates and advancing our U.S. dollar strategy. As a result of focused efforts across the bank, the overall macroeconomic recovery and reductions in our credit loss provisions, the bank's earnings recovered, and we achieved our best year ever. Adjusted earnings were $14.6 billion, up 47% from 2020 and 17% higher from 2019's pre-pandemic levels. Supported by these results, we continue to invest in new capabilities to serve our almost 27 million customers and transform our operations to deliver innovation and execution with even greater speed. And when regulators allowed it, we increased our dividend by 13% and repurchased 21 million common shares. Throughout the year, we strengthened our bank, grew our business, served our customers and lived our purpose. In doing so, we created value for you, our shareholders. To further accelerate our growth, earlier this year, we announced an exciting transaction. The acquisition of First Horizon is a tremendous opportunity. It is strategically compelling and at closing, we'll immediately provide TD with scale in the U.S. Southeast. It will give us leadership positions in Tennessee and Louisiana deepen our existing presence in Virginia, the Carolinas and Florida and established important footholds in Georgia and Texas. These are highly attractive markets where the population is expected to grow approximately 50% faster than the national average. The transaction is also financially attractive and will allow us to deploy our excess capital to enhance long-term earnings growth. And it is a strong cultural fit. First Horizon has a similar approach to managing risk. The retail and commercial bankers like ours, share our commitment to customer service and community presence. Work is underway to obtain the required approvals, and we expect to close the transaction in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. I look forward to introducing you to First Horizon's leaders this time next year. As you can see, we accomplished a lot this past year, yet there's always more to do. Customer expectations continue to rapidly evolve. They want digital experiences that resemble their favorite online retailers or streaming services, personalized value advice to navigate a challenging environment and a trusted partner that will bring their aspirations to life. TD has built the capabilities to meet these needs. We have a deep pool of expert bankers, a strong branch and store network in Canada and the United States and a growing online and digital presence, including clear leadership as Canada's largest mobile bank. We will continue to provide legendary personalized and connected experiences across customers' channels of choice in store, on the phone, online and on the go. To help power our future, we are also developing and adding customer-facing resources across the bank and deepening our bench of innovation, talent with engineers, computer scientists, data analysts and AI experts. To exceed our customers' expectations and move at the speed of the market, we are methodically shifting how we work to drive even faster innovation and execution at scale. Through these and other efforts, TD is shaping the future of banking. As we focus on our strategy and delivered for all stakeholders, we also took steps to address important priorities critical to our collective future. There is no doubt that climate change is an urgent societal, environmental and business challenge that is fundamentally impacting current and future generations. We strongly support the transition to a low-carbon economy and have made significant commitments to help accelerate its development. We started the year by setting a clear direction with an ambitious climate action plan and became the first Canadian bank to set a 2050 net 0 target. We backed that commitment with action. We joined the UN-convened Net-Zero banking alliance to foster better global collaboration. We established clear interim targets for Scope 1 and 2 emissions and recently announced our first school 3 finance emissions targets for the energy and power generation sectors. In addition, this past year, TD Securities has helped deliver over $31 billion in sustainable financing in Canada, the U.S. and globally. We are helping the businesses we support, accelerate their plans, seize new opportunities and drive change through a specialized sustainable finance and corporate transitions group. These and other efforts delivered important progress, which we reported through a full suite of detailed reports. However, as we invest and focus on accelerating change, we know that the transition to a low carbon future will not happen overnight. It will require a determined effort over many years as we reshape entire industries and build a new economy. As we work to accelerate change and progress, energy security remains critically important through the transition. Without a reliable and responsible energy supply to meet our current and future demand, progress may solve with devastating economic and social consequences. The pressure on energy supply as a result of the war in Ukraine is a clear example of the risks. Canada can and must play a meaningful role to support energy security in both North America and globally. I encourage policymakers to continue to support and develop the responsible energy projects we need today as we all work to transition our economies for longer-term sustainable growth. The future must also be more inclusive, a society where all have the opportunity to thrive is the only path forward. We've seen the devastating impacts of buyers and racism, the vicious cycle that comes from economic inequality and the pain caused by violence and hate. TD is committed to being a force for change and for progress. We've set new representation targets internally, deployed training throughout the bank and have kept diversity and inclusion at the forefront of our efforts. In our communities, we've invested in new programs to support [racialized] minorities, launch initiatives to foster broader economic participation and committed our financial and human resources to help build a better tomorrow. In 2021 alone, we invested $125 million in our communities through the TD Ready Commitment, contribute directly to these and other goals. This included $10 million through the TD Ready Challenge to fund 15 organizations that are addressing learning laws in children due to pandemic disruptions, a critical need to support the success of future generations. We also launched new initiatives to encourage greater economic inclusion and access to banking. In Canada, we announced an exclusive strategic alliance with Canada Post to increase access to financial services in rural, remote and indigenous communities. And in the U.S., we introduced TD Essential Banking, a low-cost deposit account designed to meet the needs of unbanked and underbanked households. At TD, we know that we are only as strong as the communities in which we live and work. As we invest for the future with growing confidence, we must also recognize that we meet today at a complex moment. We have started to gather again in homes and restaurants, sports and entertainment venues. friends are reconnecting. Families are traveling, and colleagues are collaborating in person more frequently. You can feel the energy returning to our communities. While COVID is still clearly with us, we are learning to live with it, to adjust as needed sometimes on a daily basis as we reopen our economies. I'm hopeful that very soon life on a screen will take even more of a back seat. It's about time. A small business is rebuilt and harden sectors begin to recover, millions of people are finding jobs and coming off government programs. Governments rightly backstopped our economies and supported millions during the downturn. They were directly assisted by banks who deferred billions in loan and mortgage payments and build new capabilities literally overnight to help get funds to those who needed them. However, as we look to the future, it will be important for governments to reduce deficit built up during the pandemic and focus on growth. The federal government took some initial steps in the right direction in last week's budget, but it is important to press further on this going forward. Sound fiscal policy is critical to a prosperous future, particularly to maintain global confidence in Canada as a destination for business activity and investment. It also provides governments with levers and options should they need to respond to any future crisis. We cannot face the next crisis with limited means to address it. This matters because there are already numerous issues before us that require our attention. Inflation is back with serious potential macroeconomic repercussions if it is not effectively manage. Global supply disruptions are contributing to this problem and also threaten to slow the recovery of many businesses. And the war in Europe is creating serious economic impacts globally. We need to tackle these challenges with new approaches. For example, we should develop new manufacturing and production capabilities to help taper long-term inflation and maintain the flow of consumer goods and other products, including PPE and vaccines. We must also invest in and enhance our health care system so that we are prepared to show -- should another health emergency impact us in the future. I'm extremely optimistic about our future. Canada has all the right ingredients to address these issues and build for the future if you can leverage them appropriately. We have a highly skilled workforce with first-class universities training the next generation. We're emerging as a global technology leader growing rapidly and competing successfully for investment and talent. We continue to be a global leader in food production, and we are well positioned to become a responsible source of energy security. I believe we can achieve our full potential, but we must create the right conditions for success. One of our greatest advantages is that we have among the strongest and most stable financial systems in the world, a sector that serves us well supports millions of jobs and delivers value to all Canadians. We must extend our leadership on the world stage as a global banking center. Unfortunately, in its most recent budget, the government has chosen instead to single out our sector, which I believe is not good tax policy and could lead to unintended consequences. As we look ahead, it is critically important that we build on our strengths and unite public and private sector efforts around common goals. At TD, we look forward to participating in that dialogue. Our job at TD is to support these efforts and to successfully steer the bank forward as we serve the millions who rely on us. As I've always said, banking serves a higher purpose. We will continue to offer colleagues the opportunity to make a meaningful impact, grow their careers and work in an inclusive culture of care and respect. We will serve customers and clients with passion and skill and help them transform their aspirations into reality. We will guide our clients through complex transformations and contribute directly to sustainable future prosperity. We will help our economies recover and businesses rebuild, and we will drive progress and positive change in society at large across every community in which we operate. To the work ahead, we will deploy the resources of our strong bank with high-performing businesses backed by leading innovation and new capabilities. Of course, as always, our true strength comes from our people, our greatest competitive advantage, their commitment to the bank, to our customers and to our communities continues to be remarkable. Our purpose to enrich lives comes to life every day through their efforts. And once again, I thank them for everything they do to make TD the better bank. Fellow shareholders. I also want to thank you for your support over the past year. All of us at TD continue to work hard every day to earn your trust.

13,1,How to attract staff as inflation soars? A nice fat bonus helps,789 words,The Observer,"Some employers, however, are ramping up bonuses in an attempt to lure new recruits and retain existing staff, as record job vacancies intensify the battle for talent and companies work to support staff hit by dwindling spending power. Figures from the Office for National Statistics[https://www-ons-gov-uk.proxy.library.nyu.edu/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/averageweeklyearningsearn01] last week showed the value of bonuses paid across the economy jumped by almost a quarter in the year to February, the highest level of one-off awards relative to basic wages since 2013. While the biggest payouts went to bankers and accountants in the City of London after a boom year for the finance industry, the data also reveals a marked rise in retail, construction and hospitality bonuses. In some sectors, employers are finding creative ways to attract and retain staff. Alongside a bumper 34% rise in finance bonuses, the ONS figures show payouts up by 20% in construction and by 19% in wholesale retail, hotels and restaurants. âBonuses are a lot higher this year than last,ï¿½?said Tony Wilson of the Institute for Employment Studies thinktank. âAcross the economy itâs adding about a percentage point to pay growth right now. Itâs being dragged up by large bonuses in finance, but there are proportionate big increases in other industries too.ï¿½?Britainâs cost-of-living crisis hit its fourth month in February[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/12/jump-uk-wages-fails-ease-cost-living-crisis-prices] as average earnings growth, including bonuses, of 5.4% failed to keep pace with a 6.2% increase in the consumer price index. Inflation rose further in March, to 7%, and[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/13/inflation-march-britain-cost-of-living-soars] for those who didnât get a bonus, things were far worse, with average pay up just 4%. Workers in the public sector are falling furthest behind, because one-off payouts are rare for NHS staff, council workers, teachers and police. In real terms, average weekly pay in the public sector is falling at the fastest rate in 20 years[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61077200]. Economists say there are two primary reasons why bosses could be considering paying bonuses. First, with record job vacancies and an unexpected fall in unemployment after the end of furlough, workers have more bargaining power. Several firms ï¿½?including Starbucks[https://uk.indeed.com/viewjob?cmp=Starbucks&t=Barista+Customer+Service&jk=2065b5416eac819e&q=%22signing+bonus%22&vjs=3], Dominoâs Pizza[https://uk.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=0ce29dfb31741b5e&q=%22signing+bonus%22&l=London&tk=1g0hqui1at3cu802&from=web&advn=5028436370913813&adid=375070357&ad=-6NYlbfkN0A2TE5pEuZoHxwwsSRtGPbgq5ODhRpyjFqDVfxmhSmuDIluPD86BWK5Hm-dHo75b6MVFAAlzWMuI-4AnIvLg2Ic9N_FTsPWpygem24BWzoZHd7Of3riCw1Nxwyn0Nz_Fv1If-GDtVOgIXDTvkDnwv04Bp0ebBHz-NBAGnXH9riK0-RKUFtP9wpMtrAD585sdOr8EcKGwT8kd_oPIwSBlZmIdTYZKwcWsCiI6vD6IBaytlR9sVSRJ3e0K4FGYjHFPLTgmBgq2vahcQQi4wzOwYQxmdqjnIw8CWZDxlReNGpFUt90ljlRWDgkb2ZyA_HMfQzRQsBHvHRFbCTPQCZPJWVgoqa940FDIBTu8swPR68VPw%3D%3D&pub=4a1b367933fd867b19b072952f68dceb&vjs=3] and Holiday Inn[https://uk.indeed.com/viewjob?cmp=Holiday-Inn&t=Food+Beverage+Team+Member&jk=de0ca27c41b4a09f&q=%22signing+bonus%22&vjs=3] ï¿½?are using one-off joining bonuses to attract recruits: these can be more eyecatching than headline pay rates. Second, employers may believe the inflation shock is likely to fade next year. Paying one-off bonuses avoids permanently higher wage bills, at a time when firms are unsure about how profitable they might be in future. âThe thing about wages is they are sticky. They go up but donât go down very quickly,ï¿½?said Jonathan Boys, a labour market economist at the Chartered Institute of Professional Development. âIf you want sustained wage growth, it has to be because weâre better at doing stuff, weâre more productive. Thatâs the long-term gain.ï¿½?Faced with soaring demand for international travel after lockdown,  British Airways is offering Â£1,000 welcome bonuses ï¿½?two years after it attempted to sack thousands of staff[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/17/ba-begins-to-carry-out-its-fire-and-rehire-threat-to-jobs] at the height of the pandemic. Sharon Graham, general secretary of the Unite union, which represents BA workers, said the âsign-on bribesï¿½?would do little to solve recruitment and retention problems if they still came with low base pay and lousy conditions. âItâs really very simple ï¿½?to attract workers, employers have to offer pay and conditions that match, if not better, whatâs on offer elsewhere,ï¿½?she said. âThatâs what Unite is fighting for ï¿½?decent wages on decent conditions. So far, our collective bargaining strength has won a huge number of wage deals well above inflation.ï¿½?Some employers are trying more creative retention techniques. According to jobs website Indeed, the number of vacancies offering perks such as wellbeing programmes ï¿½?including mental health support ï¿½?has risen by 1,719% compared with before the pandemic. Employers are also offering gym memberships, subsidised travel and financial advice. Last year, employers including Amazon, Ocado and Tesco offered signing-on bonuses worth thousands of pounds before the Christmas rush. Figures from Indeed show signing-on bonuses rising particularly sharply in social care, a sector where employers might struggle to pay a permanently higher wage bill. However, union leaders have warned that bonuses, which do not usually count towards a workerâs pension, typically fail to make up for lower pay, following a decade of stagnating average wage growth and a squeeze on UK living standards."
347,1,Business News: Publicis Posts Solid Growth but Takes Russia Loss,429 words,The Wall Street Journal,"That is despite the continuing pandemic, the conflict in Ukraine and the consequences of inflation for its clients, Publicis said. It said its first-quarter performance would ordinarily have led it to upgrade its expectations for the year, but those factors are creating too much uncertainty to do so now.  Publicis's decision last month to stop doing business in Russia and to transfer ownership of its agencies there to local management resulted in an 87 million euro exceptional disposal loss, equivalent to $94.2 million, in the first quarter. ""We are still very confident in our ability to deliver what we have promised in February,"" Chief Executive Arthur Sadoun said. The company expects to see organic growth, which strips out the effects of currency fluctuations, acquisitions and disposals, of 5% in the current quarter, he said. Mr. Sadoun last week said in a video to staff that he had undergone surgery for a cancerous tumor, but that the tumor was identified early and that there was no reason to worry. Mr. Sadoun said he was back to work and in the office. He plans to stay in Paris in May and June to continue treatment.  Publicis reported net revenue of 2.8 billion euros, equivalent to more than $3 billion, in the first quarter, up 17% from 2.4 billion euros in 2020. The company said a third of its net revenue is coming from its Epsilon and Publicis Sapient businesses, which it says are helping marketers shift away from tracking cookies and invest more in ""owned"" media such as brands' social-media feeds.  Alphabet Inc.'s Google plans to block the user-tracking technology called third-party cookies in its Chrome browser starting next year, driving many marketers to seek other ways of targeting customers. Social media, commerce platforms and branded content have given brands new potential paths to reach customers, as audiences are declining for some paid ad channels such as traditional TV commercials.

169,1,Nigeria - Institutions and Energy Policy - Electricity,343 words,Global Energy Research,"The country plans to increase access to electricity to 90% in 2030 (58% in 2020). In 2017, the government launched the Power Sector Recovery Programme (2017-2021), which intends to ensure baseline power generation, transmission, and distribution, improve DISCOs performance, and address issues constraining gas availability to the power sector. The plan seeks to restore the sector's financial viability, improve power supply reliability, and establish a contract-based electricity market. The plan is supported by a US$3bn World Bank loan, which could expand by US$1bn at a later stage. In 2019, the government presented a new electricity distribution policy named ""Willing Seller, Willing Buyer"". Under the scheme, electricity would be wheeled directly from the generation companies to willing consumers who are ready to fully pay their bills. In 2013 and 2014, the NERC developed and issued a set of interim rules in order to operate the electricity market. A Transitional Electricity Market (TEM) started in 2015 as the first private power market in Africa. Under the TEM, electricity trading is done through contracts; there should be no more governmental control and administration. NBET, Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trader, is a state entity responsible for purchasing electricity from generation companies under long-term PPA and selling it to distribution companies. Currently, nearly 15Â GW are contracted under PPA or interim agreements. Previously, the Electric Power Sector Reform Act of 2005 privatised the national electricity company, PHCN (Power Holding Company of Nigeria), which ended in 2014 with the creation of 11 distribution companies (DISCOs) and 6 generation companies (GENCOs). The National Integrated Power Projects (NIPP) launched in 2004 by the Government led to the commissioning of 8 gas-fired power plants by NDPHC (Niger Delta Power Holding Company). Since 2013, the federal government has been trying to privatise NDPHC's power plants. Last Updated: 20210801"

As detailed below, the lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) Rivian would not meet its 2021 production and delivery targets; (2) Rivian's vehicles were underpriced and the Company would need to substantially increase prices; and (3) as a result, Defendants' representations about the Company's business, operations, and prospects lacked a reasonable basis.  Rivian is an electric vehicle company that in 2018 unveiled its first consumer EV's, the R1T electric pickup truck, and the R1S electric SUV. On November 10, 2021, Rivian offered 153 million shares to the public through an IPO at a price of $78.00 per share for total proceeds of $11.93 billion. According to the Registration Statement, the ""R1T and R1S introduce our brand to the world and will serve as our flagship vehicles as we continue to expand our offerings.""  Rivian's focus on its reputation for transparency and devotion to its customers, along with Rivian's R1T and R1S, including the large number of preorders and potential for increased demand were key selling points to IPO investors. Unbeknownst to investors, however, the Registration Statement's representations were materially inaccurate, misleading, and/or incomplete because they failed to disclose, among other things, that the R1T and R1S were underpriced to such a degree that Rivian would have to raise prices shortly after the IPO and that these price increases would tarnish Rivian's reputation as a trustworthy and transparent company and would put a significant number of the existing backlog of 55,400 preorders along with future preorders in jeopardy of cancellation. As a result, the price of the Company's shares was artificially and materially inflated at the time of the Offering. On March 1, 2022, Rivian announced that it was raising the prices of its R1T pickup and R1S SUV by 17 percent and 20 percent, respectively, and that the new prices would apply to nearly all preorders. At the time of the announcement, Rivian had only produced and sold roughly 1,000 vehicles. A March 2, 2022 article in the online publication ARS Technica, titled ""Rivian surprises, outrages EV truck buyers with 20% price hike,"" questioned the reasons behind the price increases. An article published in Electrek on March 2, 2022, titled ""Rivian buyers are cancelling at alarming rates after price increases,"" noted that: ""A poll on the Rivian subreddit, one of the biggest communities of Rivian fans, gives us a better idea of the pulse of the reservation holders, and it shows a high cancelation rate"" and provided a screenshot of the poll, which showed a majority of voters planned to cancel their reservations. By the commencement of the class action lawsuit, the price of Rivian shares closed at $42.43 per share, significantly below their $78.00 IPO Price. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Wahlbergâs passion for cars started when he used to work as a mechanic as a teenager, and now all grown up the Max Payne actor once reportedly shelled out more than half a million dollars for his distinctive 2014 Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe, complete with two-tone colour scheme and rear-hinged doors. From Patek Phillipe to Rolexes, The Italian Job star sure loves his exquisite timepieces. According to the DâMarge website, the actor owns dozens of Rolexes and is often the first person to receive hot new products straight from the watchmaker. Meanwhile, his Patek Philippe Reference 6002 Sky Moon Tourbillon ï¿½?the brandâs most complicated watch ï¿½?has a 44mm case in rose gold with 12 complications and a front dial that combines Grand Feu champlevÃ© and cloisonnÃ© enamelling. The Wahlbergs live in a 30,000 sq ft French-style manor in Beverly Hills, which YouTube channel The Richest has described as a ""US$100 million mansionï¿½? It features 11 bedrooms, 18 bathrooms, a full-size basketball court, pool, wine cellar, spa and golf putting green. The spacious backyard is enveloped with lush greens while the interior shows coffered ceilings, limestone floors and a fireplace. But Wahlbergâs prized room is, of course, his state-of-the-art gym filled with every fitness equipment piece one can think of: stacks of dumbbells, cardio machines, and many more fearsome-looking contraptions. During the 2020 quarantine, Wahlberg treated fans to a sneak peek inside his French palace-inspired home, sharing a throng of videos and pictures of his wife Rhea Durham and their four adorable children. The family moved into their purpose-built mansion in 2013 after selling his previous seven-bedroom, 10-bathroom estate, which went for more than US$12 million. While he loves his fast cars and Swiss luxury watches, Wahlberg is also a fashionista. He has often sported head-to-toe Louis Vuitton during his public appearances, but his most enthusiast collection is definitely his Air Jordan trainers. According to People, The Departed actor had well over 100 pairs of kicks, which were valued at around US$100,000 in 2015. At a Boston Celtics game in 2020, his young son Brendan sported a pair of the rare Air Jordan IV Wahlburgers trainers ï¿½?an exclusive collaboration between the actorâs restaurant chain and the Jordan brand in 2018. When youâre Mark Wahlberg, there is no other way to quarantine but like a king. Back in 2020, while shooting a commercial for bookmakers Ladbrokes, the Boogie Nights star received government permission to self isolate with his crew at a luxury retreat outside Byron Bay, Australia. The house came with a US$400,000 fortnightly price tag, round-the-clock security team and a private ambulance on standby. He reportedly quarantined for two weeks and insisted on bringing his own gym equipment from the US. Want more stories like this?

306,1,Hays: Jobs market and wages strong,293 words,"The Journal, Newcastle","He added there is a shortage of skills worldwide as firms embark on a hiring spree across economies emerging from the pandemic. Technology specialists are among the most in demand due to a push for digital transformations across corporates worldwide, according to Hays. Mr Venables said: ""It's the highest permanent recruitment market in my 16 years with Hays and the highest wage inflation I've seen.""  Hays hailed a record performance at the start of 2022 due to the hot jobs market but revealed a hit of around Â£5 million after pulling out of Russia. The group posted a 32% surge in like-for-like fees over its third quarter to the end of March, with record-breaking results across 19 countries and its highest ever monthly fees in March. Fees in the UK and Ireland rose 29%, it added. Hays said the closure early last month of its offices in Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine will result in about Â£5 million in oneoff costs. The sites in Moscow and St Petersburg - which employed 245 staff - accounted in half-year results for around Â£5.9 million in group fees and about 1% or Â£800,000 of company earnings. Full-year guidance remains for full-year operating profits of Â£210 million to Â£215 million."
689,0,"This took a few hours to make': Instagram scam offers users gift, then steals their account via linked website",395 words,The Straits Times,"In cases seen by The Straits Times, users first receive a message from a follower with a compromised account claiming he has a gift for them. The message usually says: ""This took a few hours to make. I hope you love it."" The contents of these gifts are never specified. The message comes with a personalised link directing them to a separate website that includes the receivers' username, tricking them into believing the link was crafted especially for them. Shortly after, swindlers gain access to the user's account and use it to broadcast a similar scam message to other followers, who in turn, may be deceived into thinking their friends are offering them a gift. A similar line of Instagram scams was reported in overseas media, including The Independent in the United Kingdom, which warned that the login page is a sham that allows hackers to enter users' accounts. It reported: ""There (are) no gifts - and instead, that page will simply steal a user's password, with affected people reporting that they are simply thrown onto an online gambling page at the end."" Hackers will then have access to a user's password, allowing them to send the same message to other users, The Independent wrote. It urged users to take caution before entering passwords on any website. Responding to queries from The Straits Times, a spokesman for Meta, which runs Instagram, urged users to pick strong, unique passwords and never share them with people they do not trust. The spokesman added that users should turn on two-factor authentication in their settings for added security, but did not provide further details on the scam. She pointed to an advisory under Meta that warns users not to trust messages that offer gifts, demand for money or threaten to delete their account, and to promptly report such cases to Instagram or Facebook, which Meta also operates."
615,1,"ROSEN, Globally Respected Investor Counsel, Encourages Rivian Automotive, Inc. Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - RIVN",694 words,Newsfile,"WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rivian class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=3880[https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/8AxR7FQjbY] or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com[mailto:pkim@rosenlegal.com] or cases@rosenlegal.com[mailto:cases@rosenlegal.com] for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than May 6, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, the IPO offering documents were materially inaccurate, misleading, and/or incomplete because they failed to disclose, among other things, that the R1T electric pickup truck and the R1S electric sport utility vehicle (SUV) were underpriced to such a degree that Rivian would have to raise prices shortly after the IPO and that these price increases would tarnish Rivian's reputation as a trustworthy and transparent company and would put a significant number of the existing backlog of 55,400 preorders along with future preorders in jeopardy of cancellation.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

971,0,Details of home testing for schoolchildren still open - STM is preparing a recommendation on a quick schedule*** TRANSLATED ***,552 words,STT,"The Coronation Ministerial Working Group concluded on Friday that primary and secondary school students are recommended to take two home tests per week. According to STT's information, the government team had estimated that home testing would be launched within a couple of weeks of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health's(STM) issuing a recommendation to the municipalities. STM will prepare the recommendation as soon as possible. Experts from STM were told on Monday that they were so busy that they did not have time to comment on the preparation. Among other things, the question is whether the test is recommended for everyone or, for example, only for the symptomatic. Municipalities decide on implementation The practical implementation is entirely up to the municipalities. Much depends, for example, on how municipalities decide to procure home tests, whether they are procured jointly or separately. One possibility is to utilize the Security of Supply Center in procurement. The center was told by the BTI on Monday that there is nothing new to tell about the acquisition of rapid tests for schoolchildren. The matter is currently being discussed between STM, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy(TEM) and the municipalities. The idea of the coronation ministerial working group has been that home tests be distributed in schools, but this is also a matter for the municipality to decide. THL is expected to provide an opinion on home testing as a basis for its decisions. THL did not respond to STT's request for comments on Monday. It is still possible that distance learning will eventually have to end if the epidemic situation so requires. STM fears a collapse in healthcare carrying capacity STM reportedly fears that within two weeks, the capacity of health care in the Helsinki and Uusimaa hospital districts and in Southwest Finland will fail due to the rapid spread of the micron transformation. Coronation ministers will meet this week to decide, among other things, whether preparations to close the restaurants altogether should begin. An impact assessment on the closure of restaurants has been requested at least from THL. The assessment is complicated by the fact that omicron spreads so rapidly that the sources of infections cannot be traced. The full closure of restaurants was implemented in 2020 under exceptional circumstances, but now it would be attempted to be implemented without exception under completely new legislation. Last week, Minister of Labor Tuula Haatainen(sd.) Estimates that if a full closure of restaurants is reached, the preparation of legislation on it would take at least a couple of weeks, including rounds of opinions and parliamentary deliberations. *** DISCLAIMER: THIS IS AN AUTOMATED TRANSLATION FROM FINNISH ***"

It said its first-quarter performance would ordinarily have led it to upgrade its expectations for the year, but those factors are creating too much uncertainty to do so now.  Publicis's decision last month to stop doing business in Russia[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/publicis-is-latest-ad-company-to-pull-out-of-russia-11647364219] and to transfer ownership of its agencies there to local management resulted in an ï¿½?7 million exceptional disposal loss, equivalent to $94.2 million, in the first quarter. ""We are still very confident in our ability to deliver what we have promised in February,"" Chief Executive Arthur Sadoun said in an interview. The company expects to see organic growth, which strips out the effects of currency fluctuations, acquisitions and disposals, of 5% in the current quarter, he said. Mr. Sadoun last week said in a video to staff that he had undergone surgery for a cancerous tumor, but that the tumor was identified early and that there was no reason to worry.

684,0,Pakistan's opposition rejects toughened new social media law,261 words,Associated Press Newswires,"Suspects arrested under the law will not be entitled to bail during trial. The legislation takes effect immediately. âIt is an attack on freedom of expression,"" Maryam Aurangzeb, a spokesperson for the Pakistan Muslim League opposition party told reporters at a news conference.  Yusuf Raza Gilani, a senior leader of the opposition Pakistan People's Party, at a separate news conference, said his party will challenge the new law in the court because it is aimed at curbing media freedom. Almost all of Pakistan's other opposition parties and journalist unions have also opposed the new law, which was approved by Alvi days after authorities arrested media owner Mohsin Baig. Baig had appeared on a TV talk show and suggested that Prime Minister Imran Khan had shown favoritism this month by granting an award to a Cabinet minister Murad Saeed with whom he has a close friendship. Although the government says it supports freedom of speech, critics say the space for media freedom has shrunk in Pakistan since Khanâs government came into power in 2018."
318,0,Hong Kong's 'zero covid' days are over. But where's the exit plan?,917 words,Washington Post.com,"Though much of the United States is edging into post-pandemic normalcy ï¿½?albeit against the advice of many health experts ï¿½?Hong Kong is in the grips of a brutal fifth wave and resorting to extreme measures more common in 2020 than 2022. Flights are banned from nine countries, including the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia. Nonresidents from nearly 140 countries are barred. There is no airmail service to the United States. The daily covid-19 case count recently passed 6,000, with 15 deaths in a recent 24-hour period, and epidemiologists predict cases will likely reach tens of thousands per day. Anyone testing positive is sent into isolation facilities, straining available spaces. In scenes reminiscent of New York City in early 2020, patients have been left outdoors on gurneys or sitting in plastic chairs in the cold February air, waiting for a hospital bed. The city is short of manpower, coronavirus testing kits, quarantine spaces and supplies, and city leaders have been forced to appeal to Beijing for help. For two years, Hong Kong was a model for how to keep the coronavirus at bay, through aggressive contact tracing, on-and-off closures of public spaces and strict social distancing rules. It also boasted one of the world's harshest quarantine regimes, requiring most incoming travelers to spend 21 days in a hotel room at their own expense. It became increasingly isolated and was ridiculed for some of its more drastic steps, such as ordering a mass cull of pet hamsters. But the measures largely worked. So why is Hong Kong entering a crisis just as other countries are opening up? The ostensible reason, offered by local officials and health experts, is that the share of elderly people vaccinated remains pitifully low, less than 40 percent of those over 80. But that's just part of the story. More important have been failures of policy, planning and public messaging. The policy failure has been the government's insistence on sticking with its ""zero covid"" approach, trying to stamp out every case and cut every transmission chain. Local leaders had no real choice, because the policy was imposed by mainland China. Hong Kong desperately wants to fully reopen the border to the mainland, and adhering to ""zero covid"" is the price. But Hong Kong is different from the mainland. It's a dense urban metropolis, an international hub that needs people flying in and out. And its residents are less accustomed to being controlled, more jealous of safeguarding their privacy rights and more likely to flout rules imposed by a distrusted, disliked local government. This defiance has led to an underground economy of people trying to make ends meet. Gym trainers take their mats and equipment to parks to continue lessons. Hair stylists, masseuses and yoga teachers are making home visits. New outdoor watering holes skirt the closure of bars by offering alcoholic drinks with limited take-out food items that no one seems to order. Hong Kong's tough policies always contained multiple exceptions and exemptions, and locals are now taking advantage of loopholes. There was also an abysmal failure of planning. Having kept the caseload and death count to a minimum, officials appear to have been lulled into complacency. They had two years to purchase the millions of test kits now needed, build trust in vaccines and make contingency plans for a surge that would leave hospitals swamped. When this current wave became a tsunami, officials were still meeting and discussing where to build a new makeshift hospital and quarantine center. Finally, there have been glaring issues with messaging. The government expended much effort touting the benefits of the new national security law and promoting its ""patriots only"" election. But not enough was done to prepare the population for an inevitable outbreak. Because the government spent years treating covid-19 as a largely overseas concern, many elderly residents saw little reason to get vaccinated. Can this latest outbreak be contained? And is the ""zero covid"" policy sustainable with omicron running rampant? ""Maybe. If you close off the borders and severely restrict internal activities within Hong Kong long enough, it is theoretically possible to stop transmission,"" said Keiji Fukuda, until recently the director of the School of Public Health of the University of Hong Kong and a veteran of the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But, he said, that would require broad public cooperation and exact a heavy economic toll. ""The real question is not whether the virus can be put back in the bottle,"" he said, ""but what is the end game for this policy?"" In other words, ""zero covid"" in Hong Kong is over. All that's missing is the exit plan."

704,1,"Nigeriaâs Kudi, Africaâs Financial Technology Company, Changes Name to Nomba; Makes strategic appointments to expand business as it provides a gateway between cash and digital",1098 words,African Press Organization,"This solution could not have come at a more opportune time. From neighborhood kiosks to high-brow restaurants and fashion stores, the small business segment in Nigeria is responsible for 86 percent of the total workforce through 41 million micro-businesses and 73,000 small and medium enterprises as indicated by the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) National Survey. Yet, payments in the retail sector in Nigeria are largely offline with over 25 million merchants yet to accept any form of digital payments. Many of the retail businesses who do accept digital payments lack a unified platform to seamlessly manage their businesses across multiple touch-points and locations. From payment collection, to trade financing, to intelligent business reporting, and even multiple location management, businesses largely depend on traditional financial services providers who do not provide the ecosystem of services that support their businesses. Having all of this on one platform will really make a difference and make business easier. With Nomba, underserved and full-fledged businesses can self-onboard in five minutes and order a full-service integrated terminal and dashboard designed to manage all their payment needs whether in cash, cards, transfers, USSD or QR across multiple channels and locations. Over the next six months, Nomba will extend the penetration of its POS terminals across the country, giving more businesses access to technology that delivers real-time oversight of all business transactions whether they are a one-man business or a corporate, all on one dashboard. It also plans to expand its product offerings into invoicing, payroll management and other tools that boost the productivity of businesses. To drive this expansion, the fintech has appointed two key new executives Jeffrey Williams as Vice President, Business, and Toluwani Ijogun as Vice President Brand, Marketing and Communications. Harnessing their experience and expertise, Nomba, willaccelerateits expansion across the country ensuring that over 350,000 businesses are equipped with all the tools required to run their businesses seamlessly, by the end of the year. As VP, Brand Marketing and Communications, Toluwani Ijogun will be responsible for brand strategy, including all consumer, business-to-business and partner marketing activities that advance the companyâs goals. She will also oversee all internal and external communications, insights and marketing capabilities and analytics for the brand. Toluwani brings with her over 15 years experience managing premium brands such as Guaranty Trust Bank; GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Plc; Philips across West Africa; Eat Nï¿½?Go (owners of Dominoâs Pizza and Coldstone Creamery franchise in Nigeria); FSDH Group and most recently as Senior Vice President: Brand and Marketing for Kuda Bank where she played a pivotal role in the companyâs growth in the Nigerian market. Jeffrey Williams-Edem brings over 18 years of experience in sales, business development strategy, digital payment and merchant acquisition spanning multiple industries. He joins Nomba as VP, Business from Interswitch where he played an integral role in the design and deployment of their first retail solution strategy for the micro, small and medium enterprise market in Nigeria. As Kudi transitions to Nomba, Jeffrey will be responsible for creating and driving the machinery to deliver on business acquisition, new market development and revenue. He will also oversee the sales, business operations and the development of new products. âSince our launch in 2017, our technology and insights have enabled merchants to earn and build successful businesses, transforming their own lives and that of others. Today, complimentary regulatory frameworks and well-thought-out partnerships with financial institutions have synergized to create an enabling environment for fintechs to chart the future of payments, making access to digital payment solutions ubiquitous. Over the next five years, we will be leveraging these factors, as well as the experience and expertise Jeff and Tolu bring to deepen the penetration of digital payment solutions across the country, making payments easier for everyone,ï¿½?said Yinka Adewale, Chief Executive Officer, Nomba. Nomba started its journey in 2017 as a chatbot designed to simplify payments. However, in 2018 it evolved into a company whose distinct point of sale (POS) technology, partnerships with banks and other licensed financial institutions democratized access to banking products and services for merchants across Nigeria. This also includes core banking solutions such as opening savings accounts and loans. Listed as a YCombinator Top Company in 2022, there are today over 150,000 businesses on the Nomba platform enabled to carry out card, cash and bank transfer related transactions for their own businesses and on behalf of their customers. With an onboarding rate of over 10,000 new businesses monthly, Nomba currently processes over $16m in payments daily across more than 500,000 unique transactions. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Nomba. For media enquiries: Toju Grage Nomba Brand, Marketing and Communications E:toju.grage@kudi.com Website:www.Nomba.com [http://www.Nomba.com]  About Nomba: We are building an ecosystem that simplifies how businesses accept payments, make payments and manage operations. This journey started in 2016 with simplifying access to financial services using ""Kudi.ai"" a chatbot integration that responds to financial requests on social apps. It then morphed into powering a community of independent businesses who act as neighborhood banks offering basic financial services such as cash withdrawal, transfer and bill payments to all Nigerians, especially those in underserved communities. We currently processes over $16m in payments daily across more than 500,000 unique transactions and have over 150,000 businesses on our platform. We believe this technology and innovative solution can power all kinds of businesses whether they are accepting payments for goods and services or helping others access cash or send money. So, we created easy-to-use tools with flexible options for all kinds of businesses to accept, process and manage payments online and offline. As we stay through to our mission to make financial services accessible and affordable, we are one step closer to bringing a lasting change to Africa and Africaâs commerce."
717,0,Ukraine invasion: TikTok's global ambitions take another hit as Russia's 'fake news' law forces suspension,723 words,scmp.com,"Chinese-owned app TikTok, the countryâs first social media platform with global influence, has suspended live streaming and new content in Russia to comply with a law that criminalises the spreading of what the Kremlin calls ""fake informationï¿½? The suspension of new uploads by users in Russia, which has a population of 144 million, is another setback for its global expansion plans after a permanent ban by New Delhi last year. TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, the worldâs most valuable unicorn, is not available in China as it was designed for the international market. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge [https://www.scmp.com/knowledge], our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. As such, it has largely followed its Western peers by banning Russian state media from using the app in the European Union, and by adding state media labels to certain channels. The TikTok policy is in sharp contrast to its Chinese version Douyin, which is filled with information sourced from Russian state media, amplified by Chinaâs own state media outlets. TikTokâs position is also not in line with the Chinese government, which has refused to call Russiaâs military action in Ukraine an ""invasionï¿½? and officially opposes any sanctions against Moscow. On Monday, Chinaâs foreign minister Wang Yi called [https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3169604/china-says-it-keen-play-constructive-role-resolving-ukraine?module=lead_hero_story&pgtype=homepage] Russia its ""most important strategic partnerï¿½? TikTok ""is acting in the interest of its employees and users to protect them from draconian laws,ï¿½?said Alex Capri, a research fellow at Hinrich Foundation and business lecturer at the National University of Singapore. However, ""as a Chinese company, the question will arise regarding possible pressure from Beijing to fall in line with Chinaâs geopolitical priorities and public position regarding Russiaï¿½? he added. In 2021, TikTok downloads in Russia totalled 26.4 million, accounting for 3.6 per cent of total downloads globally, including those for its Chinese sibling Douyin, according to market tracker Sensor Tower. While TikTok has played a key role in disseminating information about the war ï¿½?with some even calling it the ""TikTok Warï¿½?ï¿½?the platform remained silent for 10 days after Russiaâs invasion. On March 5, TikTok issued a statement highlighting its ""state-controlled media policyï¿½?and policy on ""combating misinformationï¿½? It would follow Twitter and Facebook to ""apply labels to content from some state-controlled media accountsï¿½? the TikTok statement said. TikTokâs attempts to walk a tightrope when it comes to the war in Ukraine reflect the challenges it faces in navigating geopolitical confrontations, even though the app has positioned itself as an apolitical platform where users can share fun videos. India, which used to be TikTokâs biggest market in terms of users, banned the app in the summer of 2020 after a deadly border clash with China, and made the ban permanent last year on national security grounds. TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew told Bloomberg last week that it was ""challenging to build a global companyï¿½?because ""you need to be global and local at the same timeï¿½? A week after Russia launched its military attack on Ukraine, the Kremlin passed a so-called ""fake newsï¿½?law that imposes prison sentences of up to 15 years on those spreading information that contradictrs the Russian governmentâs narrative on the war. The legislation coincided with Russiaâs blocking of Facebook and Twitter in Russia. Several Western digital giants, including Microsoft, Netflix and Epic Games, have also suspended sales in the country. Before TikTokâs suspension in Russia, the app had seen a slight dip in its popularity. In the week starting February 24, when Russian president Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operationï¿½?in Ukraine, TikTok had 476,000 and 118,000 downloads in Russia and Ukraine respectively, down from 516,000 and 127,000 a week before, according to Sensor Tower."

Image: https://www.accesswire.com/users/newswire/images/697657/image-1.pngFaruqi[https://www.accesswire.com/users/newswire/images/697657/image-1.pngFaruqi] & Faruqi is a leading minority and Woman-owned national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. As detailed below, the lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) Rivian would not meet its 2021 production and delivery targets; (2) Rivian's vehicles were underpriced and the Company would need to substantially increase prices; and (3) as a result, Defendants' representations about the Company's business, operations, and prospects lacked a reasonable basis.  Rivian is an electric vehicle company that in 2018 unveiled its first consumer EV's, the R1T electric pickup truck, and the R1S electric SUV. On November 10, 2021, Rivian offered 153 million shares to the public through an IPO at a price of $78.00 per share for total proceeds of $11.93 billion. According to the Registration Statement, the ""R1T and R1S introduce our brand to the world and will serve as our flagship vehicles as we continue to expand our offerings.""  Rivian's focus on its reputation for transparency and devotion to its customers, along with Rivian's R1T and R1S, including the large number of preorders and potential for increased demand were key selling points to IPO investors. Unbeknownst to investors, however, the Registration Statement's representations were materially inaccurate, misleading, and/or incomplete because they failed to disclose, among other things, that the R1T and R1S were underpriced to such a degree that Rivian would have to raise prices shortly after the IPO and that these price increases would tarnish Rivian's reputation as a trustworthy and transparent company and would put a significant number of the existing backlog of 55,400 preorders along with future preorders in jeopardy of cancellation. As a result, the price of the Company's shares was artificially and materially inflated at the time of the Offering. On March 1, 2022, Rivian announced that it was raising the prices of its R1T pickup and R1S SUV by 17 percent and 20 percent, respectively, and that the new prices would apply to nearly all preorders. At the time of the announcement, Rivian had only produced and sold roughly 1,000 vehicles. A March 2, 2022 article in the online publication ARS Technica, titled ""Rivian surprises, outrages EV truck buyers with 20% price hike,"" questioned the reasons behind the price increases. An article published in Electrek on March 2, 2022, titled ""Rivian buyers are cancelling at alarming rates after price increases,"" noted that: ""A poll on the Rivian subreddit, one of the biggest communities of Rivian fans, gives us a better idea of the pulse of the reservation holders, and it shows a high cancelation rate"" and provided a screenshot of the poll, which showed a majority of voters planned to cancel their reservations. By the commencement of the class action lawsuit, the price of Rivian shares closed at $42.43 per share, significantly below their $78.00 IPO Price. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

Spotify said they âregret Neilâs decision to remove his music from Spotify, but hope to welcome him back soon.ï¿½?Young takes issue with Rogan, the controversial and popular Spotify podcast host who the singer believes misleads on matters of masking and unproven COVID-19 remedies. âI want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform,ï¿½?he continued. âThey can have Rogan or Young. Not both.ï¿½?The ornery singer and activist, whose 1988 song This Noteâs for You is an antagonistic commentary on corporate concert sponsorship, hasnât toured since the pandemic began almost two years ago. âIâm still not playing anywhere,ï¿½?Young told The Globe and Mail[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/article-neil-young-cant-get-enough-barn-or-too-much-canada/] last December, upon the release of his album Barn. âI donât want to. I donât think weâre ready. I donât want to be part of a superspreader event. Iâm waiting until we get a grip on what weâre doing.ï¿½?Young is decidedly pro-vaccine, having suffered from polio as a child (as did Joni Mitchell). His fiery righteousness comes at a time when other rock-star elders are disappointing people at all turns. Last week, Bono trashed his own legacy when he said that many U2 songs make him cringe today. âIâve been in the car when one of our songs has come on the radio and Iâve been the colour of, as we say in Dublin, scarlet,ï¿½?Bono said in a Hollywood Reporter podcast. âIâm just so embarrassed.ï¿½?It was a thoughtless remark. The music of U2, for better or worse, means a lot to millions of people. In a self-serving attempt to appear humble, Bono trashed the tastes and the loyalty of his fans. The man who once sang âI want to run, I want to hideï¿½?would do well to heed that impulse. Legendary guitarist Eric Claptonâs long, sad descent into irrelevancy continued with more of his anti-vaccine discourse. In a Real Music Observer interview on YouTube[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1SWen95pkU] , he said people were being persuaded to accept masking and vaccines through âmass hypnosis formation.ï¿½?And then thereâs British musician Damon Albarn, frontman of the bands Blur and Gorillaz, who disrespected Taylor Swift in an interview with the Los Angeles Times[https://www-latimes-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/entertainment-arts/music/story/2022-01-23/damon-albarn-blur-gorillaz] , saying she âdoesnât write her own songsï¿½?and that co-writing âdoesnât count.ï¿½?Albarn, it should be noted, is famous for writing a âwoo-hooï¿½?chorus. After the social-media savvy Swift fired back at him on Twitter[https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1485714265675812866] , Albarn issued an apology. Whatâs interesting about Swiftâs post to Albarn is that she professed to being âsuch a big fanï¿½?of his. She was only 11 when Blurâs Song 2 was released. The adage ânever meet your heroes,ï¿½?then, is proving to be sound advice. The comments from Clapton, Bono and Albarn ï¿½?donât even mention Van Morrison[https://pagesix.com/2021/04/25/van-morrison-fights-backlash-over-anti-lockdown-songs/] ï¿½?are a total drag. Young has some advice for that: âDonât let it bring you down, itâs only castles burning,ï¿½?he sang in 1970. âFind someone whoâs turning, and you will come around.ï¿½?This week, Young just happens to be that someone.

348,1,Thai hotel firm will reopen luxuryï¿½?Rox,441 words,The Press and Journal,"Rox - formerly knownas the Metro and before that the Bon Accord -was acquired for anundisclosed sum througha joint venturebetween Compass and Singapore-based Seacare Hospitality. It is more than 13 years since Aberdeen businessman John Mitchell unveiled plans to convert the Metro - which he acquired from his brother, George, two years earlier - saying he was ploughing âa few million poundsï¿½?into creating a four-star establishment. The eight-storey hotel had belonged to Syrian businessman Jamie Dikir and before him Buchan farmer Joseph Penny. Bangkok-based Compass said it was in the midst of a post-pandemic surge in acquisitions. It did not say when it planned to reopen Rox, which closed in March 2020 at the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic and was swiftly put on the market with a Â£2 million price tag. A spokeswoman for the new operator said: âWe will be undertaking a substantial recruitment drive to fill between 15 to 20 available positions.ï¿½?The firm said its latest acquisition will feature âAberdeenâs premier chandelier-lit ballroomï¿½?and function space for 180 guests. âThis modern, four-star, 32-bedroom property boasts well-equipped en-suite accommodation, inclusive of two luxurious suites,ï¿½?it added. âThe hotel also offers the 100-cover Rox Grill Room restaurant, in addition to the 70-cover on-site cafe and bar.ï¿½?Rox will continue to âwelcome UK inbound and domestic visitors and tourists alike, as well as maintaining its base of local corporate guestsï¿½?

921,0,Jamie's Italian failure costs councils Â£1.3m,535 words,The Times,"Jamie's Italian owed local authorities Â£1.44 million in unpaid business rates and taxes when it collapsed in 2019. This is in addition to the Â£1.25 million that it owed to the taxman in unpaid VAT. The debts include tens of thou- sands of pounds owed to some of the poorest boroughs in the country. Newham council in east London where half of children live in poverty is owed Â£80,000. Over the past decade, Newham has had to close 13 of its 18 youth centres because of budget cuts. Jamie's Italian also owes Tower Hamlets council Â£55,000, Liverpool city council Â£108,000 and Manchester city council Â£90,000. Oliver, 46, is reported to have a fortune of more than Â£200 million while his holding company, which runs his publishing business, reported a profit of nearly Â£7 million last year. At its peak Jamie's Italian had 42 restaurants but from 2015 onwards the chain started struggling with bad customer reviews, discontent among staff and a wider slump in eating out. In 2019, despite efforts to save the business by closing several restaurants, the company collapsed with the loss of more than a thousand jobs.  KPMG's latest progress report on the administration estimates that less than Â£600,000 will be recovered from the business to return to unsecured trade creditors, such as councils and small businesses. Jamie's Italian owed these creditors Â£6.86 million. Small businesses that are set to lose out include five cleaning firms that are collectively owed Â£10,400, a waste management company that is owed more than Â£20,000, an electrical contractor that is owed Â£10,000 and a uniform supplier that is owed Â£11,500. The Times approached more than a dozen small businesses left with debts by the collapse but none of them wanted to comment. Creditors will be informed exactly how much they will get back next month. The KPMG documents also show that several prominent brands will end up out of pocket. The Hilton hotel at Tower Bridge, for example, is owed Â£55,000 and Belu, the bottled water company, is owed nearly Â£18,000. Rooms at the hotel start at Â£186 a night while 750ml bottles of the Belu cost less than Â£1 each wholesale. The documents show that Jamie's Italian had total debts of more than Â£80 million when it closed down, with the majority owed to banks and Jamie Oliver's holding company. However, at least Â£1.5 million of the debts owed to the holding company, which is majority-owned by the celebrity chef, will be returned because it is classed as a secured creditor.  KPMG says the administration process is due to be completed by May. Oliver declined to comment."
231,0,"SOK closes Prismat and hotels in St. Petersburg, no plans to return to Russia - Fazer's bakeries continue to operate in Russia*** TRANSLATED ***",508 words,STT,"According to Annala, business in St. Petersburg became challenging first with the corona pandemic and then with the war. The S Group emphasizes in its press release that it strongly condemns the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The company has already announced this week that it will remove products of Russian origin from the selections of its stores. SOK has 16 Prisma and three Sokos Hotels in St. Petersburg. There are a total of about a thousand employees. According to Annala, the exact schedule for the closure of both Prisms and the hotel is currently being determined, but the shutdown has already begun. - The aim is to sell Prisma's products on a fast schedule, Annala told STT by e-mail on Friday. According to Annala, the sanctions imposed on Russia by Western countries have, in practice, led to significant difficulties in payment transactions both within Russia and between Russia and Finland. Fazer's bakeries will continue to operate Fazer's bakeries will continue to operate in Russia, according to the company's press release. According to Fazer, the sudden closure of bakeries would cause humanitarian problems for the civilian population in St. Petersburg and Moscow, as bread is a staple food. According to Fazer, it and the company's local management are still bound by legal obligations and staff responsibilities. According to last year's financial statements, Fazer has about 2,300 employees in Russia. There are 4,000 employees in Finland. Earlier, Fazer said it would suspend the export of all its products from Finland to Russia. It has also suspended its investment in Russia. The operation of shopping centers partly owned by SRV will continue Construction company SRV has acted as a sub-investor in three shopping centers in Russia. The company says in its press release that shopping center operations in Russia will continue for the time being. - Our goal has been to gradually reduce operations in the Russian market by selling our stake in shopping centers, the press release says. The company says it is exploring opportunities to accelerate secession from Russia. According to the company, recent sanctions are also expected to affect the shopping center business. SRV's net sales in Russia last year were almost EUR 7 million. It consisted mainly of revenue from the operation of shopping centers and revenue from the sale of one project. In total, SRV's turnover last year was more than EUR 930 million. The company says it has outlined that it will completely stop sourcing building materials from Russia. *** DISCLAIMER: THIS IS AN AUTOMATED TRANSLATION FROM FINNISH ***"
512,1,The companies that venture capital can take to the 'casserole' in 2022,968 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"There are many companies that for one reason or another may be targeted by these opportunistic funds, which tend to look for cheap stocks with stable and consolidated businesses with an intrinsic value that the market is not recognizing at a given moment, such as the current one. For the investor, it can be a good option to anticipate these movements, which are a clear bullish signal for these stocks, but how to identify them? Stock market snails have some common characteristics. First of all, they are usually companies with moderate sizes, so that it is possible to take a significant stake for a not very high amount of money. They are also stable businesses with recurring profitability. In addition, they are usually subjects that have been unjustifiably penalized in the stock market, so they offer high potentials and large multiplier discounts. Finally, there is a factor that only some companies have and that is that they have a large shareholder who wants to decrease and exit completely from the capital. Among the stocks that have seen their price fall the most on the stock market this year is Gestamp. Its shares have fallen more than 30% since the beginning of the year. The capital is controlled by the Riberas family, who, through their family holding company, own 22%, while 51% does not float on the market. Francisco Riberas himself, in an interview to this media, acknowledged that they have even considered buying the remaining 27% and delisting it from the stock exchange. Despite the fact that it is not going through its best moment due to the increase in raw material and energy costs, they have maintained their medium-term objectives. Gestamp is also among those listed at the lowest P/E (times earnings per share price) in the Spanish stock market, at 7.6 times its 2022 results, and among those where analysts see the greatest upside potential for the next 12 months, at 65%. A similar case is that of Fluidra, which has suffered a 27% plunge in its shares this year that makes it trade at a discount compared to 2019 of more than 70% by PER. The pool manufacturer, moreover, has just regained the buy recommendation from the analysts' consensus collected by FactSet after it has kept its targets intact and raised its dividend for this year. In addition, its largest shareholder, RhÃ´ne Capital, has been gradually exiting the company's capital for some time, but it still has more than 11% that it could sell to another private equity fund.  Acerinox is another paradigmatic case, because although it should have been a winner in this environment of high commodity prices, the market is not recognizing it and it has fallen almost 15% this year, which leaves it trading at a derisory PER 4, the second lowest in the entire Spanish stock market behind only ArcelorMittal, which is beyond the reach, due to its size, of the investment funds' snail companies. The steel company offers almost 70% potential, according to analysts, and receives the best recommendation of the entire Ibex 35.  Catalana Occidente also trades cheaply, at a PER of only 7.5 times. A business that has always received very good recommendations from experts and which could now benefit from a context of rising interest rates. Its main shareholder is the Serra family, with more than 60%. While this family has not expressed its willingness to increase the company's liquidity, the LÃ³pez-Belmonte family has done so with respect to Rovi, in which they have a 55% stake (although they have already achieved their objective of entering the Ibex). The pharma currently trades at a discount of almost 80% compared to how it did in 2019, before the pandemic. Possible contacts Some companies have even already had, or have hinted at, some direct contacts with private equity. One example is Ence, which in November 2020 already sold 49% of its energy subsidiary to Ancala Partners and now it would not be unreasonable to think of another operation of this kind. Also Logista, whose CEO ÃÃ±igo MeirÃ¡s, in an interview to this media, could not deny that there had been no contacts with private funds, at a time when the market was not recognizing the value of the company he manages, to which analysts give a potential of almost 50%. In the case of Grifols, which also trades cheaply and with a potential of 50%, there have also been strong rumors in recent weeks that it was going to receive an offer from private equity, although for the moment it has remained just that. For Gabriel Escarrer, CEO of MeliÃ¡, it would not make sense to sell part of the family's majority stake to stay in the Ibex, but it would ""if it is to carry out a hyper-strategic project that adds value"". Other eligible companies would be Prosegur, because of its business, type of shareholding and price, and Sacyr, because it belongs to a sector in which private equity has been particularly active, such as concessions."
812,0,Australian mining billionaire files lawsuit against Facebook over scam ads,499 words,Reuters News,"The lawsuit filed by Forrest in the Magistrates Court of Western Australia alleges Facebook ""failed to create controls or a corporate culture to prevent its systems being used to commit crime."" It also alleges Facebook was criminally reckless by not taking sufficient steps to stop criminals from using its social media platform to send scam advertisements to defraud Australian users. The lawsuit comes after Forrest said he made several requests asking Facebook to prevent his image from being used to promote investment plans, including in an open letter to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg in November 2019.  Facebook, which changed its name to Meta last year, declined to comment on the lawsuit but said that in general it has always taken a ""multifaceted approach"" to stop such ads appearing and had blocked advertisers. ""We're committed to keeping these people off our platform,"" a spokesperson for Meta said in an emailed statement. Some advertisements, which have used Forrest's image and claimed to promote cryptocurrency investment schemes, have appeared on Facebook since March 2019, the lawsuit said. ""This action is being taken on behalf of those everyday Australians ï¿½?Mums and Dads, Grans and Grandads ï¿½?who work all their lives to gather their savings and to ensure those savings aren't swindled away by scammers,"" Forrest said in a statement.  Under Australian law, a private prosecution of a foreign corporation for alleged offences under the Commonwealth Criminal Code requires the consent of the country's attorney general.  ""The Attorney-General has given her consent to the private prosecution against Facebook in relation to alleged offences under subsection 400.7(2) of the Criminal Code,"" said Steven Lewis, principal of Mark O'Brien Legal, which will represent Forrest in the case.  The office of Attorney General Michaelia Cash did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. If Facebook is found guilty, it will face a maximum penalty of A$126,000 ($90,000) on each of three charges, Lewis said. An initial hearing has been set for March 28, Forrest said. In September last year, Forrest filed a separate civil case against Facebook in the Superior Court of California, County of San Mateo.  Facebook has been under pressure in Australia after disagreeing initially with a new law that required it and Google to pay for links to media companies' content.

68,1,Heard on the Street: Feeling the Burn Of Higher Gas Prices -- WSJ,564 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"Smokers have puffed their way through multiple hikes in the price of a pack of cigarettes over the past two years. What is happening at the gas pump may soon force them to cut back. The volume of cigarettes sold in the U.S. over the four weeks through March 26 fell 9.4% from the same period last year, data from Nielsen shows. This is a deterioration from February's already weak volumes, which slipped 7.9% year-over-year. Tobacco sales have been volatile throughout the pandemic but the cost of gas is probably having an impact, too. Historically, U.S. cigarette volumes have moved inversely to fuel prices. Drivers are currently paying $4.10 a gallon on average, according to GasBuddy data. Prices have come down from highs seen in March, but a gallon today is still roughly 40% more expensive than it was this time last year -- multiples of the 8.5% rate of overall inflation. Pricier gas has an outsize impact on demand for cigarettes. Smokers tend to have lower incomes, so fuel costs take up a greater share of their disposable spending. Smoking prevalence among people earning less than $35,000 a year is 21.4% compared with just 7.1% for those earning more than $100,000. Cigarette sales are also sensitive to gasoline prices as the two are often purchased together. At least 60% of U.S. tobacco purchases are made in gas stations according to Vivien Azer, an analyst at Cowen. Higher prices at the pump discourage impulse spending in gas station convenience stores. Pinched smokers are already trading down. The cheapest cigarette brands took 1.4 percentage points of market share from more expensive tobacco like Marlboro in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with a year earlier, based on Cowen data. Recent price increases by big tobacco firms may accelerate the trend. British American Tobacco, which makes Lucky Strike cigarettes, and Marlboro manufacturer Altria have increased prices eight and seven times, respectively, over the past two years, UBS notes. Historically, the two companies have raised prices around twice annually. Big tobacco companies are probably willing to sacrifice some market share in old-school smokes to maximize their profits. Cigarette companies are pouring billions of dollars into noncombustible products such as heated tobacco sticks and vape pens. This shift to so-called reduced risk products must be funded by their highly lucrative legacy business. Higher gas prices make it trickier to squeeze smokers for more cash to fund innovation without losing them to cheaper rivals. Tobacco stocks are performing well regardless. BAT is up almost one fifth this year, while Altria has gained 16%. Even after the rally, their dividend yields are 7% -- more than quadruple the S&P 500 average. Generous payouts and the perceived defensive nature of tobacco stocks will remain a big lure, but investors should keep one eye on prices at the pump.

23,0,"Insurer Axa to pay Â£4.4m to Corbin & King for Covid losses, court rules",226 words,City AM,"The Supreme Court said Axa must pay Â£4.4m to the high end restauranter, after ruling the firm was covered under a business interruption policy for losses it suffered due to lockdown. The ruling came after Corbin & King - which owns eight restaurants across the UK including Colbert in Sloane Square and The Wolseley in Mayfair - was plunged into administration in February after suffering heavy losses during the pandemic.  Axa's decision not to appeal the ruling could open it and other insurers to further claims from other hospitality businesses that suffered losses during the pandemic. The insurer's decision came as hospitality giant Minor International last week launched a successful takeover of Corbin & King through an auction organized by the firm's administrators. The auction saw the Thai firm beat out company co-founder Jeremy King in buying up the restaurateur for Â£60m."
746,0,Hunter Biden laptop findings renew scrutiny of social media crackdowns,720 words,The Washington Post,"The actions ushered in a wave of backlash from Republicans, who accused technology platforms of suppressing the material to shield Biden, that continues to fuel attacks on Silicon Valley. Amid new reporting by The Washington Post, verifying the authenticity of thousands of emails purportedly from the laptop of Hunter Biden, and the New York Times, which authenticated some messages in the cache, the social media giants are facing fresh scrutiny. On Wednesday, my colleagues Craig Timberg, Matt Viser and Tom Hamburger wrote that ""thousands of emails purportedly from the laptop computer of Hunter Biden"" are ""authentic communications that can be verified through cryptographic signatures from Google and other technology companies,"" based on an analysis two security experts conducted for The Post. According to the report, ""neither expert reported finding evidence that individual emails or other files had been manipulated by hackers, but neither was able to rule out that possibility."" Republicans have seized on the laptop as proof of wrongdoing, while Democrats have suggested it could have been manipulated to include foreign misinformation. Ultimately, my colleagues wrote, the forensic analysis is ""unlikely to resolve that debate,"" given that the verdict on much of the purported laptop data remains inconclusive. But the findings highlight the fact that technology companies appear to have acted both forcefully and preemptively against a perceived threat that to this day has not been publicly corroborated. Twitter and Facebook declined to comment on the new findings. The findings are also resurfacing broader debates within civil society about where social media obligations to curtail suspected misinformation begin and end. A crucial question is what role, if any, should they play in restricting articles by prominent news outlets, particularly when dealing with unverified or dubious sourcing? ""A company like Twitter should not be trying to make a determination on the veracity of information when it is impossible for them to have the type of information they would need to do so,"" Evan Greer, director of digital activist group Fight for the Future, told The Technology 202. Looming over Twitter and Facebook in 2020 were widespread fears of repeating the events of 2016, when Russian hackers leaked troves of emails from Democratic officials. Former Facebook security chief Alex Stamos told my colleague Will Oremus that, in retrospect, the platforms ""overreacted"" against the New York Post coverage of Hunter Biden, but he understood why. The ""most effective Russian operation"" in 2016 was the leak of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee, and ""this smelled like the exact same playbook,"" he said Wednesday. Stamos said the companies were in a ""no win situation,"" likely facing allegations of censorship if they limited the article or criticism of amplifying potential misinformation if they let it spread. A slew of former intelligence officials expressed skepticism at the time about the veracity of the New York Post article and warned it could be Russian disinformation.  Twitter, which took more aggressive action, took the brunt of the heat in Washington. While the company reversed its initial ruling that the article violated its policies against hacked materials, it continued to block users from posting it under a separate rule against publishing private user information.  Twitter later changed course again, saying it would allow users to share the link because the information was widely available in publications beyond the New York Post. Ultimately, the episode underscores the risks social media platforms take when deciding whether to limit content where the risk of harm is unclear. ""This latest analysis shows how complex and difficult it can be to verify the authenticity of documents or digital files, regardless of how they have been obtained,"" Greer said. ""That is true whether material was allegedly hacked or just given to a journalist by a willing source."""
848,0,Neil Young Demands Spotify Remove His Music Over Joe Rogan's Vaccine Comments; Singer says Spotify 'is spreading fake information about vaccinesâpotentially causing death',944 words,The Wall Street Journal Online,"Mr. Young didn't respond to requests for comment. The letter came in response to ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast, which is currently Spotify's most popular podcast[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/spotify-adds-subscribers-as-covid-19-boosts-at-home-streaming-11619604000] and also topped Apple's podcasting charts. In 2020, Mr. Rogan signed an exclusive podcasting deal with Spotify[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/spotify-strikes-exclusive-podcast-deal-with-joe-rogan-11589913814], worth more than $100 million, according to people familiar with the matter. ""With an estimated 11 million listeners per episode, JRE, which is hosted exclusively on Spotify, is the world's largest podcast and has tremendous influence. Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform,"" Mr. Young wrote in the letter. ""I want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platformâ¦They can have Rogan or Young. Not both."" While Mr. Young's label, Warner Music Group Corp.'s Warner Records, is the licensor to Spotify and may legally have control over how and where his music is distributed, it is typical for a record company to take an artist's wishes into account. An act of Mr. Young's cachet in particular tends to have more control over their career and creative output. If a decision is reached to remove the music, Spotify could take it down in a matter of hours, according to people familiar with the matter. Streaming accounts for 84% of recorded music revenue in the U.S., according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Spotify is by far the largest music-streaming service by paid subscriptions. Mr. Young's letter cited an episode of the podcast in which Mr. Rogan spoke with Dr. Robert Malone, a virologist who worked on research into several mRNA Covid-19 vaccines but who is now critical of the treatments. Among the claims made was the suggestion that hospitals have been financially motivated to falsely diagnose deaths as having been caused by Covid-19. Mr. Rogan has regularly used his podcast to discuss Covid-19 vaccines and restrictions, railing against vaccine mandates for indoor events and suggesting that young, healthy people shouldn't be vaccinated. Spotify's bet on Mr. Rogan's show has caused trouble in the past for the audiostreaming company. Some employees expressed concern over the podcast's content[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/joe-rogans-podcast-sparks-tensions-inside-spotify-11604156400] during a town-hall meeting in September 2020, relating to material they felt was anti-transgender, according to people familiar with the matter. The company stood by its star podcaster, with Chief Executive Daniel Ek saying that the ambition to make Spotify the ""largest audio platform in the world"" involves embracing diverse voices and differing opinions as the company chases scale in podcasting. ""The most important thing for us is to have very clear policies in place,"" he said in an interview a month after the town hall. ""It doesn't matter if you're Joe Rogan or anyone else, we do apply those policies and they need to be evenly applied."" Earlier this month, a group of 270 scientists and healthcare professionals signed an open letter[https://spotifyopenletter-wordpress-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/2022/01/10/an-open-letter-to-spotify/] to Spotify accusing the podcast of ""promoting baseless conspiracy theories"" and asking the service to take action against mass-misinformation events on its platform. ""Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Joe Rogan has repeatedly spread misleading and false claims on his podcast, provoking distrust in science and medicine,"" it said. Since the start of the pandemic, Spotify has removed over 20,000 Covid-related podcast episodes as a result of creators violating its policies, according to a person familiar with the matter. While more than 40 of Mr. Rogan's episodes have been removed, none of them have been related to the pandemic, this person said. Mr. Young also launched his own streaming service[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/neil-young-launches-subscription-streaming-service-11545343348] in 2018 called the ""Neil Young Archives,"" which offers different yearly subscriptions ranging from $19.99 to $99.99 to access the artist's albums. Mr. Young has previously had issues with streaming platforms. In 2015, he said he didn't need his content ""to be devalued by the worst quality in the history of broadcasting or any other form of distribution"" and that he was pulling his music[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/BL-SEB-89989] from streaming services. The artist's music returned to Spotify in 2016. ""That's where people get music,"" he later told Rolling Stone. Monday's letter wasn't the first time the outspoken 76-year-old has used his website to take on big companies in the music business. Last summer, Mr. Young criticized concert promoters in a post, calling live shows super-spreader events[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/concert-plans-change-as-covid-19-concerns-persist-11630143001] and wondering why more artists weren't canceling shows. âAllison Prang contributed to this article.

423,0,Sweden to lift pandemic restrictions next week,295 words,Reuters News,"""It's time to open Sweden up again,"" Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told a news conference. ""Looking ahead, infection rates will remain high for a while longer, but as far as we can judge, the worst consequences of the contagion are now behind us,"" she said. Fuelled by the more contagious Omicron variant, Sweden has repeatedly set newly daily case records over the past month that has strained the healthcare system, although to a lesser extent than in previous waves. Sweden stood out early in the pandemic by spurning lockdowns, mainly relying on voluntary measures focused on social distancing and good hygiene, though somewhat tighter restrictions were gradually adopted in successive waves. It has seen deaths per capita run much higher than in its Nordic neighbours but lower than most European countries that opted for lockdowns. Some recommendations, such as getting vaccinated and isolating at home when sick, will remain in place and they will be more restrictive for the unvaccinated, Health Minister Lena Hallengren told the news conference. Amid increasing evidence that Omicron results in less severe disease than previous variants, she added the Health Agency will also propose that the virus no longer be designated a threat to society, though it would still be closely monitored.

961,1,Volkswagen sees impact of Ukraine war despite profit bounce,328 words,Agence France Presse,"The boost was down to strong ""operating performance"" and a positive effect of 3.5 billion euros thanks to hedges against the changing price of raw materials. The turbulence on commodities markets could be traced back to the ""ongoing war in Ukraine"", which has pushed up prices, Volkswagen said in a statement. Supply chain impacts could also be seen, with deliveries from suppliers in Ukraine being limited. The lack of critical car parts has already forced Volkswagen, along with other German carmakers, to curtail production at some plants, while exports to Russia have been halted. The course of the war and the impact on Volkswagen ""cannot be predicted with sufficient certainty"" but risked having a ""negative impact"" on the Wolfsburg-based group.  Volkswagen also said it delivered some 500,000 fewer cars in the first quarter of 2022 than in the previous year, a 22-percent drop. The continued impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has recently led to widespread lockdowns in China, a key market, also loomed over the auto manufacturer's future performance. As did the possibility of further disruption to supply chains ""especially for semiconductors"", a key component in both conventional and electric vehicles. The two effects already conspired to make business difficult for Volkswagen in 2021. Despite net profits rising by 75 percent to 15.4 billion euros, the 12-brand group delivered 600,000 fewer units last year, as lockdowns and shortages caused interruptions in production. sea/mfp/rl"
226,0,Ultra-rich Russians desert ski capital,826 words,The Times,"Filippo Casaccia, coowner of the Ski 5 Star school, said instructors had seen cancellations from ""very important guys from Russia"". He said he believes they have cancelled because they are ""at risk if [they are] here and also afraid of being spotted here"". While the few who remained quaffed bottles of aprÃ¨s-ski champagne as their compatriots engaged in war this week, locals estimated that the number of Russians was down by 90 per cent. Gosia, 44, a regular from Poland, said that she had been surprised. ""Two weeks ago there were hundreds here and right now they have disappeared they have escaped,"" she said. She described being infuriated after watching some Russian guests continuing to party at Le Tremplin, a restaurant where jeroboams of wine cost up to ï¿½?0,000. ""Those who are travelling are absolutely aware of what is happening. They are taking advantage and it really inappropriate for them to be here,"" she said. While many Russians who did stay kept a low profile, the wife of one oligarch was not cowed. Ilona Kotelyukh, whose billionaire husband Nikolai Sarkisov is the coowner of Reso-Garantia, one of Russia's biggest insurance firms, beamed while posing in designer ski gear this week. The social media influencer lashed out at critics of her stay at the resort, which she called ""my oasis"", pointing out that their children had been ill and griping about the journey to Geneva. Kotelyukh, 29, complained about Russian and Belarusian athletes being banned from the Winter Paralympics. She directly addressed the situation in Ukraine, calling the family ""ordinary people"" who do not want war and questioning why she had been subjected to threats. She wrote: ""While some people think we are having a good time in Courchevel, my children have been ill the whole week. [My son] has a temperature ... I'm running around. Geneva is a two-and-a-half-hour journey there and back."" The mother of two, who said she had relatives in Ukraine, added: ""We all love our life and our lands. We love our Russian, Armenia[n], Ukrainian, Polish and Belarusian people. We will never partition anyone. And my children will grow up with this position."" Images online last week showed the Russian and Ukrainian flags being waved as partygoers danced and were offered champagne at Bagatelle, a high-end restaurant. The images were captured by the Russiabased hotelier Inna Alexandrovna, who noted that she is half-Ukrainian. Alexandrovna captured herself dancing on tables with friends, quaffing wine and eating at expensive restaurants. The situation is a dramatic departure for the resort, which garnered the nickname ""Courchevelski"" for its popularity with bigspending Russians, whose language adorns the menus at many of its fivestar hotels. Within 48 hours of the Ukraine invasion, staff described Russians frantically trying to go home on the private jets and helicopters that service the resort's mountain airport. A hotel employee told The Times that six Russian groups were due to check in on Monday but only two showed up. Courchevel began to attract post-perestroika Russians in the 1990s, led by Roman Abramovich, who would buy Chelsea Football Club in 2003. The ensuing influx continued the resort's evolution into a byword for luxury now with eight Michelin-starred restaurants and three of France's 25 distinguished ""palace"" hotels. The centre of the resort, Courchevel 1850, is lined with designer stores such as Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Balenciaga, as well as art galleries, diamond sellers and fur boutiques. Jean-Yves Pachod, the mayor, would not discuss the future of Russian tourism in the resort, citing the situation as too ""complex"". There is speculation about the future of the so-called ""super chalets"" in the resort owned by wealthy Russians after the French authorities vowed this week to seize assets linked to the Kremlin. Last year a company linked to Sarkisov, 53, paid ï¿½?4 million for a chalet with a pool, gym and private cinema. The businessman of Armenian descent who was listed 1,465th on Forbes's 2014 billionaires list previously coconstructed another chalet for ï¿½?4 million. The drop-off in visitors is partially explained by the travel ban on Russian flights enforced in Europe as the invasion began, as well as the EU's refusal to accept the Sputnik Covid-19 vaccine. Locals, however, point out that many of the Russian guests are based in Europe, travelling to the resort from homes in London, Paris and Monaco."

682,0,Brazil's Bolsonaro turns to Telegram as vote nears,736 words,Agence France Presse,"Bolsonaro, who has had various posts blocked on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for violating their rules on misinformation, is eagerly encouraging his base to follow him on Telegram as the vote nears. Founded by Russian-born tech entrepreneur Pavel Durov in 2013, Telegram is a crypted messaging app with virtually no restrictions on what users can say in messages. That has won it fans in Bolsonaro's camp, where other social media companies face accusations of censoring right-wing views. It has also earned it scrutiny from the Brazilian authorities, notably the Superior Electoral Tribunal, which has tried in vain to get Telegram to cooperate in fighting disinformation in the run-up to the elections. ""Here, you can express your opinions freely,"" said @mara, a 60-year-old teacher who asked her real name not be used. The pressure on Telegram, she said, is ""RI-DI-CU-LOUS."" ""That's a DICTATORSHIP, it only happens in countries governed by dictators,"" she told AFP via the app, which has been hugely successful in Brazil, downloaded on 53 percent of all cell phones. Bolsonaro is facing an uphill battle to win reelection, currently trailing leftist ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in polls. Like his political role model, former US president Donald Trump, Bolsonaro is adept at rallying his base on social media, where the Brazilian leader has more than 45 million followers in all. He faces a series of investigations for spreading false information on social networks, notably over his repeated claims of rampant fraud in Brazil's electronic voting system, for which he has provided no evidence. Bolsonaro has more than one million followers on Telegram, not including numerous fan groups with names like ""Reelect Bolsonaro 2022."" Lula, for his part, has just 47,000. Dubai-based Telegram proudly explains on its website that its chat data and encryption keys are deliberately spread around the world, in what is known as ""distributed infrastructure."" ""Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of expression,"" it says. Its refusal to block content some consider dangerous has sometimes gotten it in trouble, including suspensions in several countries. And its largely unmoderated platform, which allows groups of up to 200,000 members, is a potential viral breeding ground for false information. Earlier this month, the Superior Electoral Tribunal signed an agreement with eight leading social networks to combat disinformation during the elections, including Twitter, TikTok, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and YouTube. Telegram was notably absent. The court's president, Luis Roberto Barroso, wrote to Telegram headquarters in December, asking for a meeting and warning that the app was rife with ""conspiracy theories and false information about (Brazil's) electoral system."" He went on to threaten Brazil would suspend Telegram, ""plain and simple."" Bolsonaro said any such move would be ""cowardly."" Brazilian prosecutors are also investigating Telegram on allegations of spreading disinformation and hate speech. ""It's a platform designed to dodge the law. Messages are stored on multiple servers, each in a different jurisdiction,"" said Pablo Ortellado, a digital communications expert at the University of Sao Paulo. Bolsonaro's repeated allegations against the electronic voting system used in Brazil since 1996 are raising fears he will reject the election result if he loses, like Trump. The specter of the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters -- who were riled up in part on social media -- looms large in Brazil. ""The fear is that if Telegram can't be brought under Brazilian electoral legislation, false allegations of vote fraud can't be regulated or contained,"" Ortellado told AFP. If Brazil does block Telegram, @mara has a back-up plan: she has already signed up for other apps, including Trump's new Truth Social, which started rolling out Sunday. ""WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP,"" she said. jm/jhb/mlm"
997,1,Agricultural start-ups need long-term business strategies: experts,400 words,Vietnam News Summary,"But the use of technology remains limited since it is still relatively new in Vietnam and many farmers are still used to traditional methods, she said. The country has a diverse range of agricultural products, but does not have a consumer market based on actual supply and demand, and farmers lower prices to sell their products and compete with rivals, she pointed out. âItâs difficult to build a brand for Vietnamese agricultural products because of low economic value,ï¿½?she said. âFarmers only pay attention to producing raw agricultural products instead of creating added value for the products.ï¿½?Most farming start-ups do not share information and business opportunities with each other, making it difficult to build agricultural markets, experts said at a panel discussion hi-tech agriculture start-ups in Ho Chi Minh City last week. Most do not clearly define the objectives for each stage of their business, they said. Most want to quickly sell out products instead of patiently marketing and branding them, but to be successful they need to build a long-term business strategy and strengthen linkages within the start-up eco-system, they pointed out. Many are household or individual businesses who do not have enough resources, making the linkages imperative, they said. They should not expect profits immediately like other commercial activities and services, need to have a thorough understanding of the market, culture and climate and should network with professionals in various fields to succeed, they added. The discussion is part of the Innovation Start-up Project Competition organized since 2012 by the HCM City Business Study and Assistance Center in collaboration with the Rural Youth Committee of Central Youth Union. The innovative agricultural start-up project has been supporting the countryâs start-up community for the last 10 years. It has organized more than 320 training classes, seminars and talks for more than 25,000 participants. (Viet Nam Plus ï¿½?April 13)"

373,0,"As Olympic torch is lit in hope, I see light at end of the tunnel",790 words,The Herald,"When Ivy League universities in America are closing their doors and sending students home until August, donât rule out the first cancellation of an Olympic Games since World War II.? The IOC and host nation Japan are still confident that the Games will go ahead as planned, but no one has any real idea on how long this might go on for. Just from athletes I have spoken to, there is definitely real concern over the Games. The concern isnât just over whether the games get cancelled or not. For each individual athlete, it is also over their own preparations. As an athlete, getting sick is never great and if you got this virus bad you might face missing weeks of training. It could result on you missing the podium in Tokyo.? Or missing the Games altogether. Another friend of mine told me of his concerns that if they move the Games then he might not even get selected.? With markets crashing and supermarket shelves being cleared, these are definitely interesting times for everybody. But when you are living during this Covid-19 pandemic with a spinal-cord injury I guess it becomes even more daunting ï¿½?as such an injury can remove your cough and sneeze reflex. With very little core function, the thought of not being able to cough is a pretty scary proposition.? This might not sound too bad. But this virus hits elderly people hard ï¿½?and this also includes your biological age due to underlying medical conditions. So this is a scary time, and I completely feel for everyone in the same boat as me how scary this is.?I remember back to catching the flu in November last year ï¿½?I thought I was going to stop breathing. I couldnât cough to clear my lungs as the level of my injury is right at the nerves which go to the lungs.? It knocked me out for weeks, so I would be lying if I said I wasnât slightly scared of Covid-19 and its possible effects on my lungs.? I am a very optimistic person who always looks for solutions over problems. But I must admit this has got me a little bit shaken.? Watching whatâs happening in Italy has been hard to believe ï¿½?particularly as life seemed to be continuing almost as normal here.? I looked at the MRI of a 44-year-old manâs lungs and it was unbelievable, unfortunately he didnât survive.? So I am staying positive but also taking advice from Austrian neurologist Viktor Frankl.?He speaks of acceptance of your current situation. These are his own words ï¿½?which I have had on my wall for the last four years: âThe meaning of life lies in finding a purpose and taking responsibility for ourselves and other human beings.ï¿½? In other words, by having a clear âwhyï¿½?we can face all the âhowï¿½?questions of life. This has got me through all those hours in hospital and continues to serve me daily.? Thereâs a reason that in-flight safety presentations always instruct us to secure our own oxygen masks before assisting fellow passengers. We canât help others effectively unless we first protect ourselves. So I spoke with a medical oncologist friend and they advised me to self-isolate.? I am now on day four and thinking this could be a long road ahead; thankfully the weather is getting warmer and I got out on my bike for a few laps of Richmond Park. Along with indoor turbo sessions I am well prepared mentally for the process. I guess all my time in hospital equipped my mind to deal with self-isolating. It also probably helps being an introvert.? I canât help but think of the poor people undergoing their cancer treatment right now though, as I prepare for my own hospital appointment in a few weeks, but I am grateful that side of things is under control. My main goal is keeping my immune system strong because another issue I have from my spinal-cord injury is a compromised immune system, thus moving me into a vulnerable group.? Itâs hard to go from a strong athlete to now feeling so vulnerable, but thankfully I have a strong mind."
589,1,Engineering - Materials Engineering; Findings from Lviv Polytechnic National University Provides New Data on Materials Engineering (Pnn-svm Approach of Ti-based Powder's Properties Evaluation for Biomedical Implants Production),478 words,Computer Weekly News,"Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Lviv Polytechnic National University, ""However, there are problems associated with assessing defects in the microstructure, mechanical and technological properties of alloys, both during their production by powder metallurgy and in the process of 3D printing. Thus traditional research methods of alloys properties demand considerable human, material, and time resources. At the same time, artificial intelligence tools create opportunities for intelligent evaluation of the conformity for the microstructure, phase composition, and properties of titanium powder's alloys. It provides new possibilities for the efficient production of biocompatible implants for various functional purposes. However, the accuracy of the methods and models used should be as high as possible. In this paper we designed a hybrid PNN-SVM (Probabilistic Neural Network-Support Vector Machine) high-precision approach for the intelligent evaluation of alloy properties for additive manufacturing of biomedical implants. We have proposed a new approach for extending the dimensionality of input data space by the outputs of the summation layer of the modified PNN topology. Subsequent classification based on the expanded dataset is performed using SVM. We conducted experimental modeling of the proposed approach using a data set on the properties of titanium alloys Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-Al-V-Zr.""

514,1,Inditex and ten more EuroStoxx payments to 'hedge' against the CPI,627 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"The textile company announced a dividend charged to 2021 of 0.93 euros gross per share to be paid in two payments, the first on May 2 (of 0.465 euros) and the second on November 2 (of another 0.465 euros, which includes the extraordinary payment of 0.30 euros). The novelty of all this is that it wanted to give guidance, in view of the fact that the extraordinary payment of 1 euro that it distributed between three financial years ends with this year's payment and next year's payment will amount to 0.40 euros. The consensus expects an annual dividend of 1.07 euros, with a yield of 5.3%, slightly above inflation. Automobiles and banks The EuroStoxx, which has just kicked off the great dividend season - with 37 payouts from the 50 companies up to June - brings together the most attractive payouts expected this year from automobile and financial firms. The dividend leader in Europe is Intesa San Paolo, which is launching a new strategic plan in which it has committed to maintaining a payout of 70% until 2025 and will approve a share buyback of 3.4 billion euros, or a maximum of 10% of its capitalization. The consensus expects a dividend of almost 9% in 2022 with a payout of ï¿½?.17 gross. The second most attractive dividend is that of Stellantis. The conglomerate formed by Fiat Chrysler and PSA will distribute next April 29 a dividend of 1.04 euros in its single annual payment charged to 2021 and the first (ordinary) in its history, which yields 7.5%. This is the first payment as a company in its own right, following the distribution of a special dividend of 32 cents last year and the distribution to its shareholders of its stake in Faurecia, the French automotive supplier. Looking ahead to 2022, the payout will increase to 1.14%, a return of 8.2%. In this alternation, third place goes to another bank, BNP Paribas, fourth place to automobiles, with Mercedes-Benz, and fifth place to ING. The French bank's dividend, excluding the share buyback, has a dividend of 7.2%, above 3.51 euros, according to estimates, although it could be higher considering that analysts have not yet taken into account the improvement in profits resulting from the rise in interest rates in the eurozone.  Mercedes-Benz will pay a dividend of 5 euros on May 4, which yields 8%, charged to 2021, thanks to an extraordinary profit before the spin-off of Daimler's trucks. That implies lower forecasts for 2022. A payout of ï¿½?.37 is expected, with an expected yield of 7%."
698,0,Boomers Should Fight for Change,1364 words,The New York Times,"We've seen this close up: Over the past few months, we've worked with others of our generation to start the group Third Act, which organizes people over the age of 60 for progressive change. That's no easy task. The baby boomers and the Silent Generation before them make up a huge share of the population -- nearly 75 million people, a larger population than France's. And conventional wisdom (and a certain amount of data) holds that people become more conservative as they age, perhaps because they have more to protect. But as those musicians reminded us, these are no normal generations. We're both in our 60s; in the 1960s and '70s, our generation either bore witness to or participated in truly profound cultural, social and political transformations. Think of Neil Young singing ''four dead in Ohio'' in the weeks after Kent State or Joni Mitchell singing ''they paved paradise'' after the first Earth Day. Perhaps we thought we'd won those fights. But now we emerge into older age with skills, resources, grandchildren -- and a growing fear that we're about to leave the world a worse place than we found it. So some of us are more than ready to turn things around. It's not that there aren't plenty of older Americans involved in the business of politics: We've perhaps never had more aged people in positions of power, with most of the highest offices in the nation occupied by septuagenarians and up, yet even with all their skills, they can't get anything done because of the country's political divisions. But the daily business of politics -- the inside game -- is very different from the sort of political movements that helped change the world in the '60s. Those we traditionally leave to the young, and indeed at the moment it's young people who are making most of the difference, from the new civil rights movement exemplified by Black Lives Matter to the teenage ranks of the climate strikers. But we can't assign tasks this large to high school students as extra homework; that's neither fair nor practical. Instead, we need older people returning to the movement politics they helped invent. It's true that the effort to embarrass Spotify over its contributions to the stupidification of our body politic hasn't managed yet to make it change its policies yet. But the users of that streaming service skew young: Slightly more than half are below the age of 35, and just under a fifth are 55 or older. Other important pressure points may play out differently. One of Third Act's first campaigns, for instance, aims to take on the biggest banks in America for their continued funding of the fossil fuel industry even as the global temperature keeps climbing. Chase, Citi, Bank of America and Wells Fargo might want to take note, because (fairly or not) 70 percent of the country's financial assets are in the hands of boomers and the Silent Generation, compared to just about 5 percent for millennials. Awakened older Americans could push hard on these banks. Not every older person is financially comfortable -- which puts the onus on those of us who are -- but we've heard from thousands of people who do not want their life savings used to undermine the life chances of their children. Or think about the equally crucial fight to protect democracy. Older Americans vote in huge numbers; they were 44 percent of the electorate in 2020, with boomers closely divided on their presidential choice and those over 75 clearly favoring Donald Trump. Many older Americans still tended to support the candidates and party backing voter suppression -- but Joe Biden narrowed those margins. Older Americans must be reminded that we witnessed the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, perhaps the most American thing that Congress has done in our lifetime. That's why we're assembling what we call a Democracy Force of older volunteers to make the phone calls and write the letters to potential voters around the country (and yes, it's worth remembering that older Americans have more time at their disposal). Reminding one another of the early years of our lives is, we think, key. If our first act was pretty fascinating, the second act for too many of our generations focused harder on consumerism than on citizenship; we drifted into an individualism that fit easily with the Reagan ethos of looking out for oneself. But if it worked for us, it clearly isn't working for the planet or the society as a whole -- younger people realized that, which is why they took up the ''OK, boomer,'' cry, and we've begun to realize it too. Older voters began drifting back to Mr. Biden in the last election, but we think that drift needs to grow into a wave if we're going to defuse the challenges facing us. And it can. Plenty of people don't take older Americans seriously as political actors. If you read Twitter in the wake of the Spotify kerfuffle, there were lots of comments about ''has-been artists'' and ''geezers.'' We prefer ''experienced Americans,'' but if you want to talk about codger power, then so be it (and by the way, don't dis our music -- people on music services are mostly streaming old tunes). Since we've begun organizing Third Act, it's been amazing to watch people come in out of the cold to help, people like Sam Brown, who in 1969 helped organize the vast Vietnam Moratorium Day, which drew millions into the streets, and now is helping run the campaign challenging banks on climate change. ''Back then those vast demonstrations started with just a few people,'' he said at our national virtual teach-in last month. ''We've just got to believe we can do what we need to do -- and if we believe it enough, we probably can.'' What really should scare the corporate and political bad actors is the prospect of old and young people connecting, because there is real power if we work across generations. Last fall, young activists called for demonstrations outside the fossil-friendly big banks, and they invited us to join in. We did, with a certain amount of gallows humor (''Fossils against fossil fuels'' read one banner in Boston). And by the end of this week, younger artists were joining in the Spotify boycott. The soul singer India Arie and the podcaster Roxane Gay, both 40-somethings, had pulled their work, too. This particular dust-up won't be a decisive battle in the struggle for a better America and a better planet; in fact, there may not be any decisive battles, just a long series of skirmishes that must be engaged by the young but also by the old. We may be nearer the exit than the entrance, but we're in this fight for the long haul.  Bill McKibben, the founder of the new progressive group Third Act, also helped found the climate advocacy group 350.org and is the author of the forthcoming book ''The Flag, the Cross, and the Station Wagon: A Graying American Looks Back at His Suburban Boyhood and Wonders What the Hell Happened.'' Akaya Windwood is the lead adviser of Third Act and a co-author of the forthcoming book ''Leading With Joy.'' The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

In his statement, Ek vowed that Spotify would affix warnings on podcast episodes that include conversations about COVID-19. Notably, Ek did not specify any content creators by name in the statement. Rogan then came forward with a 10-minute video posted to his Instagram in which he said, ""I'm not trying to promote misinformation."" Rogan admitted that it's important he ""makes sure that I've researched these topics -- the controversial ones in particular -- and have all the pertinent facts at hand before I discuss them,"" adding, ""I'm not trying to be controversial.

778,1,The retirement of the patriarch of the family business,886 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"Research shows that when the owner or owners of a company are faced with the prospect of succession, they face certain concerns, which we have called ""The Fears of the Patriarch"". These concerns present themselves with different strength and in different forms, depending on the type of company and the character of the founders at the helm of the company. 1. What to do after retirement; this can affect the founder(s) intensely. 2. 2. The fear of losing control of the company, thus reducing its economic security. 3. 3. The sacrifice of seeing their social status diminished as a consequence of giving up control of the company. 4. Insecurity about the appropriate profile of possible successors. 5. The fear that the choice of successor will generate conflicts within the family or with the partners. There are some other fears and uncertainties, but the five mentioned above are the ones most frequently found in the surveys applied to family businesses. The first three have to do with the patriarch and the next two with the profile of successors and intra-family relationships. I will refer to the first ones. Surveys have found a very interesting paradox. When managers over 55 years of age who ""plan to retire"" were interviewed, 80% said they would retire within 10 years, but 10 years go by and the vast majority do not retire. And it is precisely these fears that postpone retirement, and in some cases prevent it from taking place, with serious risks for the company and the family. It is true that there are some founders and foundresses who enjoy their retirement very much and find a ""new plenitude"". Some retain some non-executive tasks in the company, but leave the daily concerns to their successors and develop a new vocation in life that generates satisfaction. Unfortunately, this is the minority. The practice of several family businesses teaches us that it is possible to resolve the fears of the patriarch, matriarch, or patriarchs. The concern of what to do after retirement burdens more than 50% of the founders. They ask themselves ""what is the point of my job now?"" and do not always find the answer. One entrepreneur confessed ""leaving management was like having an amputation"" . In addition, the patriarch's fear of seeing his security reduced by losing economic control of the company is present not only in small companies but also in large companies where the owners are wealthy. It is probably more of a psychological than a strictly financial issue, but it can ""make noise"" at the time of succession. It helps a lot to achieve a successful succession to foresee an adequate package for the patriarch or matriarch, which may include, among others, financial benefits, medical insurance, travel support, etcetera. The fear of losing social status can be very strong ""now I am Don JosÃ© and I am greeted with respect, when I leave the leadership I will be a ""nobody"", ""I can lose the place I have"", ""I can lose the place I have in the family"", ""I can lose my position in the family"", etc. I may lose the place I have in the family, they will no longer look for me"". With a little creativity it is easy to solve this problem, for example, the general director of a chain of automotive distributors chose to remain as honorary president, he attends the international meetings of the brands, greets his friends, retains a representative role. He is satisfied: ""I keep a bit of the spotlight and my friends, but not the operational responsibility; I am better off. Several measures help to achieve a successful retirement. It is very helpful to find an attractive, dignified, and socially relevant occupation for the retiring founder. There are many examples of founders who have found a socially useful task, such as the BajÃ­o businessman who decided to found a university when he retired, or the businessman who started a social foundation that keeps him busy and very satisfied, or the businessman from the North who decided to participate in the politics of his home state. Therefore, the patriarch's retirement must be planned with creativity, with anticipation, with generosity, and giving it strategic priority.

686,1,Looking Into Marathon Petroleum's Return On Capital Employed,339 words,Benzinga.com,"Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q4, Marathon Petroleum posted an ROCE of 0.03%. Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future. ROCE is a powerful metric for comparing the effectiveness of capital allocation for similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Marathon Petroleum is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and, ultimately, earnings per share (EPS) growth. For Marathon Petroleum, the positive return on capital employed ratio of 0.03% suggests that management is allocating their capital effectively. Effective capital allocation is a positive indicator that a company will achieve more durable success and favorable long-term returns. Analyst Predictions  Marathon Petroleum reported Q4 earnings per share at $1.3/share, which beat analyst predictions of $0.55/share.

25,1,"Haldiram Planning A Mega IPO In Next 2-3 Years; Will Open More Dine-In Restaurants, Outlets Across India",504 words,Trak.in,"Haldiram To Launch IPO Within Next Two Or Three Years The chairman of Haldiram was talking during an exclusive interview where he also discussed the company's expansion plans, price hike, and a potential entry into Dalal Street. Haldiram is an 80-year-old snack brand which started off as a small shop in Bikaner and went on to become $1 billion company. While talking about the IPO Agarwal said, ""Due to soaring inflation, almost everything is costlier - from transportation and fuel to raw materials. The cost of edible oil is almost double now, but we have managed to hike prices only by 10-20 percent."" He also said that inflation is reaching new levels every day and therefore there are not much options left for the company than to increase prices further. Haldiram offers more than 70 sweet and salty snack products along with a presence in Delhi and Nagpur. The company is FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) products are already present in international markets. Agrawal also stated the company's plans to expand on the retail front with restaurants. This will encourage customers to visit restaurants and eat freshly prepared food. Haldiram already has 100 restaurants in Delhi and 30-40 in Nagpur. The company plans to expand retail outlets in India and then grow the business by taking it overseas in global markets. Haldiram Makes More Money Than McDonalds and Dominos? It was in 2015 when we reported that Haldiram's revenue is Rs.3900 cr which is more than the sum revenue of Domino's (ie Rs. 1733 cr) and MacDonald's (ie. 1390 cr). As Haldiram's was set up in 1937 by Gangabisenji Agrawal, the brand has been there in the market since the time we had Britishers snacking on it. The wide variety of foods available ranges from bhel, bhujia, sev, ice cream, sweets, sherbet, to namkeens etc. Indian snacks seem to have garnered a lot of appreciation and the sales, many say are triggered by the non-Indians in foreign lands. The brand is very old and like wine, it seems to have gotten better even after the family disputes. The snack chain has many direct outlets across India and if one notices, Haldiram's has stopped advertising. The Word of mouth publicity has always been their goodwill bearer for the veteran snacks maker. The branded Indian snacks segment just comprises of 15% and the majority of that 15% is captured by Haldiram's. However the foreign players like Frito Lay, Kurkure have a decent share in that 15% but both combined can't beat Haldiram's."

625,0,Putin propaganda channel Russia Today WILL disappear from British TV screens as government moves to shut down satellite that beams Kremlin lies into UK homes and YouTube blocks it online,603 words,Mail Online,"* Social media platform Facebook has also blocked access to RT and Sputnik * Comes after the video-sharing website YouTube blocked channels linked to RT Russian state-owned media outlet RT will no longer be available on Sky as the government moves to shut down the satellite that broadcasts 'Putin propaganda', the culture secretary has said. Nadine Dorries said the move would make RT 'severely restricted' in Britain, with the news channel set to disappear from Sky TV in the UK within the next 24 hours. It comes as media regulator Ofcom yesterday began 15 investigations into the 'due impartiality' of the Russian broadcaster, formerly known as Russia Today. It is understood the investigations mainly centre on reporting from correspondents on the ground - in places like the Donbas region of Ukraine - rather than the handling of stories by presenters in the studio. The move, which increases the likelihood of RT losing its UK licence, relates to 15 editions of its hourly news show aired on Sunday. RT, which has a number of British presenters and reporters, has reportedly referred to the invasion of Ukraine as a 'special military operation'. Meanwhile, the video-sharing website YouTube blocked channels linked to RT and Sputnik across Europe, including the UK. The Google-owned platform said the ban was effective immediately though it may take some time for the block to become fully effective. In a tweet, Ms Dorries said: 'Shortly, the French satellite which broadcasts Russia Today (RT) in both the EU and UK will be switched off. 'This means RT will no longer be available via Sky. 'Putin's polluting propaganda machine will now have severely restricted access into British homes via our TV screens.' The technology giant had previously limited the ability for RT and other Russian channels to make money from advertisements that appear on videos but has extended its sanctions. 'Due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we're blocking YouTube channels connected to RT and Sputnik across Europe, effective immediately,' a statement from Google Europe said. 'It'll take time for our systems to fully ramp up. Our teams continue to monitor the situation around the clock to take swift action.' Fellow social media platform Facebook has also blocked access to RT and Sputnik on its platform having previously also limited those channels' ability to make advertising revenue. The change means the pages of the organisations are not visible on Facebook or Instagram in the EU, but for now, they remain visible in the UK. Former UK deputy prime minister, Sir Nick Clegg, who is now vice president of global affairs at Facebook's parent company, Meta, said the firm had been asked by governments to take further action against Russian state-backed media. 'We have received requests from a number of Governments and the EU to take further steps in relation to Russian state-controlled media,' he said on Twitter on Monday night. 'Given the exceptional nature of the current situation, we will be restricting access to RT and Sputnik across the EU at this time.' On Sunday, Boris Johnson said the channel had been 'peddling' content that was 'doing a lot of damage to the truth', and called for Ofcom to look at whether it was 'infringing the rules of this country'."
33,0,"Michelin-starred restaurant is a stunner; This is not just confident cooking, it is also extremely clever and delicious",765 words,The Irish Times,"It is also likely that the experience that he and his wife Clairemarie Thomas both gained during their time in London - FitzGerald in Arbutus, St John, and then his appointment as head chef in Michelin-starred Harwood Arms, before returning home as the opening chef at Etto - is finally paying off. The ï¿½?0 tasting menu at Bastible could be described as a four-courser with snacks and petit four, but this might lead you to expect a few artfully displayed mouthfuls on expensive plates. Not so. Bring your appetite, and indeed your vegetarian friends, as the vegetarian menu here is quite exceptional. As is the wine list, although you may find the prices a bit scary. There's not much below ï¿½?0, but when you consider that the list includes many of the world's top young producers, it is worth asking the advice of Shane Lyons, the sommelier and manager. He suggests a Chardonnay from Judith Beck (ï¿½?4), a stunning biodynamic wine that is an incredibly good match with our dishes. Dried carrots do not sound like the most exciting way to start a vegetarian menu, but when they are sitting on a puree of ricotta dusted with crispy pumpkin seeds it is a different matter. The carrots are slightly chewy and sweet, and oh so delicious; and so too is the non-veggie snack of a Kelly's oyster dotted with smoky Morita chilli which adds a spicy kick to the juices. Beef tartare follows on one side of the table, beetroot on the other, kissed with lovage with its grassy anise notes and a crunchy confit potato. Baby leeks with pickled Galway mussels are spectacular. It is a dish that allows the ingredients to shine, while the flavours build in a dazzling sauce made from reduced buttermilk whey and I suspect quite a bit of butter and white wine. The vegetarian version is equally good, with pickled shimeji mushrooms. The fish course is like an Irish blinis and caviar interpretation - a buttermilk crumpet that is waiting to be piled up with smoked yoghurt, trout roe, fermented gooseberry and smoked trout that is falling apart under a lacquered apple reduction. It is clever and razor sharp with the addition of the gooseberries, and it is something that you eat with your hands rather than a knife and fork. For the vegetarian menu, it is Knockalara cheese dumplings, with wilted spring cabbage, doused in a Coolea cheese sauce with a few drops of chamomile oil. Hen of the woods, a meaty mushroom, wins the next round for the vegetarian menu, beating the slow-cooked Black Angus featherblade, which feels just a bit too wintery. But both pack a load of savoury flavour, with poached salsify, pureed Jerusalem artichoke, pine vinegar and crispy artichoke crumb scattered on top. Dessert is clever; a savoury/sweet tension, and the fact that ceps are involved in the chocolate ganache could go unnoticed except for the subtle hum of mushroom, balanced with Velvet Cloud sheep's milk ice cream, Pedro XimÃ©nez sauce and a crunch of buckwheat. Brown butter cake soaked in whiskey syrup and topped with smoked cream, like an Irish version of madeleines, is the perfect finish to the meal. This is not just confident cooking, it is also extremely clever and delicious. FitzGerald spares us the literal interpretation of how using a bastible influences the dishes on his menu, but emanates the importance of a hearth, a fire and the smoke that goes with it in a delicate weave of humble ingredients. If you have not been to a Michelin star restaurant in Ireland, this is the place to start. Dinner for two with a bottle of wine was ï¿½?94."

483,0,Will Bali EVER bounce back? Shocking pictures show how the holiday hotspot is suffering with no tourists two years into the pandemic,800 words,Mail Online,"* Party central Kuta's once bustling, vibrant nightlife is now just empty streets * Grave fears local economy may never recover after tourist trade was ripped out * Omicron strain of Covid has seen hope diminish for many out of work locals Bali's future is in dire straits, with shocking pictures revealing the once global holiday hotspot now resembles a virtual ghost town two years into the pandemic. With Indonesia heavily reliant on tourism, a continual spike in Covid-19 case numbers and a subsequent lack of overseas guests has plunged the province famed for Kuta Beach and endless bars, restaurants and shops into a shadow of its former self. A YouTube video[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4quad3b5KI] - uploaded on January 23 - titled Poppies Lane Kuta Bali Situation 2022 / Bali Condition Now, provides a confronting, behind the scenes insight into how bleak life has become for many locals. Usually bustling side streets on the once iconic Poppies Lane I and II now feature scores of closed stores, with the video narrator stating it is a 'really sad situation' and that desperate Balinese workers 'hope to see tourists back soon.' In further depressing scenes, the four-star Grand Barong Resort, which was consistently booked out before the pandemic and is walking distance from Kuta Beach, now features endless vacant rooms and no guests from abroad. Scroll down for footage Despite the current grim scenes, Australia is finally poised to re-commence flights to Bali direct from Melbourne on February 14. Further flights from Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide will then depart to Denpasar in early March from carriers Qantas and Jetstar. 'We cannot wait to welcome Aussies back to Bali,' said Uday Rao, General Manager of Four Seasons Resorts Bali. 'Aussies have always been the first to return and the last to leave.' The tourism development from Australian shores will be welcome news given the pandemic has crippled Indonesia, with at least 4.29 million reported Covid cases and 144,000 deaths. The figures are actually tipped to be much higher, with many positive cases and deaths not recorded. Up to September last year, less than 50 guests from abroad visited Bali - compared to 6.3 million in the same period of 2019. Once straining under the weight of 'overtourism', the island's villages are now deserted and countless local businesses are struggling to stay afloat with the prospect international travel might not rebound for years. In the past decade Bali was one of the top tourist destinations in the world, not just for Australians but also for Europeans, North and South Americans. Scooter hire businesses, pubs and eateries sprouted up along the tourist strips as more and more locals began relying on foreign business to make a buck. More than 75,000 hotel rooms were also constructed along its beaches to cope with demand as visitor numbers to Bali grew to record levels in 2019. The same year, TripAdvisor rated the island the top destination in Asia and fourth in the world. Figures released from Bali's tourism board show between 2000 and 2019 foreign visitors quadrupled to be 6.3 million in just nine months - outnumbering the local population of four million. But the arrival of coronavirus in early 2020 abruptly cut off international travel. The island eventually opened up to tourists again in mid-October last year, but required travellers to quarantine at their own expense for five days, which was later dropped to three days. In the first nine months of 2021 before the border was opened, just 43 foreign visitors arrived on the island - all in September and none were on tourists visas, a Bali airport spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal. When Bali and other countries such as Australia and the US finally began easing border rules, the emergence of new Covid variant Omicron then plunged the province into more chaotic times. Experts have forecast new variants of the virus could be an ongoing issue for years. The Indonesian Government said tourism accounted for more than 50 per cent of the Balinese economy and 700,000 workers have been stood down from their jobs since the Covid pandemic began. Bali has since attempted to diversify their economy into other areas such as fishing and manufacturing. Bali Governor Wayan Koster released a recent manifesto in which he called for the island to become less dependent on tourism moving forward. 'The development of tourism was pushed in an incorrect direction and didn't benefit other sectors,' he said."

Our disciplined capital plan for 2022, which reflects an oil market that is in position to rebalance during the year, is focused on investments in high-return ""double premium"" wells along with exploration and infrastructure projects to further improve our business. Combined with our low-cost structure and an improved commodity price environment, EOG is positioned to once again generate significant free cash flow, and we remain firmly committed to our long-standing free cash flow and cash return priorities. Pursuant to this commitment, we paid a $1.00 per share special dividend last month - our third special dividend paid in the last 12 months. In addition, our Board has declared a regular dividend of $0.75 per share, payable April 29, 2022, to stockholders of record as of April 15, 2022.

992,0,"Companies that refuse to exit Russia, and the evil of war",475 words,Business Times Singapore,"1. Withdrawal: Completely halting Russian engagements or exiting Russia. 2. Suspension: Temporarily curtailing operations while keeping return options open. 3. Scaling back: Scaling back some business operations while continuing others. 4. Buying time: Postponing future planned investment, development, or marketing while continuing substantive business. 5. Digging in: Defying demands for exit or reduction of activities. In my commentary, I describe how the list will exert peer pressure on companies to rethink their presence in Russia, particularly consumer-facing goods and services industries that are vulnerable to reputational damage and consumer boycotts. But ultimately, any firm's decision to withdraw from a country is nuanced and seldom binary. Companies must weigh the continued Russian military aggression and reputational cost of going against global opinion, against continuing to serve ordinary citizens who may be bystanders to geopolitical conflict.Ukraine war: The evil that men do Adolf Hitler and Nazism - after all these years - have remained morally instructive and perhaps even more so now, says Professor Chong Siow Ann in this commentary. One of Russian President Vladimir Putin's strangest justifications for the invasion of Ukraine - or the ""special military operation"" as he described it - is saving innocent civilians by ""de-Nazifying"" the country and toppling the government in Kyiv, which he claims has been seized by ""extreme nationalists and neo-Nazis"". This is even though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish and had relatives who perished in the Holocaust. How does one comprehend or justify the atrocities in Bucha - the mass graves and bodies of civilians scattered along its streets? Says Prof Chong: ""In the face of whatever evil being done to others, we should recall the incandescent words of Elie Wiesel: 'We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere'.""New podcast on social and political affairs And on the subject of Ukraine, here's a plug for the new Opinion podcast series, In Your Opinion.

99,1,$10m deal may seal cannabis firmâs IPO,232 words,NT News,"Itâs initial focus will be on supplying the domestic market, where patients currently have access to medicinal cannabis through the Therapeutic Goods Administrationâs Special Access Scheme. According to figures from the TGA, medicinal cannabis approvals have surged to more than 10,000 a month, representing a five-fold increase since 2019. However, according to Mr Barrett, a large number of subscriptions are still not being filled due to a lack of affordability and limited supply. âMedicinal cannabis will be a $US25bn industry globally by 2026 and Australia alone is growing at 100 per cent in the past 12 months,ï¿½?he said. MedTEC is fully licensed by the federal government for the cultivation, manufacture, research and development of medicinal cannabis.

588,0,Packer on cusp of ending family's 23-year rocky affair with Crown,1296 words,The Sydney Morning Herald - Online,"Crown's new chairman Ziggy Switkowski, his chief executive Steven McCann and their bankers at UBS knew to expect the letter. Blackstone's advisers at Morgan Stanley called them on Wednesday afternoon, those close to the events say, triggering a board meeting that night. At 8.40am on Thursday morning, with the written offer in hand, Crown released a statement to the ASX notifying investors not only that Blackstone had increased its offer from $12.50 to $13.10 per share, but what Crown thought about it. Finally, the board said, the price was right. If Blackstone made the offer a binding bid, and nobody trumped it, then shareholders should accept the deal and pass the Crown's casinos in Melbourne and Perth, and its sparkling new Sydney tower on the harbour, Barangaroo, into private hands. In reality there is only one shareholder who matters - James Packer - and he was in Los Angeles where it was approaching 2pm. Despite his still-dominant 37 per cent shareholding, Packer has been effectively frozen out of the company he previously ran as executive chairman after a scathing NSW inquiry found his damaging influence was a key reason Crown was unfit to run the casino at its new $2.2 billion Sydney resort. That meant Packer, the loyal offsiders at his private company Consolidated Press Holdings (CPH), and their adviser Moelis, found out about the new offer at the same time as everyone else. Nevertheless, Packer's team was quick to indicate tentative support in a lunchtime statement which said it was ""encouraged by today's announcement"". A sale would end the Packer family's 23-year association with Crown, which kicked off with Kerry Packer announcing plans to acquire the original Melbourne casino in December 1998. James Packer's determination to make a cathartic exit from the casino operator ï¿½?which has dominated his professional and private life since Crown staff were arrested by Chinese authorities in 2016 ï¿½?is no surprise. Just three years ago the billionaire scion himself was trying to negotiate a takeover of Crown, first with Las Vegas giant Wynn, and then an ill-fated sale to Lawrence Ho of Hong Kong's Melco Resorts. That was before a series of reports by The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald and 60 Minutes into Crown's affairs in July 2019 triggered inquiries which led to Crown being deemed unsuitable to hold its casino licences in Sydney and Melbourne which sent the share price below $9 last year. It has been a long slog getting the share price back above $13, which was Packer's agreed selling price to Melco. But Crown's new regime has acted quickly. Switkowski only formally joined Crown as chairman on December 1. He was brought in to steady the ship alongside a small crew of new directors after two years of rolling scandals and regulatory scrutiny triggered a total clean out of Crown's board and senior management. Crown deemed Blackstone's early December bid of $12.50 as too cheap, but it was enough to offer Blackstone limited access to its books in the hope that would encourage it to go higher. With Blackstone stalking Crown for the best part of a year, one source close to the board said it had enough feedback from shareholders about what they would accept for their shares and had ""war-gamed out"" enough scenarios to be able to respond quickly. The board believes Crown shares (which closed at $11.63 on Wednesday) will certainly be worth more than $13.10 when it recovers from its regulatory woes, and tourism bounces from the pandemic. ""But not within a year"" and not without risk, the source said, making Blackstone's cash the best option for investors. Crown's endorsement of the deal wasn't strictly necessary, either. But two other sources with knowledge of the events said that after knocking back Blackstone three times since March 2021, the suitor wanted a public vote of confidence from Crown if it put another $400 million on the table (which is a raise of $840 million from its opening offer). Blackstone's takeover would need approval from NSW, Victoria and WA's gambling regulators, and has a head start after applying for probity clearance almost a year ago. Its pitch to Crown is to have cash in investors' hands by the end of June - before any rival can start its own regulatory approval process - and while The Star Entertainment Group, Crown's Sydney-based competitor and merger hopeful, is mired in its own probity scandal[https://www-smh-com-au.proxy.library.nyu.edu/business/companies/austrac-expands-probe-into-crown-suitor-the-star-20220114-p59o9b.html]. For those wondering what the future looks like for Packer, if he gets his $3 billion-plus payday and finally cuts loose from the casino operator, it probably is not that much different from his life right now. With the exit of his key lieutenants from the Crown board in February last year, after the NSW casino regulator found it unfit to hold the Barangaroo licence, Crown has effectively been just another investment in the CPH portfolio. ""During the year the company continued to seek appropriate investments,"" said the private company's most recent financial report lodged with ASIC. The accounts reported financial assets totalling more than $8.7 billion at a time when his Crown stake would have been worth well below $3 billion. CPH has been focused back on Packer's first love: Tech investing. ""Tech has always been James' interest,"" said one close associate. The One.Tel failure may loom large on his CV, but the truth is Packer has been an astute investor on this front dating back to his investments in Seek and Carsales.com.au and Zillow (now held by Gretel Packer) in what was an astute bet on the migration of print classified ads to online platforms. He has also remained close to Seek co-founder Paul Bassat. CPH was an early investor in Bassat's venture capital firm Square Peg Capital which has backed the incredibly successful graphic design startup Canva, fintech Airwallex, and Israeli freelance services marketplace Fiverr. As for Packer personally, untethering his fortunes from the business that has caused him so much anguish is not expected to change his personal life much either. ""I feel that, mentally, he is in a much better space, which is wonderful,"" said his mum, Ros Packer, during a tour of the Barangaroo work site in January 2020. ""It shattered him, with the employees in jail in China, it shattered all of us."" And while the $72 million two-storey apartment he acquired last month, atop Crown Barangaroo, gives him a home in Australia, insiders say he is unlikely to spend much time this side of the Pacific Ocean. With Packer's former wife, Erica, and three children residing in Los Angeles, the billionaire is expected to remain largely within his golden triangle of Los Angeles, Aspen, and the soon-to-be-completed mansion in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. It might just be enough that Packer feels his legacy in Australia is complete with the opening of Barangaroo as he hinted back in 2020 during that same site visit. ""I just hope it's something special that Sydney really loves."""
675,0,White House urges Spotify to do MORE to 'combat misinformation' after adding warnings amid Joe Rogan backlash: Psaki says disclaimer is a 'positive first step' - but urges social media and news to be 'more vigilant',1937 words,Mail Online,"* Podcaster has been accused of 'spreading Covid misinformation' on Spotify  * Rogan also questioned the govt's lack of transparency around the pandemic * In his video he promised to 'balance things out' with more varied range of guests * Comes after singer Neil Young removed his music from the streaming giant White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that while Spotify's plans to add a disclaimer to Covid-related content is a 'positive step' after uproar over anti-vaccine stances were shared on Joe Rogan's podcast, but social media networks need to do more. 'This disclaimer is a positive step but we want every platform to continue doing more to call out mis- and disinformation while also uplifting accurate information. I mean, look at the facts,' Psaki said in her daily news briefing on Tuesday. 'Our hope is that all major tech platforms and all major news sources for that matter be responsible and vigilant to ensure the American people have access to accurate information on something as significant as Covid-19. That certainly includes Spotify.' The uproar began when singer Neil Young demanded Spotify either remove his music or remove Joe Rogan's podcast due to its 'misinformation.' Rogan, who has said he was planning to get vaccinated but missed his appointment, hosted two medical experts who expressed skepticism over Covid-19 vaccines.  Spotify, having cut a deal believed to be worth over $100 million with Rogan in 2020, removed Young's music and left up the lucrative podcast host's content. But after a slew of other liberal Hollywood names joined in on calls to boycott Spotify, Rogan himself promised to be more 'balanced' and Spotify promised to make changes to its own policy. On Sunday, Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek laid out plans to introduce more transparent platform rules following Young's allegations but stressed the importance of free speech and providing a platform that shares differing views. He said: 'Personally, there are plenty of individuals and views on Spotify that I disagree with strongly. 'It is important to me that we don't take on the position of being content censor while also making sure that there are rules in place and consequences for those who violate them.' Ek said his company was working to add a content advisory to all podcast episodes that discuss Covid. 'This advisory will direct listeners to our dedicated COVID-19 Hub, a resource that provides easy access to data-driven facts, up-to-date information as shared by scientists, physicians, academics and public health authorities around the world, as well as links to trusted sources,' he said. 'This new effort to combat misinformation will roll out to countries around the world in the coming days. To our knowledge, this content advisory is the first of its kind by a major podcast platform.' He said his team is also exploring ways to promote its platform rules so that content creators better understand the expectations. 'We take this seriously and will continue to partner with experts and invest heavily in our platform functionality and product capabilities for the benefit of creators and listeners alike,' Ek said.'That doesn't mean that we always get it right, but we are committed to learning, growing and evolving.' Hollywood star Dwayne Johnson has rallied around podcaster Joe Rogan after he took to social media to speak out against allegations of 'spreading Covid misinformation' on his Spotify show. Rogan took to Instagram on Sunday to announce he would try to 'balance things out' after he was accused by singer Neil Young and a host of liberal stars of spreading 'misinformation' via his podcast The Joe Rogan Experience (JRE). The podcaster, 54, who has been vocal about the government's lack of transparency around the pandemic, also said he was only seeking to have conversations with people who have 'differing opinions'. His comments came after he hosted American cardiologist Dr Peter McCullough and American virologist and immunologist Dr Robert Malone, both of whom were critical of the way in which the pandemic has been handled in the US. The move sparked an onslaught of criticism among a number of famous names and Spotify was left facing an exodus of talent from stars including Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, and Bruce Springsteen guitarist Nils Lofgren. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex - who recently inked a $25 million deal with Spotify - said they too had reached out to the streaming giant to 'express our concerns' about Rogan's podcast. In response to Rogan's video, actor Dwayne Johnson wrote: 'Great stuff here brother. Perfectly articulated.Look forward to coming on one day and breaking out the tequila with you.' The actor now joins a number of famous names, including Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson and CNN commentator Mary Katharine Ham, who have voiced their support for the podcaster. This week Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson wrote on Twitter: 'I'm triple vaxxed, but (unless they're standing for hate or calling for violence) banning someone's podcast is too much like burning a book to me. 'Joe Rogan should talk on his podcast about whatever he damn well pleases.' Meanwhile CNN commentator Mary Katharine Ham said: 'I don't mind that I disagree with him sometimes, enjoy long-form interviews with interesting people that not a lot of people do, am suspicious of motives for shutting him up, & am weirded out by how many people desire it.' And former presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard wrote on Twitter: 'I get the feeling some people are using Joe Rogan's Covid interview as a pretext to silence his voice because he's not woke. 'Zealots of wokeism try to censor voices who don't agree with theirs, because they fear the absurdity and weakness of their positions will be exposed.' Human rights activist and founder of the AHA Foundation, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, said: 'This is exactly why Joe Rogan's podcast is so popular. He is open to different perspectives and listens to people without judgement.' While commentator Ben Shapiro said: 'They aren't upset with Joe Rogan because of his Covid-19 perspective. They're angry at him because he talks with people they hate. And they can't stand that.' The controversy was sparked by Rogan's two recent episodes of the podcast in which he spoke with Dr Peter McCullough and virologist and immunologist Dr Robert Malone who expressed views that were contrary to much of the Covid information provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and mainstream media outlets. The podcaster also criticized the American government and the CDC's approach to the pandemic since late 2020, speaking out against vaccine mandates, vaccine passes and enforced mask wearing, while cautioning healthy young people under pressure to get jabbed. The move sparked an onslaught of criticism among a number of famous names including Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, and Bruce Springsteen guitarist Nils Lofgren. Young last week threatened to remove his music from Spotify unless Spotify fired Rogan but the streaming giant refused to do this. The folk-rock singer then boycott Spotify and began offering listeners a free four-month subscription to Amazon's streaming service saying: 'Amazon has been leading the pack in bringing hi-res audio to the masses, and it's a great place to enjoy my entire catalogue in the highest quality available.' The Duke and Duchess of Sussex - who recently inked a $25 million deal with Spotify - said they too had reached out to the streaming giant to 'express our concerns' about Rogan's podcast. But the couple have not split with the firm, instead saying they were 'committed to continuing our work together' as it addressed their issues. A spokesman for the Sussexes said: 'Since the inception of [their non-profit organisation] Archewell, we have worked to address the real-time global misinformation crisis. 'Hundreds of millions of people are affected by the serious harms of mis- and disinformation every day. 'Last April, our co-founders began expressing concerns to our partners at Spotify about the all too real consequences of Covid misinformation on its platform. 'We have continued to express our concerns to Spotify to ensure changes to its platform are made to help address this public health crisis. 'We look to Spotify to meet this moment and are committed to continuing our work together as it does.' Addressing the allegations on Instagram Rogan, who has an estimated 11 million listeners, said: 'I'm just a person who sits down and talks to people and has conversations with them. 'Do I get things wrong? Absolutely. I get things wrong, but I try to correct them. 'Whenever I get something wrong, I try to correct it because I'm interested in telling the truth. I'm interested in finding out what the truth is. And I'm interested in having interesting conversations with people that have differing opinions. I'm not interested in only talking to people that have one perspective.' He added: 'I would like to talk to some people that have differing opinions on those podcasts in the future. We'll see. You know, I do all the scheduling myself, and I don't always get it right. 'This, these podcasts are very strange because they're just conversations. And oftentimes I have no idea what I'm going to talk about until I sit down and talk to people and that's why some of my ideas are not that prepared or fleshed out because I'm literally having them in real time. 'But I do my best. And they're just conversations. And I think that's also the appeal of the show. 'It's one of the things that makes it interesting. So I want to thank Spotify for being so supportive during this time. And I'm very sorry that this is happening to them, and that they're taking so much heat from it.' The host also said he was 'not trying to be controversial' and just wanted to have 'interesting conversations'. He continued: 'I'm not trying to promote misinformation, I'm not trying to be controversial. 'I've never tried to do anything with this podcast other than just talk to people and have interesting conversations.' The Joe Rogan Experience is Spotify's highest-rated show, with each episode bringing over 10 million listeners. The streaming service cut a deal believed to be worth over $100 million in late 2020 for the exclusive rights to host Rogan's podcast - which initially aired on YouTube. In the days following Young's accusations against Rogan, Spotify's market value dropped more than $2 billion, with shares tumbling by around 12 per cent. But on Monday Spotify's share price climbed back up after Joe Rogan addressed the controversy.  Spotify shares were going for $197.1 in after-hours trading on Monday evening, after falling to about $165.2 on Friday following the blowback from several musicians. It came as Taylor Swift fans called on the 32-year-old pop star to remove her music from the service in solidarity with Young and Mitchell."

168,0,The end of an era: How the closure of McDonald's 850 restaurants in Russia 32 years after it first launched in Moscow marks the end of the west's engagement with post-Soviet Russia,1166 words,Mail Online,"* Stunning photos shows 30,000 Russians waiting patiently in line for their first Big Mac on January 31, 1990 * Some who were presented at historic opening as the Iron Curtain fell called the closures 'hugely symbolic' When it first opened its doors in January 1990, 30,000 Russians who had lived under the iron fist of Soviet rule queued patiently to get their first taste of McDonald's Big Mac. The fast-food giant's first outlet in Russia opened in Moscow's Pushkin Square, and caused such excitement that some people joined the queue without knowing what it was for. By the end of the day the store had set a new opening-day record for the company and more than 27,000 people applied for waiter jobs. Only 600 were hired. The famous Golden Arches, which were iconic in almost every corner of the globe, had finally reached beyond the Iron Curtain and soon became a symbol of Soviet acceptance of American capitalism. With the fall of the Berlin Wall months before and the vast Soviet Union beginning to crumble away, the McDonald's store had became an unlikely cultural touchstone that would represent a thawing relations with the end of the Cold War.  McDonald's announced yesterday that it is temporarily closing all of its outlets in Russia ï¿½?including its famous original outlet following Vladimir Putin 's invasion of Ukraine. Their move followed similar withdrawals made by Coca-Cola , Pepsi and Starbucks , plunging Russia further into international isolation ï¿½?after three decades of engagement with the West. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg, who was in the queue at the Moscow McDonald's when it opened said its closure was 'hugely symbolic'. Journalist Yuliya Chernova, who was a young child when Russia's first McDonald's outlet opened, recalled yesterday the 'deliciousness' of a milkshake when she tried it for the first time. The Pushkin Square McDonald's opened on January 31, 1990, around 18 months before the Soviet Union collapsed. It was American giant's 11,201st store. It had taken 13 years of negotiations before the Soviet authorities allowed the venue to open. The discussions began in 1976 and were led by George A. Cohon , the president of McDonald's Canada . It then cost $50million to get the operation up and running. The restaurant chain's most famous burger ï¿½?the Big Mac ï¿½?was known in Russia as the Bolshoi Mak, with bolshoi meaning 'big' in Russian. The Daily Mail's original reporting of the Pushin Square venue's opening described how some Russians arrived before dawn in the hope of getting their hands on burgers and fries. Such was its popularity, the queue to get in the venue ended up being more than 90 minutes long.  McDonald's Mr Cohen said of the outlet's opening, 'It's been a long, long road. It's also been worth every drop of sweat. 'Today is the most exciting day of my life, and I salute all those who have come along this path with me.' One 18-year-old customer told the Daily Mail at the time: 'I've seen places like this in American films but I wondered if I would ever be in one. 'For months I've watched this building being prepared.' Another added: 'I'll be here every week. It is already my favourite food. Other amazed customers told the New York Times that the 'Bolshoi Mak' was 'something like you've never tasted before.' 'You take a bun, a very tasty bun, and you cut it in half. Then you add some grilled meat, top quality meat, mind you, not like the meat we get here,' they said. 'Then some cheese, then very many vitamins and then you add some spinach. And that, comrades, is the Bolshoi Mak.' It was not only the customers who were scrambling to get through the restaurant's doors. Of the 600 jobs that were advertised, around 27,000 applications were received. When the venue opened, restaurants in Russia were known for their terrible hygiene, lack of menu options and poor service. The feelings about the lack of choice were made clear by another customer, who told The Washington Post that 'finding a decent place to eat is one of our biggest problems'. 'This place looks different just from the outside. Everything is so clean and bright,' they added. However, because of the low wages of nearly all people in Russia, eating in a McDonald's venue was a luxury, rather than the cheap option it offered in Western nations. One customer said: 'We certainly could not afford to eat here every day. This is a high-class restaurant by our standards.' The Pushkin Square restaurant was welcoming to all however, with a brass sign outside declaring 'For Soviet rubles only' in a dig at other restaurants nearby that would cater to westerners with more easily convertible dollars or pounds. As the years progressed and Russia embraced capitalism, hundreds more McDonald's outlets opened, along with those from rival fast food chains such as Pizza Hut (a few months later in 1990) and KFC [http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/d572a6723eed46804db8d000236e5287](1995). Rival Burger King trailed behind with its first [https://popkult.org/burger-king-russia-localization/#:~:text=Burger%20King%20is%20a%20relative,Moscow%20only%20in%20January%2C%202010.]restaurant in 2010. Even its ruling class welcomed their arrival, with former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev famously appearing in a 1998 advertisement for Pizza Hut . But in the space of a few days the slow arrival of western brands has been dramatically undone. Led by oil giant such as BP and Shell who faced boycotts if they didn't end their Russian partnerships, the last week has seen a wave of companies from Apple and Ikea to Volvo and Visa suspend or pull their operations. The latest set of brands to stop services included Starbucks , Coca-Cola and Pepsi, all coming swiftly after McDonald's . Western sanctions and the encouragement of brands to temporarily leave Russia will make it clear to regular Russians that the Ukrainian invasion comes with a high price, even if the true cost is somewhat hidden by state media.  McDonald's has pledged to continue supporting its 62,000 staff in Russia with full salaries, and have said the lights on the golden arches will only be going off 'temporarily'. 'For 66 years, we have operated with the belief that communities are made better when there's a McDonald's nearby,' McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a statement. Now for millions in Russia, it is unclear for how long this will not be the case."
164,0,Thinking of Going to Southeast Asia? Hereâs What to Expect.,2338 words,NYTimes.com Feed,"Before their February trip, Ms. Laird spent nearly three hours uploading all the documents ï¿½?vaccination records, hotel reservations, and proof of health insurance among them ï¿½?needed for the Thailand Pass [https://tp.consular.go.th/], an entry requirement instituted for international travelers during the pandemic. âFor many people who are not computer literate, itâs going to be a problem,ï¿½?Ms. Laird said. After a long and painful hiatus, and despite rising cases [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-cases.html] of coronavirus in some Southeast Asian countries and lingering United States government warnings [https://travel-state-gov.proxy.library.nyu.edu/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html/] against travel to most of them, international tourism is now gradually returning to Southeast Asia. Mr. Lamberty and Ms. Laird are among the early waves of visitors since the pandemic restrictions turned the regionâs tourism playgrounds into ghost towns in early 2020. More countries in recent weeks announced that they are ready to admit fully-vaccinated foreign tourists, or soon will be, though still within limits. The rollout of vaccines in Southeast Asia and rollback of coronavirus restrictions around the world are prompting the reopening. Now, the war in Ukraine is complicating the travel picture everywhere, as the general unease could make people think twice about booking a big trip ï¿½?or potentially opt for Southeast Asia, 4,500 miles from Ukraine, instead of Europe. In November, Thailand and Cambodia were among the first countries in Southeast Asia to fully reopen to tourists. After an Omicron surge, Thailand in December suspended most tourist arrivals, but on Feb. 1 resumed its nationwide âTest & Go [https://www.tatnews.org/2022/02/thailand-reopening-exemption-from-quarantine-test-go/]ï¿½?program, which requires hotel isolation and a PCR test the first day and a rapid test the fifth day. Days later, Bali [https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/news/latest-travel-regulations-to-enter-bali] fully reopened to foreigners, though with a quarantine of three to seven days (then dropped [https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/news/luhut-b-pandjaitan-indonesia-will-do-a-quarantine-free-trial-period-on-14-march-2022â] the quarantine requirement this month). The Philippines [https://visitor.tourism.gov.ph/?fbclid=IwAR3udYUyKLv-WkKJ6pex7l8JEia_uhCjSetJPevVQr0WFma7-qu5i_TDjZA] followed Feb. 10, with no quarantine but with social distancing in some locations. Vietnam [https://vn.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/]announced that it would open its borders March 15 to international tourists, with a one-day hotel isolation. And Malaysia on Tuesday announced it was reopening April 1 [https://www.facebook.com/ismailsabri60] without a quarantine. As the once tourist-dependent region reopens its borders, travelers should expect more paperwork, higher airfares, cheaper hotels (for the short-term) and less crowds ï¿½?especially since China, the biggest single source of tourists in the region, has no plans to reopen its borders anytime soon. Travel operators are grappling with a shortage of labor, lingering uncertainty over the virus and now the war in Ukraine, and impatience ï¿½?they worry that those deeply missed tourists will go elsewhere in the region unless their own country is the first to fully reopen. âI think for the next 12 months itâs going to be pretty complicated to travel in Asia,ï¿½?said Adam Platt-Hepworth, whose Grasshopper Adventures [https://www.grasshopperadventures.com/multi-day-cycling-tours/cambodia-bike-hike-kayak-tour/] cycling tour company worked with 30,000 travelers in 2019 and fewer than 50 in 2020. âThe biggest challenge overall is just going to be restarting after so long, not just with our people but with hotels and restaurants and anyone in travel. Itâs been a long time. People are rusty.ï¿½?Complications abound for travelers Before the pandemic, Southeast Asia was one of the fastest-growing regions in the world for international tourism, with a record 139 million visitors in 2019, a jump of about 8 percent compared to 2018, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization [https://www-unwto-org.proxy.library.nyu.edu/unwto-tourism-dashboard]. The emerald waters of Halong Bay in Vietnam were crowded with hundreds of cruise boats, rooftops bars in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia teemed with partyers and walking on streets on Thai islands like Phuket meant enduring shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. Tourist attractions across the region were congested with package tours from China, the worldâs biggest source of outbound tourism for the past decade. According to the U.N.W.T.O [https://www-e-unwto-org.proxy.library.nyu.edu/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284421138]., about 150 million Chinese travelers spent $277 billion in 2018 alone. Countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore and Cambodia were among favorite destinations of Chinese tourists. But as the coronavirus outbreak in China morphed into a global pandemic in early 2020, locations in the region that depended on foreign visitors were deserted. Last year, foreign arrivals to Southeast Asia plummeted to 3.3 million, or around 2 percent of the record number in 2019. This year, with the incremental revival of international tourism, visitors will encounter a raft of constraints as well as rewards, according to tourists and travel companies in the region. Mr. Lamberty and Ms. Laird vacationed in Phuket 16 times before the pandemic. They were usually out and about on the island ï¿½?fabled for its tropical beaches, fiery cuisine, hedonistic nightlife ï¿½?and enjoyed visiting temples and taking Thai cooking classes. This time, they took it easy, visiting friends and relaxing at their go-to beachfront hotel, Dusit Thani Laguna Phuket [https://www.dusit.com/dusitthani-lagunaphuket] on the Andaman Sea. They were sad to see that boutiques had closed in a nearby shopping center, now a Covid testing site. âYou have a memory of whatâs happened before and what was here, but everybody has to compromise,ï¿½?Ms. Laird said. âBe brave about travel and go for it; the prize is just being here.ï¿½?Travelers going after that prize should be prepared to endure virus tests and even quarantines, and purchase health and travel insurance before their arrival. Other suggestions: Be ready to download government travel apps, upload vaccination and travel documents, and acknowledge that a positive virus test result could send you into a quarantine or cause a missed flight. Donât be surprised if service at hotels, restaurants and tour companies is spotty or if they are short staffed ï¿½?or if the government rules change suddenly while youâre on holiday. Higher flight costs are another unwanted change. Airfares from the United States to Southeast Asia last month were about 30 percent higher than before the pandemic, because fewer planes were flying to the region, averaging $1,150 round trip, according to an analysis for The Times by Hopper, the flight and hotel booking company. âGenerally, as airlines add capacity to these countries, airfares should drop,ï¿½?said Adit Damodaran, an economist at Hopper [https://www.hopper.com/]. However, itâs easy to find a bargain on a room as the regionâs wide spectrum of accommodations, from hostels to luxury resorts, comes back. Popular tourist attractions and destinations that were suffering from overtourism, like Phi Phi Leh Island in Thailand, Angkor Wat in Cambodia and Boracay in the Philippines, will be less packed. And while many Western-style restaurants went bankrupt, the options for discovering local cuisines continue to be seemingly endless. Online booking platforms like Hopper and Booking.com say searches for flights and hotels are on the rise in Southeast Asia. According to Googleâs Destinations Insights [https://destinationinsights.withgoogle.com/intl/en_ALL/], searches on Vietnam grew the fastest of all countries from December to February, by 75 percent. International and regional airlines like Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways and Vietnamâs VietJet are returning mothballed planes to the skies. Slow recovery predicted by operators Despite these positive indications, most travel operators do not expect a return to the boom year of 2019 this year or even next. âIt may take two years more,ï¿½?said Le Tuan Kiet, the operations manager for the cruise line Indochina Junk [https://www.indochina-junk.com/] in Vietnamâs Halong Bay. The company docked all but two of its 16 boats and focused on domestic tourism, which helped keep tourism alive in places like Dalat in the mountains and Vung Tau on the coast. Indochina Junk converted the two luxury cruise ships to domestic day tours with karaoke sound systems and Vietnamese fare, said Mr. Kiet. But those efforts brought only a relative trickle of guests, and most of the companyâs 250 workers lost their jobs and went back to their families, he said, and some found work in factories. Luring them back will not be easy, he said. âThey donât want to move from their hometowns to the city again,ï¿½?he said. For Mr. Platt-Hepworth of Grasshopper Adventures, hiring staff is also difficult, as some of the companyâs employees pivoted to other work during the pandemic, like opening a bakery in Taiwan and becoming a cycling coach in Vietnam, he said. During the desolation, his remaining staff of seven, a decimated number from 140 permanent and casual workers, spent months revising an app for self-guided tours, with live-chat messaging, recommendations on restaurants and hotels, and a podcast about the next dayâs ride. That was prescient, because as Grasshopper [https://www.grasshopperadventures.com/multi-day-cycling-tours/cambodia-bike-hike-kayak-tour/]began to offer tours in a handful of destinations last year, âthereâs been a surge in interest in self-guided tours, for obvious reasons,ï¿½?he said. Keeping tabs on the shifting travel directives for various countries is difficult too. Grasshopper started offering tours first in Sri Lanka, then Thailand, Uzbekistan and Cambodia, where the Nov. 15 reopening was one of Southeast Asiaâs least restrictive, just a rapid coronavirus test on arrival. Varying reopening plans Despite Vietnamâs March 15 reopening date, Indochina Junk is holding off booking trips until September, mainly to make sure that international airlines restart enough flights, Mr. Kiet said. The company will reopen with only six boats and its three-day cruises will likely be cheaper, he said. If a quarantine is required, he said, guests can do it on the boats. Vietnamâs reopening announcement came in the wake of a 2021 Delta variant surge that led to a monthslong nationwide lockdown, a switch in policy from zero-Covid to living with the virus, and a stepped-up government push to get the population vaccinated. Its rate of fully vaccinated citizens has reached 80 percent. Even though an Omicron surge in late February was generating a record number of cases, Mr. Kiet was confident the government would stick to the date. âWe need to get the economy going now before the other countries,ï¿½?he said. The economic upheaval for Russia brought on by its invasion of Ukraine could mean fewer tourists to Vietnam and Thailand, popular destinations for Russians. For now, âthe impact isnât that clear,ï¿½?said Nantida Atiset, the vice president of the Phuket Tourist Association. In Phuket these days, some 2,500 to 3,000 foreigners are arriving daily at the airport, though thatâs less than a third of the traffic during prepandemic days, Ms. Atiset said. âItâs not as packed and crowded as before,ï¿½?she said. âNow, itâs high season, sunshine everyday, and on average hotels are 35 percent cheaper than before.ï¿½?Lush countryside and local dishes still beckon Ad and Patricia Ketelaars, semiretired Dutch entrepreneurs who moved to Singapore seven years ago, last month decided to take their first adventure trip in the region in two years. They wanted to cycle in Thailand on a self-guided tour, but it was âtoo complicated,ï¿½?Mr. Ketelaars said. They opted for Cambodia and booked a guided tour with Grasshopper Adventures, setting out on Feb. 28 from Phnom Penh and ending eight days later in Siem Reap. They were most looking forward to returning to the lush countryside, said Mr. Ketelaars just before the trip and in between taking a coronavirus test in Singapore and researching the best hospitals in Cambodia. âThe anxiety of these types of things is, what if you test positive?ï¿½?he said. âYou want to make sure you wind up in a place that can deal with it.ï¿½?Michael Williams, a cargo pilot who lives in Wisconsin, plans to travel to Vietnam at the end of this month, to finally meet the woman from Hanoi he has been dating online for a year. After talking daily for hours on WhatsApp, he and his girlfriend and her daughter will be together to start figuring out the future, Mr. Williams said. They hope to have time for a beach weekend in Danang, and heâs looking forward to trying local dishes and soaking up the history and culture. Heâll get a booster before the flight, so heâs not worried about an outbreak, and heâs not concerned about Russiaâs war on Ukraine as long as itâs contained to Eastern Europe. âItâs just a matter of making it real and getting there,ï¿½?he said.

The mission is to educate one million families in Asia through the Eating Right is a Lifestyle program by 2025. The management team-comprising food scientists, doctors, dieticians, and naturopaths-states its purpose as ""empowering people with the latest nutrition information through technology, preventing chronic lifestyle diseases and obesity."" Farmz Asia is one of the few South East Asian firms to offer funded 'basic nutrition' and 'healthy food' courses. The WSQ programs, quality-assured by SkillsFuture Singapore, give learners an equal footing, regardless of background. The founders see potential for the company beyond an exit plan; they aim to benefit citizens worldwide. They recently turned down an acquisition proposal for $75 million from a prominent player in the natural health industry, in order to make room for the right partners in the future that align with their vision. Their vision is to give children the tools they need to make healthier dietary decisions. Throughout 2022, the firm will expand its reach to serve more SEA countries, deploying courses via its 'lifestyle super app'. Enterprise Singapore has indicated it will support Farmz Asia endeavors. To create a massive shift in children's nutritional habits, scale is essential. Technology offers the means to reach a wide audience both quickly and efficiently. Farmz Asia is poised to use additional funding, and cutting-edge tech, to make a significant change not only in SE Asia but throughout the world.  https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/8520/120557_fde3daf714fa484c_002full.jpg [https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/8520/120557_fde3daf714fa484c_002full.jpg]  (Link to Image: https://drive-google-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/file/d/1Z2YaQtHljJVzxUteU-3Va2F0gsSOD3MD/view?usp=sharing [https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/RVJPAcD1oe] ) Contact Details: Contact Name: Farmz Asia Client Care Email: sayhello@farmzasia.com [mailto:sayhello@farmzasia.com]  Website: www.farmzasia.com [https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/kzLkgh18K4]  Address: 114 Lavender Street, #12-85, CT Hub 2, 338729 Singapore To view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/120557 [https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/BNejgs0rXD]"
608,1,Asian Morning Briefing: U.S. Stocks Fall as Banks Report Earnings,1812 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"MARKET WRAPS EQUITIES U.S. stocks fell as investors worried that soaring inflation and slowing growth are starting to affect businesses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.3%. The S&P 500 lost about 1.2% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index dropped around 2.1%. Investors got their first peek at how companies fared in the first quarter of 2022 as earnings season kicked off in earnest this week. ""We're starting to see some cracks in the foundation of the super strong consumer, and it's starting to have some impact on company bottom lines, "" said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. ""Retail sales are still good, but we saw JPMorgan is going to raise their provisions for credit losses because there could be some defaults. At Wells Fargo, we're seeing some impact of higher mortgage rates. Sentiment is not as good."" U.S. stock markets will be closed on Friday for the holiday-shortened trading week. The Nikkei Stock Average closed 1.2% higher, helped by gains for consumer stocks. Apparel retailer Adastria was among the best performers, rising 11% after it reported an earnings recovery and guided for a 28% net profit rise for the new fiscal year. Other consumer stocks were also higher. Confectionary company Morinaga & Co. rose 1.0% and beverage maker Yakult Honsha added 1.7%. Chinese stocks ended higher, supported by hopes of further monetary easing, IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong said in a note. There are indications from Chinese authorities that further monetary easing is on the way, with China likely to cut banks' reserve requirement ratios, although the timing is uncertain, Yeap said. Liquor-makers and banks rose. The Shanghai Composite Index closed 1.2% higher, the Shenzhen Composite Index climbed 1.1%, and the ChiNext Price Index was down 0.02%. Elsewhere, New Zealand's NZX-50 closed 0.1% higher in a shortened Easter trading week. Much of the decline for the week was driven by two stocks: interest-rate sensitive Meridian Energy and Fisher & Paykel Healthcare. Meridian ended the week down more than 5.0% and Fisher & Paykel Healthcare lost 4.8%. New Zealand King Salmon slumped nearly 28% over escalating mortality at its fish farms. And Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index closed 0.6% higher as the latest data showed the jobless rate stayed steady. Energy and technology stocks were standouts, both closing 1.3% higher, but financial stocks were a drag ending the day 0.3% lower. Regional lender BOQ was the day's biggest loser, falling 6.3% despite reporting a 38% uptick in half-year profit. The major banks finished the day lower by between 0.1% and 0.7%. COMMODITIES Oil futures settled higher after the New York Times reported that European Union officials were drafting a ban on oil imports from Russia. West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery rose 2.6% to settle at $106.95 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. June Brent crude, the global benchmark, added 2.7% to $111.70 on ICE Futures Europe. Gold futures posted their first loss in six sessions, but ended higher for the week as the precious metal continued to find support as a hedge against inflation. June gold fell 0.5% to settle at $1,974.90 an ounce. For the week, gold settled 1.5% higher. ""It's clear that gold has headwinds from the dollar and yields,"" said Ross Norman, chief executive officer at Metals Daily. ""Add to that the lockdown in Shanghai and [Hong Kong] and it's surprising its doing so well."" TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES High Gasoline Prices Take Up Big Share of March Retail Spending Increase U.S. retail sales rose in March for the third straight month as consumers confronted the highest inflation in four decades and absorbed record-high gasoline prices. Retail and restaurant spending rose by 0.5% in March compared with the previous month, the Commerce Department said Thursday, down from the revised monthly increase of 0.8% in February. Gasoline sales jumped 8.9% in March over the previous month after Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered higher oil and gasoline prices. Excluding gasoline sales, retail sales fell by 0.3%. ECB to Trail Fed in Tightening Monetary Policy Despite Rising Inflation FRANKFURT-The European Central Bank will continue to lag behind the Federal Reserve in tightening monetary policy despite rising inflation, ECB President Christine Lagarde said on Thursday, helping to drive the euro to a near five-year low against the dollar. Ms. Lagarde's comments, which came despite increasingly clear signs that the war in Ukraine is pushing already high fuel and food prices even higher, also weighed on short-dated eurozone government bond yields as investors pared back expectations that the ECB will aggressively lift interest rates. The war is shaping up as a stagflationary shock for Europe, threatening to depress economic growth while driving up prices in a region that relies heavily on energy imports from Russia. That complicates the ECB's task of removing pandemic-era stimulus measures to regain control over inflation without damaging the postpandemic recovery. Other major central banks, including the Fed, are moving ahead with plans for the most aggressive cycle of interest-rate increases in decades, with sweeping implications for global asset prices. Fed's John Williams Says Half-Point Rate Rise Is Reasonable Option for May  Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said a large interest-rate increase is a good prospect at the central bank's early May meeting, as part of an effort to move short-term rates up aggressively to contend with high inflation. A half-percentage-point increase at the May 3-4 rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting is ""a very reasonable option,"" Mr. Williams said Thursday on Bloomberg Television. While noting no decision has been made yet, Mr. Williams said the central bank's short-term interest-rate target range is ""very low"" in an environment of high inflation. ""From a monetary policy point of view, it does make sense for us to move expeditiously towards more normal levels of the federal-funds rate, and also did move forward on our balance-sheet reduction plans,"" said Mr. Williams, who is also vice chairman of the FOMC. Putin Says Western Sanctions Have Disrupted Russian Oil Industry President Vladimir Putin acknowledged that Western sanctions have stymied Russia's energy industry, the country's economic engine, and that it will need to reorient oil and gas sales from markets in Europe to Asia. ""The most acute [problem] is associated with a disruption of the logistics of export deliveries,"" Mr. Putin said Thursday during a government meeting. Mr. Putin said banks from ""unfriendly countries,"" which includes the European Union, are delaying the transfer of payments. Russia's biggest energy customers by far are in Europe. While the EU hasn't banned Russian oil and gas deliveries, sanctions have blocked some funding, technology and equipment necessary for the development of the sector. Some traders have avoided Russian oil, which is currently offered at a heavy discount to international benchmarks. The U.S. and Canada have both announced embargoes on Russian crude. Elon Musk Makes $43 Billion Bid for Twitter, Says 'Civilization' At Stake A week into his rolling clash with Twitter Inc., Elon Musk went full-on corporate raider, offering to buy the company and warning he might sell his stake in the service if rebuffed. The Tesla Inc. chief on Thursday morning made a $43 billion bid for Twitter, the latest in a will-he-or-won't-he saga between the world's richest man and the social-media service. The offer was at once serious-Mr. Musk disclosed it in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission-and had the markings of a gag. The offer was for $54.20 per share, a barely veiled marijuana reference.  Twitter appeared to be taking the matter seriously. The company confirmed it had received the offer and said its board would review the proposal. It is also weighing a so-called poison pill, a legal mechanism that would prevent Mr. Musk from increasing his stake in the company significantly, according to a person familiar with the situation. Wall Street's Deal-Making Boom Starts to Sputter Out Wall Street was expected to return to normal in 2022 after the pandemic sent it on a wild ride two years ago. It didn't. Major U.S. banks reported double-digit drops in first-quarter profit this week, from an 11% decline at Morgan Stanley to a 46% drop at Citigroup Inc. Those banks, along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co., all reported lower revenue as well. The highest inflation in decades and the war in Ukraine raised concerns in the first quarter about a possible recession. Commodity prices surged as the war triggered fears of energy and food shortages. Bonds and stocks both sold off, an unusual tandem move that reflected investors' worries. Corporate chiefs, who had fueled Wall Street's two-year dealmaking boom, stayed on the sidelines.

733,1,"Bank of Montreal CEO says rapid rate hikes needed to tame inflation as central banks walk a âtightropeï¿½? The Bank of Canadaâs decision to raise its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point on Wednesday was âgood and necessary,ï¿½?BMO CEO Darryl White said in an interview after BMOâs annual shareholder meeting",841 words,The Globe and Mail (Breaking News),"Central bankers around the world are seized with the challenge of reining in inflation, which in Canada reached its highest level in three decades in February, at 5.7 per cent. That level of inflation is hard to slay, Mr. White said, meaning Canada will probably face âa pretty rapid pace of hikesï¿½?to interest rates over the coming months. âWhen you are at a 30-year high, this is an important fight to pick and I think itâs the right one.ï¿½?Yet that battle is also stoking fears over the impact higher rates may have on economic growth. Economies recovering from a global pandemic are already grappling with the fallout from the war in Ukraine, the latest resurgence of COVID-19 cases in many countries, continued supply chain problems, and tight labour markets that are driving up wages and leaving jobs unfilled. âYou put all that together and you say, wow, this is a bit of a tightrope, and itâs difficult to solve,ï¿½?Mr. White said. âBut I do think that if youâre in a central bankerâs chair, there isnât any choice at this point but to say, âall right, weâre going to do the best we can to tame inflation.ï¿½?ï¿½?The oversized rate increase the Bank of Canada announced Wednesday should help start to cool inflation, Mr. White said. But with further rate increases expected to follow, higher borrowing costs are likely to begin eating into demand for some key banking products such as mortgages, where customers are already carrying heavy debts. In the near term, economic signals are still solid. Unemployment hit its lowest level in 50 years in March, at 5.3 per cent; many consumers still have extra savings stashed away from the pandemic; and GDP is expected to grow by a healthy 4.2 per cent this year.  BMO has benefited from an economic rebound in Canada and the U.S., reporting strong financial results in recent quarters. And it used a large stockpile of extra capital amassed during the pandemic, when dividend increases and share buybacks were temporarily forbidden, to make a landmark $17-billion deal to acquire California-based Bank of the West [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-bmo-to-buy-california-based-bank-of-the-west-from-frances-bnp-paribas/] , which Mr. White still expects will close this year. Risks to banks are building, but âour base case remains constructive, and we believe that reports of a recession are greatly exaggerated,ï¿½?Meny Grauman, an analyst at Scotia Capital Inc., said in a note to clients on Wednesday. Looking a year to 18 months down the road, however, Mr. White said the economic picture âgets more uncertain.ï¿½?That is one reason why senior business leaders have been pressing Ottawa to shift focus to prioritize economic growth [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-the-big-rift-corporate-canada-wants-ottawa-to-focus-on-real-growth-not/] , productivity, business investment and spending restraint to cut down federal deficits. The budget presented last week âdoes represent a turn in the right direction from the government,ï¿½?Mr. White said, showing greater attention to those priorities. âIf I were to pick on something, I would say if you consider an environment where inflation is at a 30-year high and unemployment is at a 50-year low, if there were ever a time for faster deficit-reduction plans, this feels like it could be it,ï¿½?Mr. White said. He also joined other senior bankers in criticizing a new two-part surtax on banks and insurers [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-federal-budget-2022-bank-life-insurer-tax/] outlined in last weekâs budget. Ottawa plans to raise $6.1-billion over five years by permanently increasing the corporate tax rate for many banks and insurers by 1.5 percentage points, and adding a one-time tax on 2021 profits that were propped up by government stimulus. Mr. White said the taxes are âbad policyï¿½?that unfairly target bank shareholders, create distortions in markets and serve to discourage investments in Canada. âIâm not a fan of this part of the budget,ï¿½?he said.

874,0,Twitter suspends hundreds of accounts promoting Philippines' Marcos Jr,401 words,Agence France Presse,"Twitter said it had reviewed the accounts and hashtags identified in a recent article by Philippine news site Rappler. More than 300 accounts had been removed ""for violating our platform manipulation and spam policy,"" Twitter said in a statement sent to AFP Saturday. Most of them had been taken down before the Rappler article was published on Tuesday and an investigation was ongoing, it said. Filipinos are among the world's heaviest users of social media and the country has become a key battleground for fake news. ""With the Philippine elections taking place this May, we remain vigilant about identifying and eliminating suspected information campaigns targeting election conversations,"" Twitter said. Marcos Jr's spokesman Vic Rodriguez said there was ""no certainty"" that all the suspended accounts belonged to supporters of the presidential hopeful. Election victory for Marcos Jr would mark the ultimate political comeback for the family, which was chased into exile in the United States after its patriarch's humiliating downfall in 1986. Marcos Sr and his wife Imelda were accused of massive corruption while in power. Recent voter surveys show Marcos Jr holding a huge lead over his nearest rival and nemesis Leni Robredo, who is the incumbent vice president. Rappler said Marcos Jr supporters were ""looking to dominate Twitter"" and that many of the accounts it investigated were created around the time he announced his bid for the presidency in October. The accounts pushed the narrative that the Marcoses were ""victims"" of the 1986 revolt and their return to Malacanang presidential palace is ""long overdue"", it added.  Twitter said sharing political content on an account or rallying people do so via hashtags was allowed, ""unless the accounts are inauthentic, compensated or automated, which we see no clear evidence of in this case."" Last Monday, the social media giant said it was expanding a test feature that will allow users in Brazil, Spain and the Philippines to report misleading content. cgm/amj/oho"

396,0,Schools will close only as last resort: Ardern,709 words,The New Zealand Herald,"Ardern yesterday set out her agenda for the year on the first day of Parliament under red light restrictions ï¿½?meaning masks around Parliament and only half the full contingent of MPs in the debating chamber at any time. Freedom Convoy demonstrators gathered outside, protesting against Covid-response restrictions. Ardern focused mainly on Covid as the Government negotiated the Omicron outbreak and prepared for future variants. She said the Government was committed to keeping schools open after a disrupted two years during lockdowns. âThe latest evidence shows that school closures are finely balanced. âThey can cause significant indirect harm to children, including widening educational inequities, poorer mental health, behavioural difficulties, social isolation, family stress, family violence and food insecurity.ï¿½?She said they also had a disproportionate impact on MÄori and Pasifika children, as well as those from poorer households. âWe are committed to keeping schools and early learning services open, with closures only as a last resort due to a significant outbreak in a school or service, staff absences that make it unsafe to operate, or a local lockdown.ï¿½?Ardern said the Government focus was on improving the health system to deal with the upcoming winter, and the influenza vaccination rollout would be critical to help reduce the risk of âunnecessary pressuresï¿½?on the health system: a double-header flu and Covid outbreak. Speaking to the media afterwards, she said that although flu rates had been low since the borders closed, the RSV scare last year showed how much pressure outbreaks could put on the health system. The Government was expanding free flu jab eligibility, and would run a vaccination campaign and use the Covid-19 infrastructure to roll it out. Soon after her speech, Health Minister Andrew Little announced the eligibility would widen to cover about 250,000 more people, about two million in all. Ardern also said New Zealand was in a better position now than most other countries it compared itself to and credited the Governmentâs Covid-19 response with protecting New Zealanders from the âDelta destructionï¿½?other countries had faced. However, National Party leader Christopher Luxon took aim at that Covid-19 management, saying although 2020 had been strong, 2021 had been a âshamblesï¿½? He dedicated most of his speech to the economy and cost of living, pointed to the rising cost of petrol and groceries, the wage gap between New Zealand and Australia, and the steep increase in house prices. âYou get a Prime Minister who promised to make housing more affordable but instead sheâs delivered the largest, fastest increase in house prices in our nationâs history. âThe average house price is now over $1 million, and in just four years of Labour mismanagement weâve seen house prices rise by a staggering $380,000. Itâs a truly shocking result of Government incompetence.ï¿½?He also predicted that Labour would end up backing down on its Three Waters reforms, saying Finance Minister Grant Robertson would decide it was too unpopular to go ahead with. Ardern had confirmed in her opening statement that the Government would forge ahead with Three Waters this year, after it was delayed last year for more consultation because of opposition from councils. âIt is clear that without our plan to establish four publicly owned water service entities we will continue to see a frail network and contaminated water in many communities. âTo delay will only push the problem on, and increase future household costs.ï¿½?Ardernâs speech also looked at other Government priorities, including health reforms. The measures will abolish district health boards and set up a Health NZ agency and MÄori Health Authority alongside it. She said the pandemic showed the current systemâs weaknesses. Other areas of focus included climate change and environmental measures, child poverty, housing supply and infrastructure projects the Government had announced."
582,1,"Environment - Environmental Impact; Investigators at University of Rosario Discuss Findings in Environmental Impact (Characterization of Cooling Equipment In the Food Industry: Case Study of the Colombian Meat, Dairy, and Fruit and Vegetable Sectors)",613 words,Food Weekly News,"Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Rosario, ""This study analyses three food sectors in Colombia that use refrigerant systems based on the requirements of the quality, processing and preservation of products and material service in emerging economies, where it is important to determine the baseline technology level and identify beneficial system innovations. This paper provides an overview of the value chains, production levels and trends, cooling systems, material services and maintenance processes for three sectors using qualitative and quantitative methods and different knowledge sources, including a survey and previous studies related to refrigeration in the food industry. The results show that the infrastructure most used is a cold chamber or cold storage, followed by refrigerators and the equipment used in the refrigeration systems, including compressors, condensers, evaporators and, to a lesser extent, chillers, on which preventive and corrective maintenance is performed every three to four months. The equipment and accessories largely come from the United States, Europe and China, and purchasing decisions are based on price. The results also indicate that it is important that decision makers in these three sectors increase their awareness and knowledge of cooling equipment and its environmental impacts with the aim of improving productivity and decreasing pollution. In particular, material services that require resources such as energy and other materials should be more environmentally friendly. Based on these findings, the government could design different instruments for technological change. The majority of cooling systems in the three sectors have been in operation for over 10 years. Thus, in a country where agricultural diversity and export capacity are key contributors to development and economic growth in rural areas, strategies to implement cold chain systems that are less polluting and more productive are essential. The findings of this study are important for establishing actions for change and technology transfer and promoting the modernization of the agricultural market through exports."" According to the news editors, the research concluded: ""It is important to ensure an effective cold chain utilizing environmentally friendly and efficient refrigeration systems, which may provide access to new markets for natural and fresh food products.""

474,1,The first global NFT Day in Paris presented big ideas for fashion brands,1227 words,Glossy,"With representatives from Kering, LâOrÃ©al and Sothebyâs present at NFT Day, many of the talks took a look behind the curtain of fashionâs and beautyâs biggest NFT projects to date. For example, the first big fashion-focused panel centered on the next era of luxury brands and NFTs, based on explorations thus far by Gucci, Balenciaga and Balmain. Discussion topics ranged from what brands should focus on when first getting into the NFT space to extending their existing projects. Here are some key things the panelists addressed during the day. Community-building is key One of the biggest takeaways from the conversations on community-building with NFTs is simple: Define the value proposition. What is unique about the brand that they can add to the NFT space? Brand value propositions can create interesting projects that people will want to buy into as they change and grow over time. NFT value propositions, meanwhile, are centered on function and utility.  GrÃ©gory BouttÃ©, chief client and digital officer at Kering, said that with every NFT project Kering is doing, the team is trying to create a sense of community. Itâs also trying to augment its NFTsÂ with the story it wants to tell around its fashion houses and the emotions it wants to create around its products. Creating a digital rendering or garment may not take long, but building a community can only happen by spending time and focusing on unique value propositions. âThe first thing weâve seen work, in terms of community, is creativity, especially in the NFT and digital artwork space. One of the value propositions of luxury houses is creativity ï¿½?creating amazing, innovative products. From that perspective, thereâs a strong alignment here between the luxury industry and the web3 or NFT space,ï¿½?said BouttÃ©. Community members are more likely to join and buy an NFT if it isnât just a piece of digital artwork or garment. By giving functions or adding additional experiences to NFT purchases, brands can stand out and create long-term incentives for buyers to stay in their community. Buyers are looking for community-focused projects that are carefully thought out and curated, offering value and essentially turning them into club members, where only those with the purchased tokens can access brand-exclusive events and goods. âWeâve seen that providing access and utility, and not just digital artwork, works really well [to pique interest],ï¿½?said BouttÃ©. For example, the Adam Bomb Squad project[https://www.adambombsquad.com/] is giving out royalties to community members from goods using its artwork, while a large-scale project by D&G has given buyers a unique couturier experience. For Kering, keeping the community updated through its Discord and detailing regular updates on its NFT roadmap allows for a connection with the people in it. Features like whitelists that function as a VIP access list in the NFT world are a great example, giving early adopters guaranteed access to mint at specific dates and windows of time. These have been successful for the companyâs brands like Gucci, with whitelists filling up within hours. Another function still relatively limited in the NFT space but valuable to communities is making NFTs interoperable across platforms. This would mean that users could both use them on The Sandbox and play with them in games like Roblox, for example. With interoperability, there is a higher chance that buyers will purchase more NFTs to use them and display, strengthening the community across multiple platforms. Community also adds an element of exclusivity. There are now physical art galleries in Berlin that deny entry without a members-only NFT.Â âNFTs have literally become the passes allowing us to move between spaces,ï¿½?said Ian Rogers, chief experience officer at crypto hardware company Ledger and former chief digital officer at LVMH. Projects need to have a long-term vision Kering, owner of Gucci and Balenciaga, has in-house teams focused on digital innovation allowing it to explore freely within the space. While its risk-taking is not standard among luxuryâs âwait and seeï¿½?tribe ï¿½?luxury brands are typically slow adopters, when it comes to innovations like e-commerce ï¿½?its initial projects provide a model for brands looking to newly launch in the space or extend their current projects. For example, Gucciâs multiple NFT drops have been connected: Members that have purchased its NFTs in the past, like the Super Gucci collaboration with collectible company Superplastic released in January, are whitelisted. This is still new within the fashion space ï¿½?most NFT projects are not large enough yet to link separate projects. This idea of having a long-term NFT roadmap allows Kering space to develop its next idea while keeping its community involved through its Discord. Reward holding, rather than flipping, NFTs âWhat Bobby Hundreds is doing with the Adam Bomb Squad is the best example of [rewarding holding, rather than flipping, NFTs]. Heâs really trying to build a brand. Heâs not very friendly to the flippers; heâs actually been disappointed in a lot of people who wanted to buy low and sell high, and instead, heâs trying to create value for the members [who donât sell],ï¿½?Rogers said. As more NFT projects are launched, the flipping process has become a way to separate the community members who are loyal from those who arenât. Those who are in it for the long haul practice holding, seeing their NFTs as more than a cash grab, as new utilities emerge and creators reward their long-term holders. Rogers is one of the holders of an Adam Bomb Squad NFT. âIâm getting offers on my Adam Bomb Squad right now. I get them all day every day, but I never accept them. I have no intention to because, for me, thatâs a long-term community,ï¿½?he said. Creating this value usually comes from adding features the community appreciates, from offering physical experiences to adding NFT utilities. The Hundreds brand was one of the first to release an NFT in August 2021. Although it is not a typical luxury or fashion company, as a streetwear brand with a print magazine, its strength relies on an existing community that believes in the brand, similarly to Nike enthusiasts and Supreme fans. Its early members were able to cash in on a low NFT price, and early adopters saw themselves as the true community, with companies like Shopify later buying in when interest in the project peaked. Shopify used the NFT in a profile picture update on Twitter and has allowed NFTs to be sold and bought on its platform."

919,1,"iWOW Technology ends Catalist debut at S$0.26, up 4% from IPO price",647 words,Business Times Singapore,"As at 9.05 am, the counter was trading at S$0.28, up 12 per cent or S$0.03 from the IPO price. iWOW was also one of the most actively traded stocks on SGX in early trade, with some 2.3 million shares changing hands as at 9.08 am. As at 9.12 am, the counter had pared some gains from its opening price, with some 2.4 million shares traded. iWOW shares eventually ended the day at S$0.26, with a total of 15 million shares traded over the course of the day. iWOW had on Apr 6 launched its IPO, looking to sell a total of 26 million shares to raise gross proceeds of about S$6.5 million. This placement constitutes about 10.4 per cent of iWOW's enlarged share capital of 250.4 million shares. The company will have a theoretical market capitalisation of S$62.6 million after the placement, and a price-to-earnings ratio of 16.9 times. As at the close of placement at noon on Apr 12, all 26 million placement shares were validly subscribed for, with indications of interest received for some 78 million shares, meaning that the IPO was about 3 times subscribed. The group is notably one of the manufacturers of TraceTogether tokens. The company and electronics distributor Siix Singapore formed a consortium back in 2020, and went on to win one of the tenders to design and manufacture subsequent batches of the tokens. Another tender went to electronics manufacturer PCI. Apart from these tokens, iWOW's other products include smart-metering solutions to remotely monitor water and gas consumption, electronic monitoring devices for ex-offenders and accused persons, and alarm alert systems for the elderly. As at Mar 8, TraceTogether tokens accounted for 16.8 per cent or S$11.3 million of the group's S$67.4 million order book. Some S$54.2 million or 80.4 per cent of the order book comes from electronic monitoring systems. Smart-metering solutions constitute S$800,000, and alarm alert systems account for S$1.1 million. For FY2021 ended March, the group posted net profit of S$3.7 million - up from S$220,000 in FY2020. This was due largely to a spike in revenue to S$26.4 million from S$4.4 million in the year ago. TraceTogether tokens accounted for 81 per cent of FY2021's revenue. Some 19.2 per cent of the total IPO proceeds, or S$1.25 million, will be used to strengthen the group's research and development (R&D) capabilities to provide customisable IoT solutions; a further 15.4 per cent or S$1 million has been set aside to enlarge the company's customer base by engaging its existing B2B (business to business) customers and expanding offerings to the B2C (business to customers) segment. Another 7.7 per cent or S$500,000 of the IPO proceeds will be channelled into expanding the company's market reach into new countries such as Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the UAE. Other uses of IPO proceeds include investments and merger and acquisition activities, as well as working capital and listing expenses. Evolve Capital Advisory is the sponsor and issue manager of the IPO, while Futu Singapore is the underwriter and placement agent."

The Shanghai Disney Resort will close from Monday until further notice, officials said on Sunday, citing the COVID-19 situation. Including Shanghai infections, mainland China reported a total of 1,947 new locally transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms on Sunday, data from the National Health Commission showed, up from 1,656 a day earlier. The number of new local asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, stood at 2,384 up from 2,177 a day earlier. The death toll was unchanged at 4,638, with no new deaths.

976,0,Sweden tightens restrictions as virus surges,405 words,Agence France Presse,"The measures will come into force on Wednesday. Currently, vaccine passes are required for indoor events with more than 500 attending. But as of Wednesday, the maximum will be 500 people, with vaccine passes mandatory for any gathering over 50 people as well as required seating, a maximum of eight people per group, and at least one meter's distance between groups. ""Right now we are in a situation with record levels of transmission,"" Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told a press conference. Last week, the Nordic country registered several daily records of Covid cases, with a peak of 23,877 cases recorded on January 5, and the country's Public Health Agency also said the Omicron variant is now the dominant variant in Sweden. National Board of Health and Welfare director Olivia Wigzell on Monday noted that healthcare was already ""very strained,"" but warned that the delay between the increased spread and the need for care meant the situation would surely get worse. Adults were recommended to limit their social interactions and forego large dinners and parties, and a recommendation to work from home was reiterated. The Public Health Agency said it believed the measures would be necessary until the middle of February, but they would be re-evaluated every two weeks. Sweden made headlines in the early days of the pandemic when it, unlike most other countries, did not introduce any form of lockdown or school closures. Instead, it adopted a softer approach, recommending social distancing, homeworking and only limited use of facemasks. It did however ban visits to elderly care homes, limit the number of people allowed to attend public gatherings and restrict opening hours at bars and restaurants. Sweden's death toll -- around 15,300 of the 10.3 million population -- is around the European average. But it is significantly higher than those of its neighbours Norway, Finland and Denmark, which initially sparked heated debate about the Swedish strategy. jll/po/pvh"

230,0,"$50,000 per night? Luxury hotels steam ahead to defy tight times",901 words,AFR Online,"""In an acknowledgement of how tough things are right now, we decided to go ahead and launch with only 35 per cent of the hotel open,"" said Bruce Ryde, general manager of the Kimpton Margot Sydney. Mr Ryde has 60 of his 172 rooms open, and the restaurant, overseen by celebrity chef Luke Mangan, is open only three nights a week. ""We're hoping to be fully open in six weeks as we secure more staff,"" Mr Ryde said, adding that room rates were still holding steady, with lead-in rates for the Kimpton Margot Sydney currently sitting on $349 a night. ""People are happy to spend on a âfeel-good' hotel and there is pent-up demand,"" Mr Ryde said, while also acknowledging that many Australians, however, remained hesitant to return to cities for a staycation, especially with people still working from home. In the next few years, IHG's rival Accor will debut its plush Mondrian, 25hours and So/ brands in Australia, having recently ushered in the Movenpick brand with hotels in Melbourne and Hobart. At the Marriott stable, Spanish-founded brand AC by Marriott opens next month in Melbourne, while The Tasman opened in Hobart in December, comprising Australia's first Marriott Luxury Collection hotel. (Marriott also has W Sydney and the Ritz-Carlton Melbourne in the pipeline, albeit the timings could be affected by the collapse of Probuild.) The latest figures from STR property data solutions show Sydney and Melbourne lag other capitals in terms of occupancy recovery, with their indices only at 50 per cent of 2019 levels. But the future looks bright it seems. STR data shows that future hotel construction remains weighted to the nation's capital cities: 67 per cent of all hotel projects and 72 per cent of planned rooms are being built in the capitals. More than 35 per cent of those rooms will be in the luxury/upper upscale segment, says STR's Pacific regional manager, Matthew Burke, adding that luxury brands include the likes of W Hotel, InterContinental and the Ritz Carlton, while upper upscale takes in the Hilton, QT, MGallery by Sofitel, Pullman, Hotel Indigo and Westin. ""The biggest single growth category is from the âupscale' class, with 29 per cent of all rooms to this one class,"" Mr Burke said. This category includes independent hotels and major brands like Courtyard, Voco, Quest and Novotel. ""The majority of properties are of a higher class, as their target market is leisure and incentive travel,"" Mr Burke said. Figures compiled by Deloitte and presented at Thursday's Destination Australia conference in Melbourne show Australians are now spending more on hotels at $182 a night on average, up from $167 in 2019. As cities around Australia strive to revitalise and cash in on pent-up demand, hotels are moving fast to offer innovative packages, such as the Ovolo brand's Inchcolm Inn in Brisbane, which has partnered with Grey Goose Vodka to offer a $49,999 per night buy-out for 40 guests of the entire hotel to experience a ""night without compromise"", capitalising on rich travellers' desire for premium experiences with exclusive rights. In the past week alone, local Marriott Bonvoy hotels - including its upscale brands such as W, Westin and Four Points Sheraton - have had a 32 per cent increase in overseas bookings. Sydney-based veteran Accor senior executive, now Tourism Australia chairman, Michael Issenberg, will address the question of which market segments are roaring back at the AFR Business Summit[https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/exclusive-subscriber-offer-afr-business-summit-20211021-p59200] on Tuesday. ""As we pull out of the pandemic, the industry is watching for which segments are looking the best - leisure, business, luxury or the economy end,"" Mr Issenberg told The Australian Financial Review. ""Key to that is how many workers will return to our cities. Are people going to get back into the office on scale? Either way, what will that mean for business travel: will employees travel more or less for work now?"" While regional travel is booming, work remains to be done to get city hotels once again firing, Mr Issenberg said, adding ""the hotel culture of a city is key to its revitalisation"".  Sarah Derry, the newly appointed CEO of Accor Pacific (following the departure of Simon McGrath to Crown Sydney) confirmed Accor is also seeing strong growth in the top end of the market, and the brand has recently overhauled its Sofitel Adelaide hotel, and refreshed suites at Sofitel Melbourne. Events such as Mardi Gras in Sydney (which wraps up on Sunday), and Melbourne's Grand Prix from April 7-10 also spiked city hotel demand[https://www.afr.com/property/commercial/hotels-occupancy-could-hit-70-per-cent-by-year-end-hyatt-20220209-p59uyg]. Meanwhile, with the reopening of Western Australia's borders to travellers on Thursday, Flight Centre saw a substantial jump in website air bookings with flights to-and-from Perth, most notably departing from and arriving in Adelaide."

517,1,European shipbuilder plans defence expansion,297 words,New Ships,"Fincantieri did not give specific forecasts on 2022 results citing the uncertainty stemming from both geo-political tensions and high raw materials and energy prices. The group's executives however said that the core profit margin, which is an indicator of profitability, would remain high, after recovering to 7.4% last year. Last year, Fincantieri made a non-binding offer to buy Leonardo's OTO Melara and Wass companies, which make guns and torpedoes. At the same time, the shipbuilder has also considered buying ThyssenKrupp's submarine yard in partnership with Germany's Rheinmetall. ""Everything is suspended in the current scenario,"" General Manager Mr Fabio Gallia said, answering a question about the two potential deals. Excluding uncertainties connected to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as health concerns, the group said in a statement it could return to a ""sustainable dividend distribution starting from 2022""."

281,1,Auto insurance brought in $1.3 billion more than they paid out in 2020: Superintendent report,916 words,Postmedia Breaking News,"NDP Energy Critic Kathleen Ganley said Friday that insurance companies are making hundreds of millions more off the back of Alberta drivers with the help of UCP policies. Premier Jason Kenney scrapped a rate increase cap on auto insurers in 2019 after it was imposed by the previous NDP government. ""They were able to do this because the UCP removed the cap we put in place to limit increases to premiums,"" said Ganley. ""That's $385 million more out of the pockets of Alberta drivers in a single year. No wonder the UCP tried to hide the report before we call them out on it. No wonder they tried to bury it ahead of a long weekend."" The NDP has accused the government of attempting to suppress the superintendent's report for 2020 and 2021, saying it has been produced for more than 100 years. Ganley said the increases came during a year when many people parked their cars due to the pandemic and hardly drove. Despite that, they still saw rate increases, she said. ""Alberta drivers when you look at your car insurance bill, remember that you are getting worked over by an extremely profitable corporation with the help of the UCP,"" said Ganley. Kassandra Kitz, press secretary to Finance Minister Travis Toews, said that since much of the information in the report is publicly available elsewhere, the office of the superintendent had paused the release of the annual document while assessing if the report was still necessary. ""They have since taken action to continue the annual report publication,"" said Kitz in an email. Kitz said Albertans deserve an automobile insurance system that is fair, accessible and affordable and that is why the government is committed to examining ways to improve that system. She noted the government introduced Bill 41: the Insurance Amendment Act that changed regulations around how premiums are calculated. ""We introduced Bill 41 last session that made legislative and regulatory changes to stabilize auto insurance rates, enhance medical care benefits, and ensure more options and flexibility for drivers,"" said Kitz. She said seven insurers have filed for rate reductions in 2021 and that across the board, premium rates for private vehicles is down by just under one per cent over the past 12 months. An analysis using industry and regulator data before the report was released Thursday suggested insurance companies had raked in nearly $2.1-billion in profits during the COVID-19 pandemic. An analysis done by actuary Craig Allen that he says is based on figures provided by the Alberta Automobile Insurance Rate Board (AAIRB) shows auto insurers in 2020 pocketed $928 million in pre-tax profits and another $1.153 billion the following year. The 2021 figure, said Allen, is based on available numbers for the first half of that year and projections for the remainder. ""My estimate of what the profit's going to be is fairly conservative, cautious,"" he said. ""The COVID-19 pandemic and reduction in traffic certainly through the first half of 2021 that reduced the volume of accidents and claims is the real main driver."" The analysis was conducted for the group Fair Alberta which includes lawyers, medical professionals and injured Albertans. An insurance industry spokesman echoed the nearly 1 per cent rate decrease cited by Kitz, adding Allen's numbers are incomplete and skewed. He said it doesn't include more than $100 million in vehicle damage claims from the June 2020 hail storm that ravaged northeast Calgary and more vehicular traffic and probably more eventual payouts in the second half of last year. ""It's inappropriate to take a point in time and extrapolate it for an entire year...it's not necessarily accurate,"" said Aaron Sutherland, vice-president of the Insurance Bureau of Canada. He said it's illegal for insurance company profits to exceed 7 per cent so ""the notion we're making any kind of windfall is fanciful."" With inflation running at nearly 6 per cent and price increases of car parts and used vehicles far exceeding that, ""we're seeing a lot of pressure on pocketbooks but auto insurance isn't one of them."" He agreed many insurers' financial picture has improved recently but that some companies are doing considerably better than others. dshort@postmedia.com( mailto:dshort@postmedia.com ) BKaufmann@postmedia.com( mailto:BKaufmann@postmedia.com ) More news, fewer ads, faster load time: Get unlimited, ad-lite access to the Calgary Herald, Calgary Sun, National Post and 13 other Canadian news sites for just $14/month or $140/year.

935,0,Delhi: Private offices ordered to switch to work from home amid Covid surge,398 words,Financial Express Online,"The fresh restrictions will come into force with immediate effect and continue till further orders. The COVID-19 situation in Delhi was reviewed at a DDMA meeting on Monday under chairmanship of the Lt Governor in which Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was also present. ""It has been observed that numbers of COVID-19 cases (including the cases of Omicron variant) have been rapidly increasing over the last few days and positivity rate has crossed 23 percent,"" the order said. ""Therefore, it has been felt necessary that some more additional restrictions are required to be imposed in Delhi to contain the spread of COVID-19 virus, including the highly contagious and transmissible Omicron variant,"" stated the order. ""All private offices shall be closed, except those which are falling under the exempted category. The practice of work from home shall be followed. All restaurants and bars shall be closed. However, restaurants will be allowed only for home delivery/takeaway of food items,"" it stated. The exempted category of private offices including those of banks, companies providing essential services, insurance and mediclaim, pharma companies, offices of advocates, courier services, non banking financial corporations, security services, media, petrol pumps and oil and gas retail and storage outlets, among others, will be allowed to function with 100 percent staff. The DDMA had imposed a yellow alert in Delhi on December 28 after the Covid positivity rate remained above five percent for previous two consecutive days. Under yellow alert restrictions, private offices were allowed to function with 50 percent of staff attendance from 9 AM to 5 PM. Government offices in the city are currently working with 50 percent attendance.  The private offices, which were till now operating with 50 per cent work force, have been asked to follow the practice of work from home.

17,1,Young people do not meet profile of 43% of employers,462 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"Candidates who demonstrate experience and interest in developing empathy, coaching (receiving support to transform behaviors and beliefs) and resilience will stand out in interviews, says the report What workers want from the global firm. ""We are at a time when even the skills most in demand in the initial phase of the crisis are different from what employers require today and what is expected for the future,"" said Tania Arita, regional manager for Talent Solutions at ManpowerGroup. An ILO report on youth employability shows that training acquired in formal education tends to become obsolete faster. In addition, because there are not enough jobs, the skills of millions of young people are not being tapped, and instead positions are being filled with those who have only a few of the skills they need. Key skills The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has warned that Latin America has the world's largest gap between the skills available and those currently required. ""It is time to bring young people into the realm of employability,"" Arita stressed. This means that they should learn to train in transversal skills, i.e. those that are broadly transferable to different fields and not specific to one job, sector or discipline. In terms of competencies, it is key to want to ""learn to learn"", that the person is able to organize, process and retain information; to use time effectively and efficiently, without sacrificing quality, and to adapt to and complete assigned tasks. Another highly sought-after skill is ""problem solving,"" that is, thinking creatively, identifying and solving problems independently, and suggesting new ideas to get the job done. ""For the employer, a person demonstrating competencies of this type means that he or she will be better able to respond to changes in the workplace. Hence, it is important to develop these skills on the job or through self-training,"" said Arita. The best place to acquire these skills is on the job, but many employers are unwilling to hire without demonstrated competence in them. Therefore, individuals and schools need to become more involved in acquiring these skills, he emphasized."

Also, operating profit before tax (Ebit) fell by 10% due to provisions on Russia, where it has ceased its business, and increased spending on research for a total of 4.8 billion Swedish kronor (466 million euros). The Swedish firm has provisioned SEK 900 million (ï¿½?7 million) for the cessation of activities in the country presided over by Vladimir Putin. In 2021, it turned over 4.1 billion kronor (398 million euros) in this state, which, due to its size, requires extensive network coverage. The network division continues to be the Swedish company's big revenue generator with 40.7 billion kronor in revenue (ï¿½?.952 billion), up 12% on the same period in 2021, although margins fell by 1.2 points to 44.8% points. This is due, according to the company, to a large contract and measures to avoid supply shortages. Meanwhile, the digital services division posted revenue of SEK7.2 billion (almost EUR700 million), up 5%, while the managed services division posted revenue of SEK4.9 billion (EUR475 million), a 2% growth in reported, but a 5% drop in organic.

580,0,Iconic Somerville bakery is not closing,882 words,The Boston Globe,"âLyndell's Bakery is in proceedings for demolition,"" said the message, shared in a group for Somerville residents called âDavis Square"" that has more than 6,000 members. The blurb quickly led to an avalanche of online speculation, with fans of the bakery, part of the city's fabric for more than a century, alarmed over what it could mean. Were they closing up shop for good? Getting pushed out by higher rents? In the middle of another pandemic winter, it was hard not to fear the worst. âThis needs to be stopped,"" read one of the 189 comments. âThis feels like my parents getting divorced all over again,"" another person responded. But members of the Ball Square District Association, which represents the neighborhood and businesses along Broadway where Lyndell's is located, dispelled rumors about the institution's imminent demise following the rumblings on social media this week. While the building's owner, DiCamillo Associates LLC, is hoping to redevelop the property at some point, Lyndell's isn't getting tossed out like day-old baked goods. âLyndell's Bakery is not for sale, is not closing, and I expect to continue to be the 100% owner for a very long time,"" Bill Galatis, who has owned Lyndell's for 22 years, wrote in an e-mail to the neighborhood association that was posted online. âPlease disregard any comments that are on social media. These people simply don't know the facts."" The hubbub over Lyndell's, which on major holidays draws a line of customers that snakes around the block before it even opens its doors, stemmed from a recent hearing notice from the city's Historic Preservation Commission. Buried in the agenda for its Jan. 25 meeting is a request to âdemolish principal structure"" at 720 Broadway, where Lyndell's sells its famous pies, cookies, and pastries. There's also an application for an adjacent property, at 722 Broadway, by the same owner. The budget item ï¿½?listed under âDeterminations of Historic Significance"" ï¿½?is described by the commission as âStep 1 in the demolition review process."" But in an interview, Galatis said the hearing doesn't mean Lyndell's is saying goodbye to its home in Ball Square ï¿½?not by a long shot. âLyndell's is going nowhere,"" he said. As Ball Square gears up for the opening of a new Green Line station, the building's owners are seeking to redevelop the property, Galatis said. âWe have been working collaboratively with the landlord, and he did discuss with me that he was thinking about redeveloping the building and some other properties he has on the block, and he said, 'Listen, our long-term goal is to put Lyndell's back in there,""' said Galatis, the fourth owner of the bakery, which is celebrating its 135th year in business. But as speculation swirled about Lyndell's fate, customers grew worried. Some called the bakery to find out if it was closing, or asked about it when they stopped in for cannoli and muffins. To quell concerns, Galatis reiterated the bakery's intentions in a post on Facebook. âPeople get nervous when they hear about iconic, longtime businesses shutting down because of redevelopment or COVID,"" he said. âBut in the end, if the location is redeveloped, then Lyndell's will be in a much better place and be able to offer customers even more."" If redevelopment plans eventually move ahead, Lyndell's would need to temporarily relocate to somewhere nearby in Ball Square, Galatis said. Once work on their current building wrapped up, they'd move back into an upgraded bakery with more space and possibly indoor seating. âThat's going to be the plan. I believe that we are going to work collaboratively [with the landlord] to build a brand new, and maybe even larger, Lyndell's,"" he said. Joseph Fodera, managing partner of DiCamillo Associates, said it's long been the plan to redevelop the property, with Lyndell's at the center of the project. The goal is to build âa mixed-use residential and retail space,"" he said, âand Lyndell's will be occupying the retail space, as they do now."" Fodera, a Somerville native who grew up going to Lyndell's, said the upcoming hearing with the Historic Preservation Commission is the first step in what could be a long process. In the end, he envisions an outcome that will benefit not only Ball Square, but also the bakery and its customers. âWe don't know how much or what we can build there yet, but I can tell you it's going to be better than it is now,"" he said. âWe want to give them a state-of-the-art facility where they can thrive for the next 135 years.""

259,0,"In Stewart O'Nan's 'Ocean State,' mean girls turn deadly",929 words,Washington Post.com,"""Ocean State"" opens with this shocking line: ""When I was in eighth grade my sister helped kill another girl."" Even with the killer's identity revealed, much remains tantalizingly hidden but only for a few pages. The full horror of the crime is soon revealed: The victim was a popular high school student. The two girls were fighting over a boy. Disclosing these material details before the crime is reenacted in the novel, before the police investigation uncovers the truth and before the trial produces a verdict, O'Nan has purposefully drained the tension from this tragedy. What's left for us in ""Ocean State"" are doleful reflections on various characters' motives and reactions. It's a gamble. The novel's first narrator, Marie, introduces us to her poor family in Rhode Island. Her pretty sister, the teenage murderer, goes by the exceedingly ironic name ""Angel."" Their mother is a nurse's aide with one talent: ""finding new boyfriends."" That ensures a precarious life for the family. ""My mother's boyfriends tried to be sweet, but they were strangers,"" Marie says in her poignant, retrospective voice. ""Sometimes they paid our rent and sometimes we split it. When they broke up with my mother ï¿½?suddenly, drunkenly, their shouting jerking us from sleep ï¿½?we would have to move again. Like her, we were always rooting for things to work out, far beyond where we should have."" As usual, O'Nan writes about financially stressed people with a clear and empathetic sense of the constant pressures they endure. Their plight is well represented by Marie and Angel's 42-year-old mother. When she discovers that the latest man she's dating lives in ""an active adult community"" ï¿½?that is, a retirement home ï¿½?she feels humiliated but also excited by the chance for stability. ""Is it wrong to want something better than where they are?"" she wonders. ""It's not like she could ever afford it herself. How many chances like this will she get?"" Perhaps if she hadn't been so focused on manufacturing a romance with her geriatric beau, she might have noticed what her daughter Angel was up to. But maybe not. As Marie notes, ""My sister seemed to move through an underworld of secrets, the hidden currents of desire."" Indeed, that underworld of clandestine teenage desire is the ostensible subject of ""Ocean State."" O'Nan spends much of the novel shuttling between Angel and her nemesis, Birdy Alves. They're both sleeping with Myles, a good-looking senior from a wealthy family. He's savvy enough to try to keep his relationship with Birdy on the down-low, but when photos of them sneaking around slip out on social media, their classmates turn sharply against her. And then Angel lashes out. High school girls fighting over and even killing for the affections of a boy make this an inherently gripping plot. But O'Nan's approach is ï¿½?pardon the word ï¿½?deadly. Two-thirds of the novel are spent chronicling teenage angst and school-hall drama without the verve necessary to make this story pump with authentic adolescent energy. O'Nan's careful, sepia-toned observations offer no satirical wit on the machinations of horny teenagers nor any chilling insight on the horrors that sexual desire can activate. Instead, we get a lot of passages like this: ""Myles hangs out front between the pillars with Ryan and his crew. Birdy knows his schedule by heart, smiles to herself each time she passes his locker. All morning, sitting in class, watching the rain fall on the tennis courts and the soccer field, she pictures their room at the beach, but then, after lunch, he texts to let her know he has to cancel. No explanation, just sry."" Such generalized prose relies on us already knowing how Ryan and his cocky crew pose with studied nonchalance, how pandemonium breaks out in the hall of lockers between classes, and especially how a savvy girl suspends the knowledge that the object of her devotion is a cad. At this late date, after so many comedies, dramas, mysteries and thrillers about high school romances, double-dealing jocks, vicious mean girls and toxic social media platforms, we're deeply familiar with the tropes of the genre. But for that very reason, we don't particularly need a novel that feels so unwilling to tell us something we haven't already heard. Even the act of murder itself is politely obscured in these pages, and the trial that takes place late in the story does so largely offstage. More than a decade ago, O'Nan published ""Songs for the Missing,"" a devastating story about parents crushed by the endless search for their 18-year-old daughter. No one who read that relentlessly static tragedy will ever forget it. But this new novel, about the loss of another teenage girl under circumstances that are so much more dramatic, leaves little impact at all. Sry.

109,0,Tourism blow as $800m Sydney CBD hotel knocked back,836 words,The Australian - Online,"The hospitality industry is making a slow recovery in cities after the pandemic and is dealing with a spike in Covid-19 cases due to a new variant but has called for more new hotels to be open so the country remains competitive. Sydney has seen few city hotels open and the W Hotel announced for the Ribbon development in Darling Harbour in mid-2018 has been beset by delays with the collapse of two builders, Grocon and Probuild. Another mooted CBD hotel site in Bligh Street is now being sold off as a revamped office block. Prior to the pandemic, local group Fortius and Singapore-based SC Capital explored pre-selling a proposed $700m hotel and office block on the property. Built and Irongate proposed a redevelopment that would have seen a luxury hotel mixed use project rise at 52 Phillip Street and the adjacent heritage-listed building at 50 Phillip Street. The plan hinged on Builtâs unsolicited proposal to the NSW government for the leasehold purchase of 50 Phillip Street. It was submitted in 2017 and had gone to the second stage by October 2019 with the developers amending plans for the sensitive site where the hotel would adjoin the historic Chief Secretaryâs Building. But their proposal was quietly knocked back last year, prompting surprise after the same state process had previously been used to allow Crownâs casino complex at Barangaroo and Macquarieâs office towers above Martin Place metro station without tenders. The proponents had worked closely with the government to craft their project around the areaâs unique heritage elements and gained significant support from inside the government up to former premier Gladys Berejiklian, who had declared it needed to happen to show that Sydney was open to the world. But the quiet decision to reject the proposal effectively ended its hopes, leaving the developers with estimated costs of close to $5m and the international investors behind the project, as well as a trio of global hoteliers who were vying to run the project, hanging. The proponents have declined to comment publicly on the project but there are concerns that hotel chains will be deterred from committing to Sydney due to planning uncertainty and international real estate investors may also factor in greater sovereign risk when investing in NSW. An Investment NSW spokesperson said: âThe proposal was assessed in accordance with the criteria set out for unsolicited proposals by the NSW government. It did not proceed past Stage 2 of the process.ï¿½?Industry players suggested the premier held concerns about the heritage considerations in the district as the hotel and residences would border the Chief Secretaryâs Building but it was to be protected under the scheme. A 2021 report by former prime minister Paul Keating and former Sydney lord mayor Lucy Turnbull, who were commissioned by the NSW government to review how the area known as Macquarie Street East, has influenced planning around the area. They argued the precinct should be revitalised into a world-class cultural destination on par with New York and London and the Chief Secretaryâs Building should be returned to its original purpose as a government office. Builtâs plans had included careful heritage preservation and adaptive re-use of 50 Phillip Street, drawing on the firmâs unique skills in such projects and tapping heritage specialist Graham Brooks to advise. The developer has a record in developing heritage projects including Sub Station No. 164 at 185 Clarence Street and is also delivering the redevelopment of the former Education and Lands buildings on Bridge Street. The project had included 240 hotel rooms, a rooftop pool and 16 luxury hotel-branded residences. The federal government has been campaigning on the opening of international borders and state governments have declared that cities are open with hotels a key part of that strategy. Some are opening up. The countryâs first Kimpton Hotel opened in Sydney last month, ahead of an expected national roll out of the luxury branded hotel chain, after new owner Pro-Invest picked up the hotel from Chinaâs Greenland Group. The Shenzhen-based owners of One Circular Quay are also readying to launch an apartment project, with a penthouse priced at more than $100m, and a luxury Waldorf Astoria Â­Hotels and Resorts in the adjoining tower on the former Goldfields House site. The Bligh Street site now being sold as a $200m office block via McVay Real Estate and JLL had been billed as a 421-room hotel."

901,0,Verifiers ask YouTube for measures against disinformation,369 words,EFE News Service,"They urged Wojcicki to implement at least four measures, including a commitment to transparency on how disinformation travels on the platform and publicly disclose its policies to address it, including the use of artificial intelligence. Rather than deleting videos, fact-checkers are asking YouTube to focus on providing the proper context, which they believe can be done by ""establishing meaningful and structured collaboration"" with fact-checking organizations. Signatories said they reject what they consider YouTube's attempts to frame the entire debate as ""a false choice"" between deleting videos or not and say that ""the available evidence"" shows providing verified information is more effective than removing content. In this way, ""freedom of expression is preserved while mitigating the risks of harm to life, health, security and democratic processes."" Another request is that the platform act against repeat offenders who constantly produce content marked as disinformation and ""prevent their videos from being recommended or promoted by the company's algorithms."" They urged that these efforts be expanded to languages ??other than English and that country- and language-specific data be provided, as well as effective transcription services. The verifiers said in their letter they want to engage with YouTube to put these demands into practice and that the platform really does everything possible to prevent misinformation and false information from becoming ""weapons against its users and society in general.""

272,0,Don't forget the nightlife industry,745 words,Bangkok Post,"Perhaps buoyed by this announcement, the CCSA has even gone as far as announcing it will soon stop its daily updates of Covid-19 infections and focus only on new clusters. While this is good news for most, it's doubtful the nightlife industry is celebrating as it's been dealt a serious blow by the pandemic. Although some bars are now back in operation at a limited capacity after acquiring ""proper"" licences, there remains no clear policy as to when establishments can return to business as usual. Some are worried of the negative long-term effects these closures will have on Thailand's appeal as a lively and fun destination. While it is important to be cautious and minimise risk, if we are to accept life with Covid, should we not also stop living in fear? Visit any popular restaurant and take note of how many safety measures are being skirted. Early in the pandemic, the premise for a ban on alcohol sales was that it enabled risky behaviour, but with booze now flowing freely in some restaurants, is the risk of spread at 12am greater than at 11pm? Or is this a move to rein in on what some consider ""immoral behaviour""? Given that some nightlife establishments also now require a negative antigen-test kit result to enter, once the peak of this current wave subsides, a clear set of guidelines should be provided on when nightlife can return to full capacity. Besides the continued ban on fun, the process of entering the country under the Test & Go Programme or sandbox destinations also requires a rethink as it has made trips to the kingdom expensive and riddled with uncertainty. A family trip in which each member is required to undergo costly RT-PCR tests despite being fully vaccinated and having a negative test result prior to arrival is eating away at Thailand's competitive advantage as a cost-effective destination. After a strong debut in November, a new rule was added months later to Test & Go which required tourists to undergo an RT-PCR test on day five as well (Test & Go Version 2). This came at a time when the country was already seen as not having a clear policy after ditching the ""Certificate of Entry"" for the ""Thailand Pass"", both of which have had onerous requirements and have seen some people wait weeks for approval (while others, a mere few hours). The decision to make Test & Go stricter (the second PCR requirement has been dropped now in favour of self-reporting an ATK test result on day five) during the height of the tourism season was a poor decision as early data had already indicated Omicron was milder and nearly impossible to keep out. With most people ready to move on with life, online travel platform Expedia's head Peter Kern has predicted that summer 2022 will be one of the busiest travel seasons ever. Countries in the European Union, the US, and Australia in recent weeks have moved to ease pandemic-era travel barriers, ease entry restrictions and drop mask mandates. With most people unable to travel in the past two years, experts are expecting pent-up demand. Although May-September is traditionally the low season in Thailand, entry regulations should be evaluated and further eased to restore the country's tourist-friendly reputation if it wants to tap into the lucrative market it has become accustomed to over the past decade. At this stage, Covid-19 and Omicron are here to stay. If we are to truly ditch the Covid-zero policy of previous years, forcing tourists to test upon entry when local spread has been established is counterintuitive. Furthermore, not forcing people to rack up hospital bills and chase insurance companies to pay for expensive stays after testing positive for a mild case, when home isolation will suffice, will help us move on from this pandemic."

Could it be because growing up on social media has diminished their ability to tell real from fake? You canât really blame them, when even some of the most absurd fake news that is published has the carefully designed look of truth. On top of which, most of us are indulging in fake news about ourselves on a fairly constant basis, in the form of doctored pictures, staged personal moments and overblown announcements about our lives and careers. Not to mention the fake followers [https://www-prweek-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/article/1590362/majority-uk-instagram-influencers-engage-fakery-landmark-new-study] that some users, influencers and businesses purchase to pump up their online presence. The culture of social media has normalised fakeness at a time when authenticity is supposedly so prized. Itâs disheartening as well as ironic that some people laughed at the women who fell victim to the Tinder Swindler, Shimon Hayut ï¿½?or Simon Leviev as he was known to his victims ï¿½?and called them âdumbï¿½?for falling for his professions of love and promises of marriage.

It was the lifestyle they themselves longed to have, and managed to get through scamming their marks. Watching their stories unfold reminded me of something said to me by Nick Prugo, one of the members of the Bling Ring [https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/share/e9cc0cc3-dbf1-4fab-8367-5fc7c05608e6], a group of teenage thieves who, in 2008 and 2009, robbed the homes of celebrities including Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan, and whose story I covered for Vanity Fair. âItâs the lifestyle that everybody kind of wants,ï¿½?Prugo said. This actually wasnât always the case, but for many people, it is now ï¿½?even more so with the pressure people feel from social media and its constant promotion of the lavish lifestyles of influencers. Studies have shown that people compare their own, less affluent lives to the likes of Kim Kardashian [https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/comparing-ourselves-to-others-comparison-culture-research-self-esteem-instagram-social-media-success-careers-fitness-relationships/345725] and feel low self-esteem because of it; young people are especially vulnerable. But, in a vicious cycle, that decrease in self-esteem only seems to feed a stronger thirst: a 2019 study reported that Gen Z considers wealth and fame even more important [https://www-marketwatch-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/story/move-over-millennials-this-generation-is-even-more-obsessed-with-fame-and-fortune-2019-06-26] to their lives than millennials, who have long been the poster children for these obsessions. There are more shows about scammers to come; Hollywood seems to have deemed our appetite insatiable. The most recent is Huluâs The Dropout [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7rlZLw9m10], a miniseries starring Amanda Seyfried as the Theranos fraudster, Elizabeth Holmes, which premiered earlier this month. Holmes, convicted of criminal fraud in January, is awaiting sentencing; Delvey spent nearly four years in prison and is now in US immigration custody for overstaying her visa. But Leviev is running around free ï¿½?he was even still on Tinder until The Tinder Swindler came out and the dating service finally kicked him off ï¿½?and wants to tell his side of the story. No doubt somebody in Hollywood will want to hear it. And maybe we will, too. * Nancy Jo Sales is a writer at Vanity Fair and the author of American Girls: Social Media and the Secret Lives of Teenagers and The Bling Ring"

Benefit Street alleged that the owners have improperly diverted hotel revenue, occupancy taxes and payments from the Paycheck Protection Program, a government relief plan for small businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic, from the hotel to affiliate entities. The lender also said the owners were unwilling to work with the court-appointed examiner to investigate funds transferred to other entities and out of creditors' reach. Representatives for 96 Wythe Acquisition LLC, the entity behind the hotel, did not respond to requests for comment. It has argued in court that the owners have acted appropriately and that they have been cooperating with the examiner. Benefit Street, which provided a $68 million mortgage loan to the owners in 2017, complained in the objection that the lender ""will not receive a penny of principal"" for six years and ""will receive interest only at a well-below-market rate."" The interest-only loan would mature in six years under the plan rather than 18 months as was initially agreed to, the lender said. Meanwhile, the lender's claim against the hotel owners will soon exceed $95 million including interest accrued since the alleged default in late 2018, court papers show. The borrowers stopped paying monthly interest in December 2018, and the loan matured in June 2019 without repayment, according to court papers. The owners filed for chapter 11 protection[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/williamsburg-hotel-is-latest-bankruptcy-in-battered-new-york-lodging-industry-11614127735?mod=article_inline] in February last year to avoid foreclosure. The filing was initially opposed by the U.S. Trustee, urging the court to convert it to a chapter 7 liquidation because it said 96 Wythe Acquisition needed independent oversight as it didn't disclose its connection to an affiliate that manages the hotel. But Judge Drain said he was aware of the arrangement[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/brooklyns-williamsburg-hotel-owners-approved-to-press-forward-with-restructuring-plan-11633554842], which he said is common in the hospitality industry, and he allowed the case to continue as a chapter 11.

595,0,The on-premises restaurants may close in February*** TRANSLATED ***,568 words,STT,"The National Institute for Health and Welfare(THL) has recommended their complete exclusion. The facility has classified bars, pubs and nightclubs as high-risk events for coronary infections. On the other hand, according to the department, food and staff restaurants are places with a low risk of infection. Minister of Economic Affairs Mika LintilÃ¤(center) announced the start of preparations on Friday. According to the minister, the government is very united that low-risk restaurants should not be subject to further restrictions. The closure would not materialize immediately. - It will probably talk about a three- to four-week timeline, because then Parliament will decide the law in due course, LintilÃ¤ said. The operation of the restaurants is already heavily regulated, as all restaurants will have to close in the evening and their customer numbers will be limited. Despite THL's recommendation, a total ban on liquor restaurants alone has been considered difficult by the government. Doubts have been raised about the specification of restaurants by law. The law will be prepared in co-operation between the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. The latter has wanted to close all restaurants. The support pot could be over 200 million It was also announced at the event that the government is preparing a closure fee and a new round of cost subsidies for companies affected by various corona measures. The closure compensation would currently apply, for example, to sports and sports facilities that have been closed by an official decision. The cost support for companies subject to less restrictive restrictions would be the sixth in a row. There is also an event guarantee under construction that would allow for the planning of summer events. At the moment, Finland could only grant the guarantee until the end of June, but according to LintilÃ¤, the government intends to apply to the European Commission for permission to extend the guarantee until the end of September. The government is due to submit a bill on the support package to Parliament in early February. According to LintilÃ¤, the exact size of the compensation will only be decided when the duration of the various closures and restrictions is specified. He said tentatively that the total amount of aid could be between ï¿½?200 and ï¿½?250 million. Labor market support for entrepreneurs again Due to interest rate restrictions, the government will continue to exempt entrepreneurs from labor market support. Thus, labor market support can be paid to the entrepreneur again, even if the entire business does not cease. Minister of Labor Tuula Haatainen(sd.) Spoke about the matter. This has also been done in the past during the corona epidemic. We also want to eliminate the deductible at the beginning of unemployment again, said Minister of Social Affairs and Health Hanna Sarkkinen(left). Unemployment insurance normally has a deductible for the first five days, during which no daily allowance is paid. Both exemptions would be valid from January to February. The aim is to submit the government's proposals to Parliament as soon as possible, the ministers said. *** DISCLAIMER: THIS IS AN AUTOMATED TRANSLATION FROM FINNISH ***"
650,1,Delta expects leaner workforce following post-Covid hiring spree,697 words,Atlanta Business Chronicle Online,"March profitability could be followed by an almost full recovery by this summer. The company predicts by June, its total revenue will be at least 93% of what it was in June 2019. Delta also foresees a full-year profit by the end of December. Delta is a bellwether for Atlanta's broader aviation and hospitality industries, which includes thousands of small businesses. Business travel, which has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, is a major indicator of that recovery[https://www-bizjournals-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/atlanta/news/2021/03/25/sbbm-threat-delta-small-businesses.html]. âOur crystal ball is only as good as the next 60 or 90 days ï¿½?of bookings on hand,ï¿½?Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in an April 13 earnings call. âAnd the next 60 to 90 days looks good.ï¿½?Delta still has almost 10,000 fewer employees than the end of 2019, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The airline started shedding employees through early retirement and voluntary separation programs starting in April 2020, cutting the workforce down to about 74,000 people[https://www-sec-gov.proxy.library.nyu.edu/Archives/edgar/data/0000027904/000002790421000003/dal-20201231.htm#i9e520fbc9e094b64b139dd151a560bbf_88]. About 5,700 of those workers were in Atlanta as of 2020, according to financial filings. Bastian said the company anticipated a surge in travel this summer, and spent the last 18 months hiring ahead of the demand. While short of where it was pre-pandemic, Delta's headcount is unlikely to change much in the months ahead, he said during the earnings call. This year alone, the airline has hired 4,000 people, Bastian said. In 2021, the airline hired more than 11,000 people but still had to cancel flights during the end-of-the-year travel rush because of staffing shortages caused by the omicron variant. ""Weâre largely where we need to be for staffing,ï¿½?Bastian said. Delta is metro Atlanta's second-largest employer, according to the Atlanta Business Chronicle[https://www-bizjournals-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/atlanta/subscriber-only/2021/07/16/atlantas-25-largest-employers.html], and one of the largest employers in the city of Atlanta. There were about 650 positions open on its website[https://delta.avature.net/careers]. Last month, Delta announced a 4% pay increase for employees worldwide, which will take effect this May. The airline is now a âskills-firstï¿½?company[https://news.delta.com/equity-motive-deltas-skills-first-approach-aims-increase-frontline-access-higher-earning-career], meaning it doesnât require college degrees for most positions. That approach is becoming more common among technology corporations[https://www-bizjournals-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/atlanta/news/2021/05/26/microsoft-job-training-accelerate-atlanta.html] that want to increase and diversify their applicant pools. Delta is testing an internal apprenticeship program for roles in human resources, revenue management, information technology and finance. Through a partnership with Georgia State University, Delta has developed a three-semester program to help people join its analytics teams. Those training programs are part of Deltaâs equity commitment, in which the company aims to open more positions to more people. It doesnât relate to the staffing shortages, a company representative said. Offices reopening, loosened travel restrictions and a strong spring break performance indicate a rising demand for flights, according to Delta. Corporate domestic flights recovered about 50% from 2019 during the first three months of the year but that jumps to 70% for March alone. International business flights show a similar trend ï¿½?about 35% recovered for the quarter and 50% recovered for March. Premium domestic tickets are fully recovered, according to the company. Amid the passenger slowdown, Delta has increased its cargo business. Revenue from that unit was about $289 million for the quarter, which is up about 50% from 2019. Increases in jet fuel costs have slowed Deltaâs recovery. Prices are up 33% in three months, according to the financial results. The airline is working to cut costs in other areas to accommodate for those price hikes. Did you find this article useful?

835,0,Spotify to link virus content to Covid facts after disinformation row,543 words,Agence France Presse,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have also flagged concerns over misinformation on Spotify's platform, but reiterated their commitment to continue using it to publish their content. ""We are working to add a content advisory to any podcast episode that includes a discussion about Covid-19,"" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said in a statement. ""This advisory will direct listeners to our dedicated Covid-19 Hub, a resource that provides easy access to data-driven facts, up-to-date information as shared by scientists, physicians, academics and public health authorities around the world, as well as links to trusted sources,"" Ek said. The ""new effort to combat misinformation"" would roll out in the next few days, he added. Rogan, 54, has discouraged vaccination in young people and promoted the off-label use of the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin to treat the virus. The podcaster, who has a $100-million (90 million euros) multi-year exclusive deal with Spotify, was kept on, and Spotify complied with Young's demand and started removing his catalogue of songs. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex raised concerns over misinformation on the platform, but said they were ""committed to continuing"" their lucrative content deal despite ""concerns"". ""We have continued to express our concerns to Spotify to ensure changes to its platform are made to help address this public health crisis,"" said a spokesperson for Archewell, the Duke and Duchess' organisation, in a statement. ""We look to Spotify to meet this moment and are committed to continuing our work together as it does."" Spotify voiced ""regret"" over Young's move but cited a need to balance ""both safety for listeners and freedom for creators"". Spotify's move drew applause online from organisations including video-streaming platform Rumble, which credited the Swedish company with ""defending creators"" and standing ""up for free speech"". But Young, 76, also garnered wide praise for taking a stand, including from the World Health Organization chief. The musician also urged fellow artists to follow his lead, and calls for boycotts and cancelled subscriptions flourished on social media. ""Based on the feedback over the last several weeks, it's become clear to me that we have an obligation to do more to provide balance and access to widely-accepted information from the medical and scientific communities guiding us through this unprecedented time,"" Ek said. In addition, Ek said the company would publish its ""Platform Rules"", which include guidelines for creators on what Spotify labels ""dangerous"" and ""deceptive"" content. In recent years, online media titans including Facebook and YouTube have come under fire for allowing conspiracy theorists to spread their views. But despite its explosive growth, podcasting has largely flown under the radar. jll-map/gw/to"

626,1,The Secretary of Energy convened Public Hearings to update electricity and gas tariffs,761 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"Tariffs: the IMF announced that subsidies will decrease 0.6% and there will be a public hearing in April. In addition, the 10% of residential users of gas and electricity services with the highest payment capacity in society will no longer receive the energy subsidy benefit. Thus, for most residential users, excluding those who benefit from the social tariff, electricity bills will be corrected by an average of 17%. Former minister of Macri warned that there will be a lack of gas for two years and put numbers to the energy imbalance. In the case of gas, the average correction for most of the country's users will be around 21.5%, with slight variations depending on the regions. What are the next stepsThe Secretary of Energy with the respective resolutions (RS-235/2022 and RS-237/2022), established the call for the Public Hearings, which will make these mechanisms and tariff updates known and available for the consideration of the users. It should be noted that these hearings will especially consider the situation of vulnerable sectors and those with lower payment capacity, within the margins defined therein, and that they will be governed by the principle of gradualness. With this step, the tariff updating process defined by the National Government in the economic program begins, aiming at achieving reasonable tariff levels and susceptible of being applied with criteria of justice and distributive equity for gas and electricity public utilities, official sources remarked. How Argentines fight inflation, who is to blame and what solution they propose They also emphasized that this is a process that will be governed according to criteria and guidelines of graduality and proportionality established in the National Constitution and indicated by the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation. Thus, the tariff update will be promoted, after a public hearing, with a scheme aimed at protecting the most vulnerable sectors and those with lower payment capacity, and at the same time encouraging the adoption of measures that promote the rational use of services and the reduction of the environmental impact. For residential users, a tariff correction related to the evolution of their income, represented by the coefficient of salary variation (CVS), will be considered as an objective criterion, as established in Law No. 27,443, which was frustrated by the total veto imposed by the previous administration. For 90% of residential users, this mechanism guarantees that tariff updates will always be lower than their salary increases, implying corrections in their bills lower than the increase in their income in real terms, with the purpose of protecting real income and improving the distributive aspect of the subsidy policy. This is how the update scheme wasIn this way, the Government is considering a tariff scheme for the 2022-2023 biennium, which contemplates three levels: ?social tariff. Gas users benefiting from the social tariff, for whom there will be no further increase in their bill this year, and for the next calendar year, such correction will be equivalent to 40% of the CVS of the previous year. For electricity social tariff beneficiaries, the new tariff correction for 2022 will not exceed 6%. Rest of the users. The total increase in the bill for each calendar year will be equivalent to 80% of the Salary Variation Coefficient (CVS) corresponding to the previous year. Based on this scheme, for 2022 and considering the tariff update carried out last March, the proposed increase for June will be an average of 17% for electricity tariffs for AMBA users, and an average of 21.5% over the current value of the bill for gas users throughout the country. The exact variations will vary according to each residential rate category and also the region for gas users. Higher income users. The 10% of users with the highest income and with full payment capacity will no longer be beneficiaries of the energy consumption subsidy."

850,0,Spotify removing Neil Young's music after rocker's Rogan ultimatum,500 words,Agence France Presse,"On Wednesday he published a second letter to his website, thanking his record company, Warner's Reprise Records for their support ""in the name of truth."" He said Spotify accounts for 60 percent of his music's global streaming income Young has deemed the stand worth it: ""Spotify has become the home of life threatening COVID misinformation,"" he wrote. ""Lies being sold for money."" ""I realized I could not continue to support SPOTIFY's life threatening misinformation to the music loving public."" His music was expected to come down within hours Wednesday evening, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported that the removal was confirmed. Young had 2.4 million followers and over six million monthly listeners on the popular streaming platform. Rogan has a multi-year exclusive deal with Spotify, reportedly to the tune of $100 million, and a massive following. But critics say his podcast is a platform for peddling conspiracy theories and disinformation, particularly over Covid-19. Rogan has discouraged vaccination in young people and promoted the off-label use of the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin to treat the virus. In a statement widely available across US media Spotify said Wednesday that ""we want all the world's music and audio content to be available to Spotify users. With that comes great responsibility in balancing both safety for listeners and freedom for creators. We have detailed content policies in place and we've removed over 20,000 podcast episodes related to Covid since the start of the pandemic."" ""We regret Neil's decision to remove his music from Spotify,"" the service said, ""but hope to welcome him back soon."" Young's move followed the publication in December of an open letter from 270 doctors, physicians and professors to Spotify, asking the service to ""moderate misinformation on its platform."" ""It is a sociological issue of devastating proportions and Spotify is responsible for allowing this activity to thrive on its platform,"" read the letter. It's not the first time the ""Rockin' In The Free World"" singer has removed his music from Spotify. In 2015 he did so after citing sound-quality issues. In his latest missive, Young again blasted Spotify's sound, saying the company ""continues to peddle the lowest quality in music production. So much for art."" ""But now that is in the past for me,"" he wrote, recommending a number of other platforms that stream his music in high-resolution. ""Soon my music will live on in a better place."" mdo/caw"

Not both.ï¿½?Young said Roganâs podcast was spreading âfalse informationï¿½?about Covid-19 vaccines that was âpotentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by themï¿½? The Independent contacted Spotify for comment."
85,0,Burger King says Russia operator 'refused' to shutter restaurants,455 words,Reuters News,"Kolobov said in a statement to Reuters that he does not have the authority or power to decide whether to suspend restaurant operations. Shear's long letter and Kolobov's response highlight the many complications bedeviling some American fast-food brands as they try to halt operations in Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. It also exposes what can become a point of weakness in international franchising, which is how most American restaurant brands expand overseas: the relationships with their independent operators. On March 8, Starbucks Corp and a wave of other companies followed McDonald's Corp in saying they would suspend or limit operations in Russia. Like Burger King , Starbucks does not own or operate its more than 100 cafes there. But unlike Burger King , it had a willing partner - Kuwait-based Alshaya Group - that immediately agreed to shut its Starbucks ' locations in Russia and support its 2,000 employees.  Restaurant Brands entered Russia a decade ago through a joint venture partnership with three entities: Kolobov, who controls day-to-day operations, private equity and asset management firm Investment Capital Ukraine, and Russia's state-owned VTB Bank , which has been hit by Western sanctions.  Restaurant Brands has started the process to dispose of its 15% ownership stake in the joint venture. It wants to do so immediately, Shear said, but it will take ""some time"" based on the terms of the agreement. There are ""no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement,"" Shear wrote. ""Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today?"" he wrote. ""No."" Kolobov said he has never had control of operations since the joint venture formed in 2012. He controls 30% of the partnership and said the decision to suspend operations ""must be taken by all shareholders considering the impact it may have"" on approximately 25,000 employees.

628,0,TechScape: How the internet became a key front in Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine,1011 words,The Guardian,"Given what we know and expect from Russia, itâs unlikely to come as a shock that ï¿½?according to data from Checkpoint Research ï¿½?in the first three days of combat, cyber-attacks on Ukraineâs government and military sector went up by 196%, compared to the rest of February. But what has been interesting to watch has been the fightback, with attacks on Russia up 4% for the week. It might not sound like much, but there has been noticeable pushback from white hat hackers, hactivist groups and others on the counterattack. Meanwhile, Ukraine has launched its own volunteer IT army[https://www-wired-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/story/ukraine-it-army-russia-war-cyberattacks-ddos/], looking to respond to Russian cyber-attacks. Ukraineâs deputy PM Mykhailo Fedorov made the announcement on Telegram, stating: We have a lot of talented Ukrainians in the digital sphere: developers, cyber specialists, designers, copywriters, marketers ï¿½?We continue to fight on the cyber front. A separate Telegram channel, reported to contain 175,000 people, is used to assign tasks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on key Russian websites including government sites, banks, and energy businesses. Russian state media site Tass has also been targeted[https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3vxkg/russian-state-media-tass-hacked-casualty-numbers] by hackers to show the number of Russian casualties. The conflict has even drawn division among ransomware groups. The Conti group had its internal communications leaked[https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/28/conti-ransomware-chats-leaked/] this week by a pro-Ukraine member who was angry that the group had sided with Russia. Rife misinformation As with any major news event, misinformation and disinformation are everywhere on social media. Beyond the expected viral videos or photos that turn out to be old or completely unrelated, thereâs already evidence that disinformation is circulating from pro-Russian forces. Both Twitter and Facebook reported this week[https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/facebook-twitter-remove-disinformation-accounts-targeting-ukrainians-rcna17880] that they removed two pro-Russian covert influence operations from Russia and Belarus. Metaâs head of security Nathaniel Gleicher and director of threat disruption David Agranovich said the operations were run from Russia and Ukraine, and were targeting people in Ukraine on multiple platforms and websites. âWe took down this operation, blocked their domains from being shared on our platform, and shared information with other tech platforms, researchers and governments,ï¿½?they said in a blog post. The network in question was relatively minor, with about 4,000 accounts following one page on Facebook, and fewer than 500 following its Instagram accounts. The sites were pushing many of the lines Putin was using to justify the invasion.

How social media responds Within Russia itself, access to Twitter and Facebook has reportedly been restricted[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60533083], in part on the basis that Facebook had refused demands to stop factchecking Russian media outlets.

The company also tweaked its algorithm so that the links wonât appear in top search results.  Google and Facebook announced they would suspend the media companies from being able to monetise on their platforms, while Twitter is pausing ads[https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1497353976588689411] in Russia and Ukraine. Crypto donations It would be impossible to talk about theway the war is being waged online without discussing the growing role of cryptocurrency. The Ukrainian governmentâs call for donations in crypto has been loudly heard, with over US$18m flooding into the country in the first few days of the conflict to fund Ukraine armed forces. The country has been accepting donations in Ethereum, bitcoin and Tether. The worldâs largest crypto exchange Binance, committed $10m[https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/6bce8615076a4173a4738817c597b09e] in donations towards Ukraine. In a bid to ensure the western alliesï¿½?sanctions against Russia have even more of an impact, Fedorov also called for all major crypto exchanges to block addresses of Russian users. âItâs crucial to freeze not only the addresses linked to Russian and Belarusian politicians, but also to sabotage ordinary users,ï¿½?he said in a tweet. This call, however, has been met with more reluctance. Binance told CNBC[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/28/binance-will-not-block-russian-accounts-after-ukraine-request.html] it would suspend individuals on the sanction list, but would not go as far as banning all Russian addresses. âTo unilaterally decide to ban peopleâs access to their crypto would fly in the face of the reason why crypto exists,ï¿½?the spokesperson said. KuCoin told the outlet it would not do so without a legal requirement, stating it would âimpact the rights of innocent people.ï¿½?Enter Elon Musk  It wouldnât be a major online and news event without Elon Musk, for better or worse, and of course it all played out on Twitter.

655,0,Cyber breach hits Sky News,380 words,The Sydney Morning Herald,"A letter, seen by this masthead, apologised for the breach, but it is unclear how many staff were affected. ""While we have received no reports from Frontier that any of this information has been published online or any other unwanted or harmful behaviour, we think it is important to let you know about this so that you can take steps to protect this information and we would like to apologise to you that this may have happened,"" the letter said. Sky News was approached for comment but did not respond before deadline. The letters were sent weeks after Frontier Software told Nine Entertainment Co, owner of this masthead, that about 500 current and former employees had their personal payroll details stolen. Frontier initially told Nine Radio, which runs 2GB, 3AW and 4BC, that no personal information of its employees had been released, but changed its view after further analysis. The data accessed included full names, home and email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, tax file numbers, salaries, payroll IDs and superannuation fund details. Sky News said the details could include full names and bank account numbers. Sky News no longer uses Frontier as its payroll provider. Research from McGrath Nicol late last year showed ransomware attacks are becoming a big problem for Australian executives, with 35 per cent of companies having suffered a ransomware attack and 83 per cent of those businesses paying a ransom. The use of ransomware on Australian business led to the creation of a new taskforce by the Australian Federal Police, which allows it to more effectively fight crime groups within Australia and overseas. The federal government last year announced a ransomware action plan with more funding for security officials to go after criminal gangs. It also introduced legislation that requires companies hit by ransomware to report to the Australian Cyber Security Centre."
101,0,The Star may struggle to keep casino licence after shocking evidence,679 words,The Sydney Morning Herald - Online,"In February 2021, Crown was found unfit by the Bergin inquiry to hold its casino licence after Patricia Bergin confirmed allegations, first revealed by The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and 60 Minutes, that Crown had facilitated organised crime and money laundering due to appalling corporate governance. The public hearings into Star are looking at similar misconduct, unearthed in October by The Age and the Herald. It's no accident that Adam Bell, SC, is at the helm of The Star public probe. He was the quietly fearless and forensically ferocious counsel assisting Judge Bergin. It was Mr Bell who brought Crown's former executives and its main shareholder, James Packer, to their knees. The Crown allegations Mr Bell dissected are near identical to those facing Star and, at their heart, suggest a business culture that prioritised revenue over everything else, including the risk of enriching organised crime linked high-roller tour companies and VIP gamblers. On Monday, a Star financial manager, Paulinka Dudek, confirmed the practice first reported in The Age and the Herald in October that Star had for years run a system that disguised as ""hotel expenses"" what were in fact gambling funds. These gambling funds were smuggled out of China by high rollers. In pretending this money was for accommodation and other hotel expenses, Star ignored basic anti-money laundering procedures as it sought to help gamblers avoid China's strict capital flight and anti-gambling laws. The use of the same dishonest system by Crown prompted the royal commission in Victoria to describe the Melbourne casino as rotten. But where Crown disguised more than $160 million in this manner, the Bell inquiry on Thursday revealed that Star in Sydney pretended that at least $900 million were hotel expenses rather than gambling cash. Watching Dudek give evidence was excruciating, and not only because she was forced to admit her part in an unethical practice. Dudek, who appeared on the verge of tears at times, is small fry in the scheme of things. Dudek only became familiar with the long-running ""hotel expenses"" scheme in 2019, and her evidence strongly suggested she was simply following the orders of senior executives when she misled Star's banking partner about it. These executives will no doubt be grilled by Bell and his counsel assisting, Naomi Sharp, SC, and the claim that almost a billion dollars was disguised as hotel expenses suggests some executives may soon be looking for new jobs. Even more concerning is that a leaked KPMG audit, which was published as part of the October media expose of Star, made it clear that Star executives and board members were warned in 2018 that the casino's anti-money laundering controls were failing. When Star's dirty conduct was comprehensively detailed on the front page of this paper, it should have been apparent to Star's board, led by prominent sports and business figure John O'Neill, that the firm was in as much trouble as Crown. But, much like Crown's initial reaction to revelations of its wrongdoing, Star played down the media reports and hoped that other media outlets wouldn't bother doing their own digging. If the foolishness of this strategy wasn't made clear by Crown's experience, day one of the Bell inquiry has made it abundantly so.

811,1,Delta Air's profitable March and upbeat guidance boost airline stocks,720 words,MarketWatch,"Delta also spoke of a recovery in business and international air travel, which had been twin concerns for investors going into earnings day.

""Demand for long-haul international is growing as travel restrictions lift led by the trans-Atlantic. To-date, we have not seen an impact to travel demand from the conflict in Ukraine, but we of course are monitoring this closely,"" Bastian said. Delta stock rallied 6% on Wednesday, with shares of United Holdings Inc. UAL matching that advance and shares of American Airlines Group Inc. AAL gaining more than 10%.  American Airlines stock, the best performer on the S&P 500 index SPX on Wednesday, was on track for its highest close since Jan. 13, and on pace for its largest one-day percentage increase since Nov. 9, 2020, when it rose 15%. Analysts at Bernstein, led by David Vernon, called Delta's second-quarter revenue guidance ""very strong,"" as the company expects sales to be between 93% and 97% restored to second-quarter 2019 levels.

Eventually, the focus for markets and travelers will be on how high air fares can go before demand starts to be impacted, they said. ""It is clear in the current market that consumers and business travelers are prioritizing air travel and absorbing higher fares, but it would be foolish to believe that this will continue at any price point,"" the Bernstein analysts said. ""In our view it is less important to consider where the upper band on fares may be, but instead focus on whether there is enough rate and operating leverage in the model to restore profitability and begin meaningful balance sheet repair,"" they said. ""The early indications in reporting seasons are constructive in this regard."" Delta is trying to keep up with ""robust demand,"" and higher fares are not ""disrupting this pace so far,"" Citi analyst Stephen Trent said in his note. Delta executives said on the call they were aware of ""broad concerns"" about economic conditions in the U.S. in the second half of the year, but that demand remains strong and the airline is focusing on avoiding running out of seats, Trent said. ""Overall, the tone of the carrier's results call was very encouraging,"" he said. Trent kept his rating on Delta shares at buy. MKM Partners analysts also took an optimistic view of Delta and the higher fares. The airline ""is having no issues pushing price as demand has surged back with leisure, corporate, and (international) all improving,"" they said. The company also talked about double-digit operating margins and free cash flow generation, ""which is an encouraging sign that management views the demand recovery as a sustainable one and not just driven by the spring/summer season,"" the MKM Partners analysts said.  American Airlines and United Airlines are slated to report first-quarter results next week. Shares of the top 3 U.S. air carriers are in the red for the last 12 months, but their losses currently are slightly lower than the broader losses for the industry.  American Airlines stock is off 17% in the last 12 months, while Delta and United shares are down 15% and 21%.

He also noted the challenges of the labor shortage and supply-chain issues that led to higher costs. Mr. Jassy said the company's employee injury rates were ""sometimes misunderstood"" but vowed to do better. He said incidents in its warehouses were slightly above Amazon's peers' average, and slightly lower than the company's peers' average in the courier and delivery businessâputting the company overall on par with others.  Amazon workers last year suffered serious injury rates at twice the rate of non-Amazon warehouses, according to a study published this month by the Strategic Organizing Center, a coalition of four labor unions. Employees at several Amazon warehouses have sought to unionize[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/amazon-union-re-vote-in-alabama-too-close-to-call-11648761115], and some workers have criticized the company over concerns about safety and how the company tracks productivity, including the rate at which employees must sort packages. Workers at a facility in Staten Island, N.Y., earlier this month voted to form the company's first union[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/amazon-workers-in-new-york-vote-to-form-tech-giants-first-u-s-union-11648831151] in a landmark victory against the company.  Amazon last week appealed the loss[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/amazon-intends-to-appeal-union-victory-in-new-york-11649366945] due to actions it accused the National Labor Relations Board and union group of taking before and during the vote. Mr. Jassy, who didn't address the union defeat in his letter, said in an interview with CNBC Thursday morning that unions slow down efforts by employees to improve their workplaces. ""It's [the] employees' choice whether or not they want to join a union,"" Mr. Jassy said on CNBC. ""We happen to think they're better off not doing so."" Mr. Jassy in his letter said he spent significant time in Amazon's facilities when he first took over as CEO and hoped to find simple answers to quickly improve injuries. ""I didn't find that,"" he said. Much of Mr. Jassy's letter is focused on innovation, both of new products or services at Amazon and how the company seeks to improve as it expands into new industries. Mr. Jassy ran through several of Amazon's most notable achievements, including the creation of its cloud computing unit Amazon Web Services, its vast package delivery operation and flagship devices such as the Kindle e-reader and Alexa voice assistant. Mr. Jassy also spoke of the company's massive growth throughout the pandemic, saying it grew the equivalent of three years' forecasted growth in 15 months. Amazon hired voraciously through the period and spent heavily building out its warehousing capacity, with about a million U.S. employees now and over 1,000 estimated facilities, according to logistics consultant MWPVL International. That growth has slowed down lately. The company earlier this year posted fourth-quarter earnings that showed a $206 million operating loss[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/amazon-amzn-q4-earnings-report-2021-11643848062], and sales in its online stores segment fell by 1%, the first year-over-year decline since the metric was first disclosed in 2016. Amazon warned at the time of slowing growth for its first quarter. Mr. Jassy took over Amazon from Mr. Bezos, the founder who is now executive chairman of the company. Mr. Bezos wrote annual shareholder letters[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/amazon-ceo-bezos-says-he-doesnt-take-comfort-in-alabama-union-vote-11618495830] since the company went public in 1997. The letters often highlighted the company's successes, usually told with a storytelling flourish. In his last letter as CEO a year ago, Mr. Bezos similarly wrote about fixing Amazon's injury rates as part of a new vow to become ""Earth's Best Employer."" In the CNBC interview on Thursday, Mr. Jassy said he speaks to Mr. Bezos weekly. ""It's great to have a sounding board,"" he said. ""He has so much wisdom."" While Amazon hired more than 300,000 workers last year, Mr. Jassy said on CNBC that the company still didn't have enough people in certain locations. Mr. Jassy in his letter also addressed Amazon's carbon footprint and said the company is making significant progress on its climate pledge to be net-zero carbon by 2040, though he said it would take ""relentless invention"" to achieve its goals. He said Amazon is committed to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of the company's initial target. In ending his letter, Mr. Jassy turned to the often-repeated phrase by his predecessor that has become as much company lore as a pledge for the e-commerce powerhouse to not turn to mediocracy.

932,1,"Wildwoods tourism officials expect another busy summer, launch almost $1M ad campaign",820 words,Philadelphia Business Journal,"Highlights of the campaign include a new video featuring Wildwoods attractions including the boardwalk, beaches and amusement piers. There will be 30-second and 15-second spots airing on network and cable TV, video-on-demand, and streaming services throughout the Northeast corridor and Canada, a primary international feeder market. The tourism authority has renewed for up to 10 years the exclusive licensing for the song âWildwood Daysï¿½?by Bobby Rydell, which the locale previously used in its advertising for more than a decade, Siciliano said. Social media marketing efforts will take place on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, while online digital advertising will target women between the ages of 25 and 54, families with children, millennials, and multi-generational family vacationers. Women in that age range are the âbread and butterï¿½?for Wildwoods marketing because theyâre the ones who make the decisions regarding family vacations, said Ben Rose, director of marketing and public relations. The goal is to appeal to those travelers at a young age so they start their family traditions in the Wildwoods, ultimately going on to pass them down through the generations. The main messaging for this summer season is that the Wildwoods have something to offer for every member of a multi-generational family, Siciliano added. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the Greater Wildwoods Tourism Improvement and Development Authority last year reported that tourism revenue in the key categories of lodging and prepared food and beverage was 36% above that of the previous five-year average tourism revenues, excluding 2020 data. That fueled a record $6.5 million in tourism tax revenue in the Wildwoods in 2021. Prior to the pandemic, the organization saw consistent year-over-year tourism revenue growth between 2016 and 2019, per the development authority. It grew by 8% in 2017, by 3% in 2018, and by 10% in 2019. The Wildwoods are anticipating another strong summer this year. While concerns around inflation and rising gas prices are on the radar of tourism officials, they ultimately donât anticipate those issues throwing off summer turnout. âWeâve learned that the price of gas isnât going to stop a family from going away for a weekend or five-day vacation and that it does help keep them more local,ï¿½?Siciliano said. That comes as the tourism authority looks to target potential travelers within a one-tank drive market. The organization expanded its marketing footprint during the pandemic because many travelers were abstaining from flying ï¿½?and in many cases still are. If a circle was drawn on a map to indicate the Wildwoodsï¿½?target market, it would encompass New England, New York, eastern Ohio, northern Virginia, Maryland and Delaware, Rose said. Eastern Ohio, northern Virginia and Pittsburgh are among the particularly strong markets right now, he added. Canada is also back on the table this year after stunted turnout during the pandemic. As reservations from Canadians are beginning to come into the Wildwoods' hotels, the tourism authority has expanded its reach to Ontario, noting itâs about the same distance away as Quebec. The Wildwoods Convention Center, which is also operated by the tourism authority, is back to a full schedule of events, Rose noted. Pre-pandemic, the space typically did 42 weekends of business, with a 95% return rate on events. The Wildwoods' summer season will kick into high gear June 16-19 with the Barefoot Country Music Fest, which is anticipated to draw 50,000 attendees to the beach each day, Siciliano said. A $4 million renovation of the boardwalk is also anticipated to be completed by mid-May, just in time for the high season. Still, Wildwoods tourism officials anticipate ongoing labor issues this summer even as employment increases compared to the last couple of years [https://www-bizjournals-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/philadelphia/news/2021/05/06/j-1-visas-wildwood-jersey-shore-businesses.html]. Siciliano said he anticipates the Wildwoodsï¿½?crucial J-1 visa exchange program that brings in international student workers will have higher turnout [https://www-bizjournals-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/philadelphia/news/2022/04/05/russia-ukraine-war-j-1-summer-work-program.html] in 2022, though still a far cry from 2019 numbers. Similar issues are present in the local talent pool. For example, the convention center, which does not use J-1 employees, is short-handed by about 12 staffers and is relying on temp workers, Siciliano said. âWe are keeping our fingers crossed,ï¿½?he added.

309,0,EPHRAIM HARDCASTLE; COLUMN; BY,525 words,Daily Mail,"TEAM GB's women curlers are on their way home with Olympic gold and have received congratulations from the Queen. Curling has enjoyed royal support for longer than most sports thanks to Queen Victoria. In 1842, she and Prince Albert were fascinated by a curling demonstration at Scone Palace. It took place in the ballroom where the floor had been specially polished to compensate for the lack of ice. A year later, she granted a charter to the Royal Caledonian Curling Club, of which the current monarch is patron. Star curler Eve Muirhead, pictured, made an MBE in 2020, can look forward to an upgrade after leading her team to glory. She could entertain the Queen with her bagpipes, which she has played since childhood, busking outside her local fish and chip shop. THERESA May has been speech-making in Australia, promoting 'opportunities for women in politics and business'. Lady May co-founded the Women2Win campaign in 2005 when there were just 17 Tory female MPs. By 2020 that number had increased to 87. Liberals in Victoria brought Mrs May to Melbourne, paying her Â£61,000 for two Â£500-a-ticket political events. DISCUSSING Her Majesty's schedule on ITV, serial name-dropper and ex-Tory MP Gyles Brandreth recalls: 'When I was Lord Commissioner of the Treasury... I had to sign cheques with the Queen - any multi-million pound Government expenditure. I said: ""You know, Your Majesty, the way the Government insists on the two of us signing these huge cheques, I can't help wondering which of the two of us the Government doesn't trust? She had no answer to that.' We were not amused, perhaps? 'DAISY Waugh is 55 today,' we were told by The Times last Saturday. Why did little-known novelist Miss Waugh rate a mention (and a photo) in a column usually reserved for famous and/or distinguished citizens? She is the daughter of the late writer Auberon Waugh, who was the son of novelist Evelyn Waugh. 'Bron' used to boast that he knew The Times employee who chose the birthdays.

781,0,Hackers Targeted News Corp's Tech Suppliers; Investigators believe hackers accessed emails and documents to aid Chinese intelligence,837 words,The Wall Street Journal Online,"The company in a securities filing on Friday said it ""relies on third-party providers for certain technology and 'cloud-based' systems and services that support a variety of business operations,"" and that one of these systems ""was the target of persistent cyberattack activity."" The attack came as U.S. officials over the past year have been increasingly warning of criminal and nation-state hackers breaking into the computer systems of organizations through sometimes opaque supply chains for software and other technologies. A News Corp spokesman on Friday declined to comment on its vendors or which data was stolen, citing a continuing investigation. In its email to staff, News Corp said that computer systems housing consumer and financial data weren't affected. ""In addition, we have not experienced related interruptions to our business operations,"" Chief Technology Officer David Kline and Chief Information Security Officer Billy O'Brien wrote in the email. ""Based on our investigation to date, we believe the threat activity is contained."" Messrs. Kline and O'Brien said their inquiry is in its early stages. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that hackers had access to News Corp's systems since at least February 2020, gaining access to emails and Google Docs, including drafts of articles. Beijing that year expelled U.S. journalists[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/china-bans-all-u-s-nationals-working-for-the-wall-street-journal-new-york-times-washington-post-whose-press-credentials-end-in-2020-11584464690] employed by news outlets including the Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post. Gaining access to emails and documents could give hackers snapshots of reporters' sources and plans for articles, said Runa Sandvik, a former senior director for information security at the New York Times. ""Let's say attackers get access to emails. Then, potentially, there could be communications about who is going to cover the Olympics in China,"" said Ms. Sandvik, who now consults for media organizations. ""How are they collaborating?""  News Corp said Friday it disclosed the hack to law-enforcement officials and is providing technical details of the attack to the Media and Entertainment Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a nonprofit that shares security information among the media industry. Chris Taylor, director of the ME-ISAC, declined to comment on any data News Corp shared, as companies report such information under the promise of anonymity. In most incidents analyzed by the nonprofit, hackers blast out phishing emails to countless potential targets in the hope of landing a victim, Mr. Taylor said. Attacks tailored for specific organizations ""are scarier but they are way less frequent,"" he said. ""Attackers will do more research.""  Mandiant Inc., a cybersecurity company that specializes in investigating hacks, is helping News Corp respond to the incident. ""Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests,"" said David Wong, Mandiant's vice president of consulting. ""China firmly opposes and combats cyber attacks and cyber theft in all forms,"" a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said in an email. ""We hope that there can be a professional, responsible and evidence-based approach to identifying cyber-related incidents, rather than making allegations based on speculations."" The report of the breach comes days after Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray warned of Chinese-linked attempts to steal sensitive or valuable data. Speaking Tuesday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Mr. Wray highlighted last year's hack of thousands[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/china-linked-hack-hits-tens-of-thousands-of-u-s-microsoft-customers-11615007991] of U.S. companies through certain versions of Microsoft Corp.'s Exchange email client, which is used by many businesses. ""The Chinese government steals staggering volumes of information and causes deep, job-destroying damage across a range of industriesâso much so that, as you heard, we're constantly opening new cases to counter their intelligence operations, about every 12 hours or so,"" he said. The Biden administration has ordered federal agencies to more aggressively vet their vendors and has urged companies to do the same as they shore up their internal defenses. Suppliers are appealing targets because they often have poorly understood connections to other businesses, cybersecurity experts say, raising the possibility that a single hack can wreak widespread havoc. In December 2020, several federal agencies discovered that a suspected Russian espionage operation broke into their computer systems through a compromised software update from network-management firm SolarWinds Corp. Criminal hackers breached software provider Kaseya Ltd. last summer, exposing hundreds of its clients[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/kaseya-gets-tool-to-unlock-data-after-ransomware-attack-11626990619] to potential ransomware attacks.

2,1,Why Aptus Value Housing Finance is a promising buy,1092 words,BusinessLine Online,"Why affordable housing Post the mega HDFC Limited - HDFC Bank merger, there may be a shortage of quality candidates in the housing finance space. Large players such as LIC Housing and PNB Housing have their respective overhangs, and this shifts focus on mid-sized players such as Repco Home Finance and CanFin Homes. But these are not a pureplay on affordable housing and hence stocks such as Aavas Financiers, Home First Finance and Aptus come to limelight.  Click to view image[https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/j5zn86/article65327019.ece/alternates/FREE_660/PO17_Aptus_vs_Peers.jpg]  Among the three, Aptus has a history of superior return and margin profile. This is despite having a loan book smaller than peers. Even in asset quality terms, Aptus takes a lead. The stock trades at a premium to Home First, its nearest comparable, because of its superior return ratios and its dominance in the southern states. While it is at discount to Aavas, the valuation gap between the two has narrowed recently. Business Incorporated in 2009, Aptus was founded by M Anandan, a former veteran in Murugappa group. WestBridge invested two years later and is the major private equity partner. Its loan book size is about ï¿½?,500 crore and all of it concentrated in south India. Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh account for 49 per cent and 30 per cent of its loan book respectively. Aptusï¿½?objective is to cater to the unserved and these included small-time self-employed borrowers such as carpenters, kirana shop owners, small-time vendors. The focus is largely in the rural and semi-urban areas where banks donât have much penetration. The company has built an in-house team for credit appraisal, risk underwriting and collection teams and this enables them have a proprietary database. Targeting the first-time home buyers, nearly 53 per cent of the loan book is generated by mortgages. Average ticket size is about ï¿½? lakh. While the company can go up to 85 per cent loan to value, the average LTV is 38 per cent , largely for mortgages . Catering to the affordable housing space, the property value of borrowers is ï¿½?0 ï¿½?40 lakh. Lending to the unbanked gives Aptus a runway in fixing its interest rates. At an average yield of 17 per cent, maintained at all stages of disruption ï¿½?whether 2016âs demonisation or the pandemic, superior yields have been Aptusï¿½?USP. Profitability or net interest margin at 8.89 per cent is also the best in class. That said, cost of funds at eight per cent compares higher to peers at about seven per cent. Aptus sources 51 per cent of its funds from bank and given its customer profile, risk premium ascribed by banks may be slightly higher compared to large NBFCs. 77 per cent of its loans are fixed rate book, while the remaining loan are offered at variable interest rates. A reversal in the interest rate regime may not have a far-reaching implication in its NIM, though a marginal and temporary NIM correction cannot be ruled out. Asset quality Was Aptus preparing itself for listing since FY21? The question is unmissable if one gives a cursory glance of its non-performing assets (NPA). Gross NPA stood at 0.7 per cent and 0.6 per cent in FY20 and FY21 respectively. Even as lenders started restructuring the troublesome accounts from September 2020, Aptus had no restructured accounts till March 2021. Nine months later, the share of restructured accounts to its total loan book stood at 1.5 per cent. Its gross and net NPAs rose to 1.53 per cent and 1.16 per cent respectively in Q3 FY22, largely led by its small business loans portfolio, where gross NPA in Q3 FY22 was 1.25 per cent, as against 0.58 per cent in home loans and 0.21 per cent in LAP portfolios.  Click to view image[https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/x744ej/article65327020.ece/alternates/FREE_660/PO17_TS_Aptus_loan_mix.jpg]  But, its worth giving the company benefit of doubt, considering that the impact of the second wave of Covid was pronounced only in June quarter of FY22. Hence if the company decided to address the asset quality issues towards May - June 2021, its not a deviation from common practices. Also Aptusï¿½?restructured book is at comfortable level compared to NBFCs tolerance band of two-three per cent restructured loans. Even its NPA numbers are better than peers. However, with Q3âs provision coverage ratio at 25 per cent, investors should brace for two-three quarters of extended asset quality pain. The normalisation to one per cent gross NPA may be some years away. Much of it also depends on how fast the company is willing to grow its book. Post pandemic, loan growth rate moderated to 28 per cent CAGR, while it was around 44 per cent from FY16 ï¿½?FY20. Key risks While geographic concentration is giving the upper hand for Aptus in terms of return ratios and valuations, it does pose risk in the long-term. Bandhanâs dependence on eastern India or the then SKS Microfinanceâs Andhra Pradesh heavy loan books are a few to name on how concentration risk cannot be overlooked. Why Levered to affordable housing theme Good execution track record Stock underperformance offers opportunity Likewise, the free float in Aptus stock is quite thin at 16.13 per cent, as shares of the promoter group and other institutional investors remain locked-in due to the regulatory requirements. The stock could be highly prone to market fluctuations."
100,0,What Happened to Hong Kong?,2015 words,The Atlantic,"This situation feels all the more shocking because in early 2020, Hong Kong was ahead of the COVID curve, not lagging behind it. As soon as news emerged of a still-mysterious virus, everyone here began wearing masks and adapted to social distancing almost immediately; I wrote article after article about what life would look like in the weeks to come in America, having seen the future myself. While the West was caught off guard, Hong Kong felt prepared. Now medical facilities are overwhelmed with sick patients, and because morgues have struggled to keep pace, body bags are piled up in hospitals alongside patients still receiving treatment. Coffins are being shipped in to meet the demand. Construction workers are racing to build isolation facilities, including one that looks like a wartime field hospital on the border with the mainland. Some 300,000 people are in isolation or under home quarantine. After recording only 213 deaths and about 13,000 cases of COVID-19 from January 2020 to early 2022, the city is swamped by the current Omicron wave, which began at the start of the year and has led to more than 960,000 cases and more than 4,600 deaths. Hong Kong was lauded for controlling the coronavirusâs spread with its âzero-COVID strategy[https://www-theatlantic-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/international/archive/2022/02/china-covid-zero-policy-restrictions/621476/?utm_source=feed].ï¿½?It has ample vaccine doses. It is wealthy enough to support its poorest people if it chooses to. It has effectively shut down swaths of its economy, including its lucrative tourism sector, to battle the virus. And yet this month, it recorded one of the highest COVID death rates in the world. What just happened? Hong Kong has employed its zero-COVID strategy since the onset of the pandemic. The approach has not been as restrictive as the one used in mainland China, which calls for shutting down[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-13/china-places-all-shenzhen-residents-under-lockdown-afp] whole metropolises and testing their population over a handful of COVID cases. The city has an aggressive test-and-trace program, as well as toughened border controls, to catch infections and break transmission lines, and enacts social-distancing measures when cases spike. All of this helped Hong Kong buy itself time in the early stages of the pandemic, when vaccines were not available, keeping deaths to a minimum. But now it clings to measures not based on sound science, and which experts have dismissed as largely performative (while also being heavily damaging to its travel- and service-based economy). It has neither pivoted to a more flexible approach nor prepared for an outbreak that analysts repeatedly warned was inevitable. The missteps are almost too numerous to recount, but the worst ones have to do with Hong Kongâs singular inability to vaccinate its population. The governmentâs efforts were from the start imbued with politics and marred by poor messaging. It initially rushed through approval of the China-made Sinovac vaccine, and city leaders made a show of being inoculated with it, despite a better optionâBioNTechâs mRNA jabâbeing available. (The large majority of deaths have been among the unvaccinated, but officials refuse to disclose data on which vaccine was administered to those who died after being vaccinated.) Press releases highlighting, with little context, the vaccineâs adverse effects were amplified by the media, leading to intense skepticism. Distrust in the government, still lingering from its handling of prodemocracy protests in 2019, did not help the cause[https://www-theatlantic-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/international/archive/2021/04/hong-kong-trust-vaccine/618469/?utm_source=feed]. And most troubling has been the poor vaccination rate among the cityâs elderly population, a persistent problem. Today, just 55 percent of people older than 80 have received one vaccine shot[https://www.covidvaccine.gov.hk/en/dashboard/], and 36 percent have received two. Lam Ching-choi, a physician and a member of Chief Executive Carrie Lamâs cabinet, told me that the governmentâs early reliance on family doctors to advise patients on vaccination was a mistake: Many warned the elderly to be cautious about receiving the vaccine. Predictably, COVID has swept through residential care homesâmore than 29,000 elderly care-home residents have been infected during the current wave. Lam also told me that the government should have offered at-home vaccination for residents with mobility issues, and said the authorities would soon begin implementing that program. Yet it will start only next week, more than two months into the surge and more than a year after the vaccine rollout initially began. The 21-day hotel quarantine required for all arrivals into Hong Kong, even for those without COVID, is dangerous and unscientific[https://www.otandp.com/blog/is-hong-kongs-21-day-quarantine-evidence-based-or-justified], experts told me, but the government has continued the practice anyway, leading to cross infections and a spike in cases. A government-funded study[https://www-mdpi-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/2076-393X/9/7/696] published last year warned about vaccine hesitancy, but officials did little beyond sloganeering and a perfunctory poster drive. The government also insisted on issuing compulsory testing notices to residents even when testing and quarantine facilities were already overloaded, leading to more stress on a teetering health system. Flight bans from countries including the United States and Britain are scheduled to be in place until next month, though the governmentâs own advisers say there is no reason for this to continue. In sum, decision makers ignored public-health expertise, driven instead by politics and overly enthusiastic efforts to show fealty to Beijing. The result has been an embarrassingly shambolic effort that has created a preventable public-health disaster, yet another glaring failure of governance from an administration whose defining characteristic is catastrophic ineptitude. âThe question to ask, not unreasonably, would be: How come we either didnât have a good plan or didnât execute a good plan?ï¿½?Gabriel Leung, the dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong and a pandemic-response adviser to the government, told me. When I asked whether he had any thoughts on the answer to that question, Leung responded, âSuffice to say that we have done our very best to generate the best science to inform policy decisions. And, as Margaret Thatcher once said, âAdvisers advise; ministers decide.ï¿½?Letâs put it at that.ï¿½? Tyrone Siu / Reuters[https://cdn-theatlantic-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/media/img/posts/2022/03/2022_03_01T041301Z_717440641_RC2FTS9J1AV9_RTRMADP_3_HEALTH_CORONAVIRUS_HONGKONG/2aca39a6a.jpg]  Much of the world has struggled with various phases of the pandemic, but Hong Kongâs difficulties are in no small part due to the fact that the city no longer has even its previous limited democratic accountability to push the government to review public-health decisions, thanks to a crackdown by Beijing and the imposition of a draconian national-security law. For varying reasons, many residents believed the governmentâs fiction that only a small minority[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp8nPxZgn-4] of people would be affected by these changes, but the mishandling of COVID has highlighted how the reengineering of Hong Kong will touch all aspects of life. With opposition voices silenced[https://www-theatlantic-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/international/archive/2021/03/hong-kong-prodemocracy-protesters-trial/618356/?utm_source=feed], Hong Kongâs rulers claimed they could more efficiently govern. But in the city legislature, overhauled last year to ensure that nationalism and obedience are valued over competence and political know-how, suggestions on how to tame the outbreak have included the wildly impractical (using cruise ships as temporary isolation facilities) and the patently absurd (dropping fresh food into Hong Kong by drone). Even this newfound sense of urgency on the part of lawmakers and the government has emerged only after Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke last month of the âoverriding missionï¿½?to bring the current outbreak under control. At the same time, pro-Beijing pundits and mainland officials have cast pandemic response, and adherence to âdynamic zero COVID,ï¿½?as a loyalty test. (Determining what exactly âdynamic zero COVIDï¿½?means is futile; the description shifts from official to official and day to day. Nevertheless, authorities insist that it shouldnât be questioned.) The director of Chinaâs Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said this month that âpatriotic forces must forcefully expose, criticize, and sanction with laws the anti-China destabilizing forces who launched smearing attacks, spread rumors, and created panic to disrupt the anti-pandemic efforts.ï¿½?Addressing the United Nations, a Hong Kong doctor said that the idea of living with the virus was tantamount to the U.S. creating âbiological terrorists,ï¿½?in a melodramatic [https://www.tkww.hk/a/202203/09/AP6227ef10e4b0cd9e1ce40580.html]  screed[https://www.tkww.hk/a/202203/09/AP6227ef10e4b0cd9e1ce40580.html] that seemed scripted for a comic-book villain. Hong Kongâs civil service has become a targeted group, fingered as being polluted by Western ideas for questioning the COVID strategy. âHong Kongâs pandemic response definitely shows the NSL [national-security law] new order is not only about election and activists, but extends to all realms of life,ï¿½?Ho-Fung Hung, a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and the author of the forthcoming book City on the Edge: Hong Kong Under Chinese Rule[https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781108840330], told me by email. As they did with the imposition of the national-security law, mainland officials felt the need to step in to address COVID-related problems that the Hong Kong government had created for itself, a move that has been met with slavish praise. Newspapers controlled by the Chinese government here have splashed their pages with adoration for workers arriving from over the border. Pro-Beijing lawmakers have rushed to social media to post their gratitude to the âmotherlandï¿½?for its support. My inbox fills up daily with statements thanking Beijing for taking control. The cityâs secretary of health applauded the mainlandâs donation of traditional Chinese medicine. (Authorities in Singapore[https://www.hsa.gov.sg/announcements/news/advisorycovid-lianhuaqingwen], by contrast, have warned that there is âno scientific evidenceï¿½?that one such remedy, called lianhua qingwen, can be used âto prevent or treat COVID-19,ï¿½?while Australia has banned the sale of the treatment entirely[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-02-17/banned-chinese-medicine-lianhua-qingwen-in-australia-covid/100837934].) The endless, unrestrained flattery seems akin to the celebration of an arsonist who lights his house on fire, cuts the water hose, and then cheers as the fire brigade arrives to extinguish the flames. All the while, the broader political purge and repression of rights that was already under way in Hong Kong has carried on undisrupted. Half a dozen people were arrested and charged with sedition last month. In early March, the former head of the bar association, a British lawyer, was questioned by national-security police before he left the city, followed through the airport by reporters from Chinese state media.

This conviction underscores the importance of ensuring that the criminal justice system responds effectively at all levels. 'However, far-reaching procedural and institutional reform, and not the death penalty, is needed to tackle the endemic problem of violence against women in Pakistan - like everywhere else. If authorities want to take meaningful steps to ensure justice for women and girls, they must avoid using the death penalty as a 'quick fix' and commit to ensuring the criminal justice system prevents and responds to such crimes effectively at every stage,' she said in the statement. Noor Mukkadam, 27, was murdered and beheaded at the residence of Zahir Jaffar on July 20, 2021. Zahir, his parents and their staff members were arrested shortly after. After a seven-month trial, a local court found Zahir guilty and sentenced him to death. The staff members, who were present at the scene of the crime, were given 10-year jail sentences. His parents, alleged to have aided Zahir with getting rid of the body, were acquitted. The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. Amnesty opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception - regardless of who is accused, the nature or circumstances of the crime, guilt or innocence or method of execution, said the human rights organisation in the statement."
719,0,Fake K-pop merchandise faces tougher crackdown,423 words,The Korea Herald,"Major entertainment firms such as Hybe, S.M. Entertainment, JYP Entertainment and YG Entertainment have submitted a list of their trademark rights to assist the Korea Intellectual Property Protection Agency in monitoring of violations. If online counterfeit items are discovered, the entertainment firms will inspect the merchandise to verify their authenticity. Illegal sellersï¿½?online promotional posts will be taken down. âRecognizing the need to manage intellectual property rights and tackle such illegal activities, weâll actively support the local entertainment industry,ï¿½?Choi Kwang-ho, secretary general of KMCA, said in a statement. The latest crackdown is part of the KMCA and KIPOâs ongoing effort to tackle counterfeit K-pop merchandise sellers. They conducted the first crackdown in late 2020 and took action on 8,000 cases of illegal online sales. âAfter a series of discussions on the seriousness of the illegal sales, KMCA and KIPO decided to resume the crackdown this year. Weâre planning on conducting three more large-scale clampdowns this year,ï¿½?KMCAâs policy & law lab Chief Director Kim Hyun-sook told The Korea Herald. According to Kim, a greater number of fake K-pop items are sold around the time of big-name artistsï¿½?offline concerts. But the buyers, most of whom are relatively young, find it difficult to distinguish counterfeit products from genuine items, she said. Ahead of the latest clampdown which began last month, both KIPO and KOIPA started their probes into online sales of illegal K-pop merchandise taking place overseas as well as offline sales of such products. Kim said taking action against online sellers of counterfeit goods is more complicated than punishing offline sellers. âAlthough (sales of the counterfeit K-pop merchandise) is a very serious issue, itâs very hard to regulate it. Securing all the evidence online is not that easy. An entertainment agency has to file a suit directly against an individual illegal seller, so agencies often think that they canât gain by doing so,ï¿½?Kim said.

342,1,Publicis Posts Solid Growth but Takes Russia Loss -- WSJ,473 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"That is despite the continuing pandemic, the conflict in Ukraine and the consequences of inflation for its clients, Publicis said. It said its first-quarter performance would ordinarily have led it to upgrade its expectations for the year, but those factors are creating too much uncertainty to do so now.  Publicis's decision last month to stop doing business in Russia and to transfer ownership of its agencies there to local management resulted in an EUR87 million exceptional disposal loss, equivalent to $94.2 million, in the first quarter. ""We are still very confident in our ability to deliver what we have promised in February,"" Chief Executive Arthur Sadoun said in an interview. The company expects to see organic growth, which strips out the effects of currency fluctuations, acquisitions and disposals, of 5% in the current quarter, he said. Mr. Sadoun last week said in a video to staff that he had undergone surgery for a cancerous tumor, but that the tumor was identified early and that there was no reason to worry. Mr. Sadoun said he was back to work and in the office. He plans to stay in Paris in May and June to continue treatment.  Publicis reported net revenue of EUR2.8 billion in the first quarter, up 17.1% from EUR2.4 billion in 2020. The company said a third of its net revenue is coming from its Epsilon and Publicis Sapient businesses, which it says are helping marketers shift away from tracking cookies and invest more in so-called ""owned"" media such as brands' social media feeds.  Alphabet Inc.'s Google plans to block the user-tracking technology called third-party cookies in its Chrome browser starting next year, driving many marketers to seek other ways of targeting customers. Social media, commerce platforms and branded content have meanwhile given brands new potential paths to reach customers, as audiences are declining for some paid ad channels such as traditional TV commercials.

38,0,4 men found dead at Mexican beach resort of Playa del Carmen,292 words,Associated Press Newswires,"But the fact the bodies were dumped together in the shrubs beside an access road suggested a gangland-style killing. Playa del Carmen has been hit by several instances of violence, most recently in January, when two Canadians were killed at a local resort, apparently because of debts between international drug and weapons trafficking gangs. There have been a series of brazen acts of violence along Mexicoâs resort-studded Mayan Riviera coast, the crown jewel of the countryâs tourism industry. In November, a shootout on the beach of Puerto Morelos, just north of Playa del Carmen, left two suspected drug dealers dead. Authorities said some 15 gunmen were from a gang that apparently disputed control of drug sales there. In late October, farther south in the laid-back destination of Tulum, two tourists ï¿½?one a California travel blogger born in India and the other German ï¿½?were caught in the apparent crossfire of rival drug dealers and killed. Also Thursday, prosecutors in the north-central state of Guanajuato ï¿½?long Mexico's most violent state ï¿½?said seven bodies had been found burned in the bed of a pickup truck. The truck was found on the side of the road near the city of Celaya, and another body was found nearby. Guanajuato has been the scene of bloody turf wars between the Jalisco cartel and local gangs."

730,0,Social media scrambles to rewrite playbook for wartime,1822 words,The Washington Post,"The moves illustrate how Internet platforms have been scrambling to adapt content policies built around notions of political neutrality to a wartime context. And they suggest that those rule books - the ones that govern who can say what online - need a new chapter on geopolitical conflicts. ""The companies are building precedent as they go along,"" says Katie Harbath, CEO of the tech policy consulting firm Anchor Change and a former public policy director at Facebook. ""Part of my concern is that we're all thinking about the short term"" in Ukraine, she says, rather than the underlying principles that should guide how platforms approach wars around the world. Moving fast in response to a crisis isn't a bad thing in itself. For tech companies that have become de facto stewards of online information, reacting quickly to global events, and changing the rules where necessary, is essential. On the whole, social media giants have shown an unusual willingness to take a stand against the invasion, prioritizing their responsibilities to Ukrainian users and their ties to democratic governments over their desire to remain neutral, even at the cost of being banned from Russia. The problem is that they're grafting their responses to the war onto the same global, one-size-fits-all frameworks that they use to moderate content in peacetime, says Emerson T. Brooking, a senior resident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. And their often opaque decision-making processes leave their policies vulnerable to misinterpretation and questions of legitimacy. The big tech companies now have playbooks for terrorist attacks, elections and pandemics - but not wars. What platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok need, Brooking argues, are not another hard-and-fast set of rules that can be generalized to every conflict, but a process and protocols for wartime that can be applied flexibly and contextually when fighting breaks out - loosely analogous to the commitments tech companies made to address terrorist content after the 2019 Christchurch massacre in New Zealand. Facebook and other platforms have also developed special protocols over the years for elections, from ""war rooms"" that monitor for foreign interference or disinformation campaigns to policies specifically prohibiting misinformation about how to vote, as well as for the covid-19 pandemic. The war in Ukraine should be the impetus for them to think in the same systematic way about the sort of ""break glass"" policy measures that may be needed specifically in cases of wars, uprisings, or sectarian fighting, says Harbath of Anchor Change - and about what the criteria would be for applying them, not only in Ukraine but in conflicts around the world, including those that command less public and media attention.  Facebook, for its part, has at least started along this path. The company says it began forming dedicated teams in 2018 to ""better understand and address the way social media is used in countries experiencing conflict,"" and that it has been hiring more people with local and subject-area expertise in Myanmar and Ethiopia. Still, its actions in Ukraine - which had struggled to focus Facebook's attention on Russian disinformation as early as 2015 - show it has more work to do.  The Atlantic Council's Brooking believes Facebook probably made the right call in instructing its moderators not to enforce the company's normal rules on calls for violence against Ukrainians expressing outrage at the Russian invasion. Banning Ukrainians from saying anything mean about Russians online while their cities are being bombed would be cruelly heavy-handed. But the way those changes came to light - via a leak to the news agency Reuters - led to mischaracterizations, which Russian leaders capitalized on to demonize the company as Russophobic. After an initial backlash, including threats from Russia to ban Facebook and Instagram, parent company Meta clarified that calling for the death of Russian leader Vladimir Putin was still against its rules, perhaps hoping to salvage its presence there. If so, it didn't work: A Russian court on Monday officially enacted the ban, and Russian authorities are pushing to have Meta ruled an ""extremist organization"" amid a crackdown on speech and media. In reality, Meta's moves appear to have been consistent with its approach in at least some prior conflicts. As Brooking noted in Slate, Facebook also seems to have relaxed its enforcement of rules against calling for or glorifying violence against the Islamic State in Iraq in 2017, against the Taliban in Afghanistan last year, and on both sides of the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 2020. If the company hoped that tweaking its moderation guidelines piecemeal and in secret for each conflict would allow it to avert scrutiny, the Russia debacle proves otherwise. Ideally, in the case of wars, tech giants would have a framework for making such fraught decisions in concert with experts on human rights, Internet access and cybersecurity, as well as experts on the region in question and perhaps even officials from relevant governments, Brooking suggests. In the absence of established processes, major social platforms ended up banning Russian state media in Europe reactively rather than proactively, framing it as compliance with the requests of the European Union and European governments. Meanwhile, the same accounts stayed active in the United States on some platforms, reinforcing the perception that the takedowns were not their choice. That risks setting a precedent that could come back to haunt the companies when authoritarian governments demand bans on outside media or even their own country's opposition parties in the future. Wars also pose particular problems for tech platforms' notions of political neutrality, misinformation and depictions of graphic violence. U.S.-based tech companies have clearly picked a side in Ukraine, and it has come at a cost: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and now Google News have all been blocked in Russia, and YouTube could be next. Yet the companies haven't clearly articulated the basis on which they've taken that stand, or how that might apply in other settings, from Kashmir to Nagorno-Karabakh, Yemen and the West Bank. While some, including Facebook, have developed comprehensive state-media policies, others have cracked down on Russian outlets without spelling out the criteria on which they might take similar actions against, say, Chinese state media. Harbath, the former Facebook official, says a hypothetical conflict involving China is the kind of thing that tech giants - along with other major Western institutions - should be planning ahead for now, rather than relying on the reactive approach they've used in Ukraine. ""This is easier said than done, but I'd like to see them building out the capacity for more long-term thinking,"" Harbath says. ""The world keeps careening from crisis to crisis. They need a group of people who are not going to be consumed by the day-to-day,"" who can ""think through some of the strategic playbooks"" they'll turn to in future wars.  Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have embraced the concept of ""misinformation"" as a descriptor for false or misleading content about voting, covid-19, or vaccines, with mixed results. But the war in Ukraine highlights the inadequacy of that term for distinguishing between, say, pro-Russian disinformation campaigns and pro-Ukrainian myths such as the ""Ghost of Kyiv."" Both may be factually dubious, but they play very different roles in the information battle. The platforms seem to understand this intuitively: There were no widespread crackdowns on Ukrainian media outlets for spreading what might fairly be deemed resistance propaganda. Yet they're still struggling to adapt old vocabulary and policies to such distinctions. For instance, Twitter justified taking down Russian disinformation about the Mariupol hospital bombings under its policies on ""abusive behavior"" and ""denying mass casualty events,"" the latter of which was designed for behavior such as Alex Jones' dismissal of the Sandy Hook shootings. YouTube cited an analogous 2019 policy on ""hateful"" content, including Holocaust denial, in announcing that it would prohibit any videos that minimize Russia's invasion. As for depictions of graphic violence, it makes sense for a platform such as YouTube to prohibit, say, videos of corpses or killings under normal circumstances. But in wars, such footage could be crucial evidence of war crimes, and taking it down could help the perpetrators conceal them.  YouTube and other platforms have exemptions to their policies for newsworthy or documentary content. And, to their credit, they seem to be treating such videos and images with relative care in Ukraine, says Dia Kayyali, associate director for advocacy at Mnemonic, a nonprofit devoted to archiving evidence of human rights violations. But that raises questions of consistency. ""They're doing a lot of things in Ukraine that advocates around the world have asked them for in other circumstances, that they haven't been willing to provide,"" Kayyali says. In the Palestinian territories, for instance, platforms take down ""a lot of political speech, a lot of people speaking out against Israel, against human rights violations."" Facebook has also been accused in the past of censoring posts that highlight police brutality against Muslims in Kashmir. Of course, it isn't only tech companies that have paid closer attention to - and taken a stronger stand on - Ukraine than other human rights crises around the world. One could say the same of the media, governments and the public at large. But for Silicon Valley giants that pride themselves on being global and systematic in their outlook - even if their actions don't always reflect it - a more coherent set of criteria for responding to conflicts seems like a reasonable ask. ""I would love to see the level of contextual analysis that Meta is doing for their exceptions to rules against urging violence to Russian soldiers, and to their allowance of praise for the Azov battalion"" - the Ukrainian neo-Nazi armed group that has been resisting the Russian invasion - applied to conflicts in the Arab-speaking world, Kayyali says. ""It's not too late for them to start doing some of these things in other places."""
777,0,How to tell if your email from social media giants is legit,551 words,Courier Mailï¿½?- âOnline,"Attempts to get back into their account were being thwarted because the hacker had changed the account email and contact number for notifications to his own. The business eventually determined what the source of the hack was. A staff member had received an email earlier in the week from âFacebook Supportï¿½?advising someone had raised a copyright report on one of the photographs on their page. A copy of a photograph that was on their page was included to make it look legitimate and there was a link to âappeal the reportï¿½? The person clicked the link. This wasnât the only business to be impacted by this kind of scam. IDCAREâs National Case Management Centre was receiving reports like this from people and businesses with large social media followers across the country this week. When a person clicked on the link, a page that appears identical to the Instagram login page popped up. Except this was a phoney page and the person was providing their login details directly to a hacker. The business received a text notification at 1.48am of unusual activity on their account and that someone was trying to login and change the account details. But they were sleeping and no one noticed until the next morning when it was too late. Trying to regain access to their account has been a process that has taken a few days. Unfortunately, scammers love targeting social media accounts because they know how dependent we have become on them. And Meta, the parent organisation of Facebook and Instagram, is striving to block them. In the third quarter of 2021, a Meta company spokesperson said they removed 1.8 billion fake accounts from their platforms and 99.8% of these were detected before they were even reported. This is a staggering figure. Meta is also doing more to raise awareness about the scams impacting Australians, partnering with the CCC and IDCARE to run a national scam awareness campaign. But while Meta is blocking the vast majority of scam attempts, we do need to take responsibility for our own safety too. A life jacket is only effective if you put it on when you go in the water. Meta has âstrongly encouraged people to strengthen their online security by turning on two-factor authentication, never share their password or account details, and turn on alerts for unrecognised loginsï¿½? But even these steps wonât always help when a person clicks on a phishing link in an email ï¿½?as this Queensland business did. There is an easy way to check if the email you have received from Facebook or Instagram is really from Facebook or Instagram in the settings in the app. Go to settings, go to security and go to emails from Instagram. If the email you have received isnât listed, delete it! Kathy Sundstrom is a former Sunshine Coast Daily journalist who now works at identity and cyber support service IDCARE."

U.S. authorities have accused China-based hackers for years of targeting a range of American businesses and government institutions. FBI Director Christopher Wray said this week that Beijing is running a ""massive, sophisticated hacking program that is bigger than those of every other major nation combined."" The FBI has more than 2,000 active investigations related to allegations of Chinese-government-directed theft of U.S. information or technology, Mr. Wray said. China has repeatedly denied allegations that it has carried out cyberattacks. In 2013, Chinese hackers trying to monitor news coverage of China hacked into the Journal's network, apparently aiming to spy on reporters covering China and other issues, the Journal reported. The New York Times had experienced a similar attack. At the time, a Chinese embassy spokesman condemned allegations of Chinese cyberspying. In February 2020, China revoked the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters based in Beijing. China's Foreign Ministry said the move was punishment for an opinion piece published by the Journal.

The following month, the Trump administration announced a personnel cap in the U.S. on four state-run Chinese media outlets.

Write to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com and Sadie Gurman at sadie.gurman@wsj.com 4 Feb 2022 09:41 ET Cyberattack on News Corp, Believed Linked to China, Targeted Emails of Journalists, Others -- 2nd Update By Alexandra Bruell and Sadie Gurman News Corp was the target of a hack that accessed emails and documents of some employees, including journalists, an incursion the company's cybersecurity consultant said was likely meant to gather intelligence to benefit China's interests. The attack, discovered on Jan. 20, affected a number of publications and business units including The Wall Street Journal and its parent Dow Jones; the New York Post; the company's U.K. news operation; and News Corp headquarters, according to an email the company sent to staff Friday. News Corp said it notified law enforcement and hired cybersecurity firm Mandiant Inc. to support an investigation. ""Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests,"" said David Wong, vice president of incident response at Mandiant. News Corp disclosed the hack in a securities filing Friday, saying its preliminary analysis indicates that data was taken. Representatives for the Chinese Embassy in Washington didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. News Corp said in the memo to staff it believes the threat activity is contained. The company has been offering guidance to affected employees. ""We are committed to protecting our journalists and sources. We will not be deterred from our purpose -- to provide uniquely trusted journalism and analysis. We will continue to publish the important stories of our time,"" said Almar Latour, chief executive of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal. The company's investigation indicates that systems housing financial and customer data, including subscriber information, weren't affected, according to the securities filing and a person familiar with the matter. Law-enforcement officials and cybersecurity experts say that journalists are often high-priority targets for hackers seeking to gain intelligence on behalf of foreign governments, because they speak to sources who might have valuable or sensitive information. Powerful surveillance tools have been used against journalists and human-rights activists. U.S. authorities have accused China-based hackers for years of targeting a range of American businesses and government institutions. FBI Director Christopher Wray said this week that Beijing is running a ""massive, sophisticated hacking program that is bigger than those of every other major nation combined."" The FBI has more than 2,000 active investigations related to allegations of Chinese-government-directed theft of U.S. information or technology, Mr. Wray said. China has repeatedly denied allegations that it has carried out cyberattacks. In 2013, Chinese hackers trying to monitor news coverage of China hacked into the Journal's network, apparently aiming to spy on reporters covering China and other issues, the Journal reported. The New York Times had experienced a similar attack. At the time, a Chinese embassy spokesman condemned allegations of Chinese cyberspying and said Beijing prohibits cyberattacks. In February 2020, China revoked the press credentials of three Journal reporters based in Beijing. China's Foreign Ministry said the move was punishment for an opinion piece published by the Journal. The three journalists work for the Journal's news operation, which operates with a strict separation from the opinion staff. The following month, the Trump administration announced a personnel cap in the U.S. on four state-run Chinese media outlets.

963,0,"U.S. News: Restaurants Struggle, Seek More Aid",746 words,The Wall Street Journal,"""I can't go into further debt to salvage this restaurant,"" said Dwayne Allen, owner of the Breadfruit & Rum Bar in Phoenix, who fell behind on his restaurant's rent after closing the business for long stretches during the pandemic. He said he has to pay his landlord in full by the end of January and has taken out a $48,000 loan to do so. ""I have no idea where that money is going to come from,"" said Mr. Allen, who signed the letter organized by the Independent Restaurant Coalition, an advocacy group for small operators formed in 2020 in response to the pandemic. Congress created a nearly $30 billion fund last year to help struggling restaurants, but the money ran out within weeks of its launch. Lobbyists for the industry, including the National Restaurant Association , pressed lawmakers to replenish the fund. ""In the outbreak of new variants, restaurants are the first ones to suffer,"" said Sean Kennedy, a vice president at the restaurant lobby, ""so there is heightened interest in moving on this."" Mr. Kennedy and other industry advocates have found support from Sens. Ben Cardin (D., Md.) and Roger Wicker (R., Miss.), who are working on a bill that would provide additional Covid-19 relief funding to a range of small businesses, including restaurants. No legislation has been introduced and any bill would likely face resistance from Republican lawmakers, who have said that Congress already doled out too much money to private industries during the pandemic. Restaurants are pressing their case almost two years after the pandemic first prompted authorities to mandate dining-room closures, mask wearing and, more recently, vaccination proof in some areas. U.S. food-service operators have seen an uneven recovery as fluctuating health restrictions continue to intersect with supply disruptions and labor shortages. Fast-food spots have generally recovered sales faster than full-service, sit-down restaurants. More than 63% of independent restaurants are full-service establishments, according to the NPD Group , a market research firm. Drive-throughs and to-go sales have helped many larger restaurant chains survive the pandemic's various challenges. Customer orders at full-service restaurants were nearly 18% lower in the year that ended in November compared with the same period before the pandemic, while orders at fast-food restaurants were down less than 2% over that period, according to NPD. The Omicron variant's spread could prolong some restaurants' difficulties, operators said. For the week that ended Dec. 1, U.S. restaurant seatings were 7% lower than 2019 levels, according to data from reservation service OpenTable Inc . By the end of the month, they were down 32% by the same metrics, according to the company. Some operators face new and returning Covid-19 rules as infections rise. Philadelphia, Chicago and Boston this month will join New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles and a handful of other jurisdictions requiring proof of vaccination to dine inside. Some of the financial assistance extended to restaurants earlier in the pandemic has begun to dry up. Local moratoriums on commercial evictions, such as those adopted to protect businesses in New York City and Seattle, are slated to expire on Jan. 15. Many independent restaurants say that consumer demand has improved from 2020 but that finding enough staff to stay open across all their operating hours, and generate sales, remains a problem. Mark Starr, owner of David's Pizza in Spokane, Wash., said his sales have rebounded from 2020, but his staff of 18 is down from 27 pre-pandemic. He said he often has to turn away customers during busy times and run catering orders himself because of the labor shortage. ""People talk like it's over,"" Mr. Starr said of the crisis. ""It is not."" --- Brody Mullins and Amara Omeokwe contributed to this article."

Ask an Analyst @Â https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/askus/rep-gb-2900[https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/askus/rep-gb-2900] ""The global molded fiber pulp packaging market is driven by surge in demand for sustainable packaging solutions with protective packaging characteristics. These solutions also are considered ideal for logistics and transport,""Â says an FMI analyst. <h2>Stringent Regulations Will Support Molded Fiber Pulp Packaging Sales</h2> As concerns regarding packaging waste continue to soar, regulatory bodies have implemented stringent measures to curb the use ofÂ single-use plastic.

76,1,EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: Feeling the Burn Of Higher Gas Prices --- Cigarette sales drop as fuel costs rise,522 words,The Wall Street Journal,"The volume of cigarettes sold in the U.S. over the four weeks through March 26 fell 9.4% from the year-earlier period, data from Nielsen shows. This is a deterioration from February's already weak volumes, which slipped 7.9% year-over-year. Tobacco sales have been volatile throughout the pandemic but the cost of gas is probably having an impact, too. Historically, U.S. cigarette volumes have moved inversely to fuel prices. Drivers are currently paying $4.10 a gallon on average, according to GasBuddy data. Prices have come down from highs seen in March, but a gallon today is still roughly 40% more expensive than it was this time last year -- multiples of the 8.5% rate of overall inflation. Pricier gas has an outsize impact on demand for cigarettes. Smokers tend to have lower incomes, so fuel costs take up a greater share of their disposable spending. Smoking prevalence among people earning less than $35,000 a year is 21.4% compared with just 7.1% for those earning more than $100,000. Cigarette sales are also sensitive to gasoline prices as the two are often purchased together. At least 60% of U.S. tobacco purchases are made in gas stations, according to Vivien Azer, an analyst at Cowen. Higher prices at the pump discourage impulse spending in gas station convenience stores. Pinched smokers are already trading down. The cheapest cigarette brands took 1.4 percentage points of market share from more expensive tobacco like Marlboro in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with a year earlier, based on Cowen data. Recent price increases by big tobacco firms may accelerate the trend. British American Tobacco, which makes Lucky Strike cigarettes, and Marlboro manufacturer Altria have increased prices eight and seven times, respectively, over the past two years, UBS notes. Historically, the two companies have raised prices around twice annually. Big tobacco companies are probably willing to sacrifice some market share in old-school smokes to maximize their profits. Cigarette companies are pouring billions of dollars into noncombustible products such as heated tobacco sticks and vape pens. This shift to so-called reduced risk products must be funded by their highly lucrative legacy business. Higher gas prices make it trickier to squeeze smokers for more cash to fund innovation without losing them to cheaper rivals. Tobacco stocks are performing well regardless. BAT is up almost one-fifth this year, while Altria has gained 16%. Even after the rally, their dividend yields are 7% -- more than quadruple the S&P 500 average. Generous payouts and the perceived defensive nature of tobacco stocks will remain a big lure, but investors should keep one eye on prices at the pump.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than May 3, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company.

The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, the Offering Documents were negligently prepared and, as a result, contained untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading and were not prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations governing their preparation. Additionally, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding C3.ai's business, operations, and compliance policies. Specifically, the Offering Documents and defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) C3.ai's partnership with Baker Hughes was deteriorating; (2) C3.ai's was employing a flawed accounting methodology to conceal the deterioration of its Baker Hughes partnership; (3) C3.ai faced challenges in product adoption and significant salesforce turnover; (4) C3.ai overstated, inter alia, the extent of its investment in technology, description of its customers, its total addressable market, the pace of its market growth, and the scale of alliances with its major business partners; and (5) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

190,1,"LIC IPO: Centre Wooing Sovereign, Pension Funds",461 words,The Economic Times - Delhi Edition,"FINALISING ANCHOR INVESTORSNew Delhi : India has sounded out Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Singapore-based GIC, three Canadian pension funds and Qatar Investment Authority among other sovereign wealth funds and pension funds on being anchor investors in Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India's initial public offer (IPO). The funds had shown interest and the government wants to confirm their participation, said officials involved in the offer. ET had reported earlier this week that the IPO is likely to be held toward the end of this month. ""Many leading sovereign funds have expressed interest in the LIC IPO. Merchant bankers are in advanced discussions with them for being anchor investors in the issue,"" one of the officials told ET. The government is keen on their participation as these funds are stable investors with a long-term horizon, the person said. The government had reached out to about 180 potential anchor investors during roadshows. Officials feel at least 8-10 big-ticket foreign investors will be required as anchor investors for the IPO, set to be the biggest ever Indian public offer. In December last year, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had extended the lock-in period for anchor investors to 90 days from 30 days earlier. The market re- gulator also removed restrictions on the maximum number of anchor investors for public issues in excess of ` 250 crore. At an estimated embedded value of ` 5.4 lakh crore, the Centre may raise ` 60,000-70,000 crore through the 5% stake sale in LIC. The anchor investment portion is expected to be around ` 18,000 crore. According to the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) filed with Sebi, the insurer will allocate 60% of the qualified institutional buyers' (QIBs) portion to anchor investors on a discretionary basis. Strong anchor investments give confidence to retail and other institutional investors, helping generate demand for IPO when it opens to the general public. The official said that while the discussions were going on, there is still no firm commitment on the quantum of the investment they were likely to make. ""That will happen when we ze ro in on the final issue price and when it is communicated to them. The process is on and we will do it soon,"" the official said, without giving a timeline. One key consideration is the listing price and the market capitalisation at that level. Anything below ` 10.7 lakh crore valuation at listing can make inclusion in the MSCI index difficult, said the official. The government has budgeted Rs 65,000 crore from disinvestment in the current financial year."

749,1,Clean Eatz Closes Out Q1 on Track for Record Year of Growth,635 words,PR Newswire,"Having started the year with 69 units in operation, the brand's first quarter saw a rate of growth that neared 10 percent after closing out March with 76 locations now up and running. A clear step in the right direction for the Clean Eatz team, who have previously stated their year-end goal as being to have 100 units in existence, as well as an additional 100 in development. As it currently stands, the franchise has over 80 units in development, 10 of those agreements stemming from their work these past few months. The franchise was able to establish a presence this past quarter in Omaha, NE, Pittsburgh, PA, Austin, TX, Boston, MA and Indianapolis, IN, effectively extending its reach to more consumers than ever and keeping in line with the company's vision of reaching their east coast roots all the way to the nation's western shores in the near future. Clean Eatz currently has plans in development that will see the franchise's first locations take shape in Houston, TX, Daytona Beach, FL, Dayton, OH and Reading, PA as the year progresses. ""It's impossible to have a strong year without a solid start, and the beginning of 2022 was a good one for Clean Eatz. Opening locations across the country not only helps our growth as a brand but it helps everyone begin the journey of prioritizing their health,"" said Don Varady, Co-Founder of Clean Eatz. ""Our goal is to change the lives of our franchisees, and the people that walk into Clean Eatz every day. We further that mission by meeting growth expectations, and it's encouraging to see that 2022 is on the right track."" The restaurant industry has been ripe with challenges this year, impacting both current and new franchisees. Significant supply chain issues, nationwide labor shortages, an exceptionally competitive real estate market, and increasing construction costs have proven to be very real factors combating the brand's previously stated goals for the year. However, the Clean Eatz team has persevered and has been able to provide resources and guidance to its system of franchisees, effectively propelling them forward through these rough waters.

476,0,Will pricier Big Macs equal fewer U.S. customers at McDonald's?,499 words,Reuters News,"Franchisees can set their own prices, which vary by region, with a Big Mac, soft drink and large fries costing nearly $10 in New York City. McDonald's Corp, among the first major restaurant chains to report fourth quarter results, is expected to report a 6.9% increase in U.S. comparable sales growth, down slightly from estimates of 7% two weeks ago. It reported 9.6% growth in the third quarter. The chain's U.S. menu prices have increased 2.7% over the last three months, according to Gordon Haskett analysts. Some McDonald's franchisees now say more expensive sandwiches are hurting foot traffic and sales, according to independent analyst Mark Kalinowski's survey of operators, published Monday. ""Is there an inflection point at which customers start deciding it's not worth paying $9.50 for a burrito, it's not worth paying $7 for a hamburger?"" said Morningstar analyst Sean Dunlop. Weekly visits to many fast-food restaurants have been falling in recent weeks, according to Placer.ai, which tracks cell phone location data. McDonald's visits started dropping in mid-December and fell 12.6% in the week ended Jan. 10 versus 2019 levels, the analytics firm said. And fast-food menu prices could increase another 6% to 8% in 2022, according to Wedbush Securities. To be sure, consumers have had pent-up spending power after saving money at the start of the pandemic and later getting cash injections from government rescue aid. Several chains including Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and Popeyes' parent company Restaurant Brands International Inc have so far reported little resistence to higher menu prices. ""We haven't seen much pushback yet on the price taken in 2021,"" Restaurant Brands CEO Jose Cil said during an investor conference on Monday. ""The key is not to get too far ahead of the consumer."" Restaurants face multiple pressures including COVID-related staffing shortages, limited seating and reduced hours on top of bad winter weather and normally slow January sales. McDonald's is expected to use its new digital rewards program to grab market share from smaller rivals, including Restaurant Brands' Burger King. McDonald's huge scale lets it ""defray the costs of really heavy investments in technology across an enormous sales base and swallow those costs better than a lot of smaller peers,"" Dunlop said.

90,0,UPDATE 3-Burger King says Russia operator 'refused' to shutter restaurants,472 words,Reuters News,"NEW YORK, March 18 (Reuters) - Burger King's parent company said on Thursday it has not been able to close its 800 restaurants in Russia because its independent operator there ""refused"" to do so.  Restaurant Brands International Inc said that to enforce its contracts with the partner, Alexander Kolobov, it would need the help of the Russian government, but ""we know that will not practically happen anytime soon,"" according to a letter to employees from David Shear, president, international, of the company. Kolobov said in a statement to Reuters that he does not have the authority or power to decide whether to suspend restaurant operations. Shear's long letter and Kolobov's response highlight the many complications bedeviling some American fast-food brands as they try to halt operations in Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. It also exposes what can become a point of weakness in international franchising, which is how most American restaurant brands expand overseas: the relationships with their independent operators. On March 8, Starbucks Corp and a wave of other companies followed McDonald's Corp in saying they would suspend or limit operations in Russia. Like Burger King, Starbucks does not own or operate its more than 100 cafes there. But unlike Burger King, it had a willing partner - Kuwait-based Alshaya Group - that immediately agreed to shut its Starbucks' locations in Russia and support its 2,000 employees.  Restaurant Brands entered Russia a decade ago through a joint venture partnership with three entities: Kolobov, who controls day-to-day operations, private equity and asset management firm Investment Capital Ukraine, and Russia's state-owned VTB Bank, which has been hit by Western sanctions.  Restaurant Brands has started the process to dispose of its 15% ownership stake in the joint venture. It wants to do so immediately, Shear said, but it will take ""some time"" based on the terms of the agreement. There are ""no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement,"" Shear wrote. ""Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today?"" he wrote. ""No."" Kolobov said he has never had control of operations since the joint venture formed in 2012. He controls 30% of the partnership and said the decision to suspend operations ""must be taken by all shareholders considering the impact it may have"" on approximately 25,000 employees.

125,0,Surge of Covid-19 Cases Prompts Lockdowns in China,1425 words,The New York Times,"China is grappling with its largest surge of Covid-19 infections since the coronavirus first emerged more than two years ago in central China. Sustained outbreaks in two-thirds of the country's provinces are proving the toughest test yet of China's zero-tolerance coronavirus policy. Even as countries in the West are now loosening or abandoning mask mandates and other measures, Chinese officials are implementing some of their most stringent methods. That is in large part because China can't afford to lift restrictions. The government has been concerned about comparatively lower rates of vaccination among China's older adults. The country also has far fewer intensive care hospital beds compared to its population than most industrialized countries. In China's vast rural areas, hospitals and medical facilities are often basic, and a major outbreak could quickly overwhelm hospitals. The United States and other Western countries have suffered far higher rates of infection and deaths over the past two years than China, and still have higher rates now. But the seven-day average rate of new cases in mainland China, now at 1,584, has more than quintupled in recent days. For many residents in China, the rapid spread of the virus has been unsettling. ''Because of the large number of cases in a short period of time, it is inevitable that there will be some panic all over the country, and Shanghai is no exception,'' said Dr. Zhang Wenhong, a prominent infectious disease expert in Shanghai, in a post on his social media account on Monday. China has responded to the current surge in cases by mobilizing its vast Communist Party apparatus to deploy workers and resources. In Jilin Province, where many cases have been recorded, workers are building temporary facilities to house thousands of people who test positive. Across the country, workers are corralling and testing millions of citizens every day. But that testing program is starting to be overwhelmed. ''We have noticed that there have been problems such as long lines and slow test results at many testing sites in the past two days,'' said Lu Taohong, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, at a news conference on Sunday night. China's virus containment strategy is focused on moving quickly to lock down buildings or neighborhoods. In response to even a single case, officials may seal all the entrances to a store, office building or even convention center. Everyone inside must then stay there for up to several days as they are tested for the coronavirus and sent into isolation if their results are positive. In Shanghai, many foreign-owned businesses stockpiled mattresses last week in case their employees were trapped in their factories or their offices this week. Multinationals there then told their employees to work from home this week. In Guangzhou, the municipal government on Friday sealed off the world's largest convention center, which was holding a beauty products exhibition. Videos circulating on Chinese social media platforms showed crowds of stranded convention goers milling around and looking for exits in attempts to evade the lockdown. The outbreak's rapid spread and the government's tough response have left some residents worried about the effect of lockdowns on their livelihoods. Li Yanhua, a grocery store manager in Shanghai, was notified on Saturday night that his neighborhood was locked down and residents would have to be tested for Covid. ''It was all of a sudden, we are not even prepared -- my family has not enough vegetables and daily necessities,'' Mr. Li said. ''My store is closed, but we still need to pay rent.'' Still, such measures have also been widely accepted as necessary for the good of public health. Li Junyan, a 33-year-old businessman in the locked down city of Changchun in northeastern China, has had to stop shipping fruit and health products to online customers because of travel restrictions but he is philosophical about it. ''There must be losses to my business, but there is nothing much I can do,'' he said. He and the other three other members of his family have been confined at their apartment since Saturday. ''In order not to cause chaos to the society, I'll stay at home for the public's sake.'' Faye Li, 27, a brand management specialist at a food company in Shenzhen, said she wanted to spend time downtown over the weekend with two friends but canceled the plan because the government banned indoor dining. But she accepted this. ''The effect of the outbreak is small, and I'm actually not very worried, '' Ms. Li said. ''I've been used to this.'' Chinese doctors and health officials insist that continued mass testing, quarantines and lockdowns are necessary. Opening up too soon could be disastrous, they warn. Many of the cases in recent days have been the Omicron variant, which while highly transmissible, has also tended to make people less sick than earlier variants of the coronavirus. A little more than half of those infected with the coronavirus in recent days in China do not show symptoms, according to data released by the government. But they are still infectious. ''The proportion of asymptomatic infections is high, the spread is hidden, and early detection is difficult,'' said Wu Fan, vice dean of Shanghai Medical College at Fudan University, at a government news conference on Sunday. ''It is not enough to simply screen in key areas or populations -- it is necessary to reduce or slow down the mobility of people.'' After scandals involving citywide lockdowns in which people went hungry in their homes or even died for lack of medical care, notably in Xi'an, central government leaders have ordered local officials to use greater caution when imposing such restrictions. Premier Li Keqiang said in an annual policy speech last week that the goal of China's pandemic policies was ''to protect people's life and health, keep up the normal running of work and life, and ensure the security of industrial and supply chains.'' But the rapid increase in infections threatens to undo that progress. Dr. Zhang, the Shanghai expert, has been one of the few prominent advocates of easing ''Covid zero'' precautions, but even he said in an online posting on Monday that now is not the time for that. ''It is very important for our country to continue to adopt the strategy of covid-zero in the society in the near future to suppress the fifth wave of the extremely fast-spreading Omicron epidemic to a completely controllable level,'' he wrote. ''But this does not mean that we will permanently adopt the strategy of citywide lockdown and full testing.'' Shenzhen, a vast metropolis of nearly 20 million people that is China's tech center and adjacent to Hong Kong, locked down residents on Sunday night. It stopped buses and subways and ordered businesses to close except for supermarkets, farmers' markets, pharmacies, medical institutions and the port, which is one of the world's largest. Dongguan, another huge factory city that is next to Shenzhen, imposed a similar lockdown on Monday. Particularly in southern China, many have reacted to the Omicron outbreak by blaming nearby Hong Kong, where a large epidemic has overwhelmed hospitals and morgues, largely because the vaccination of older residents has lagged. Hu Xijin, a nationalistic columnist, complained in a post on his social media account on Sunday: ''Hong Kong brought down Shenzhen.'' Li You, Amy Chang Chien, and Joy Dong contributed research.

In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, the IPO offering documents and defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) top-line data of the Phase 1 Clinical Trial indicated that DSG3-CAART had, among other things, worsened certain participants' disease activity scores and necessitated additional systemic medication to improve disease activity after DSG3-CAART infusion; (2) accordingly, DSG3-CAART was not as effective as the Company had represented to investors; (3) therefore, the Company had overstated DSG3-CAART's clinical and/or commercial prospects; and (4) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

97,0,BGH ruling: No lockdown compensation for restaurateurs,743 words,Die Welt translated into English,"Closed restaurants, empty hotel rooms - like so many restaurateurs, the Corona lockdown hit Diedersdorf Castle in Brandenburg hard. The family-run business with a hotel and several restaurants had to record around 5500 euros in losses during the first wave of the pandemic alone. And that was on a daily basis. In court, the operators therefore wanted the state of Brandenburg to compensate them for the loss of income. The Federal Court of Justice (BGH) has now issued a landmark ruling in this case - with a signal effect for all German businesses. According to the ruling, those affected by the Corona lockdowns are not entitled to state compensation. Providing assistance to economic sectors severely affected by the pandemic is not a matter of state liability, said presiding judge Ulrich Herrmann when delivering the verdict. The principle of the welfare state only implies a duty to provide compensation within the state. The form this takes is left to the legislature. During the pandemic, the state fulfilled this obligation through the various Corona aid programs, the judges argued. After all, there were billions of dollars in funds. Since the start of the pandemic, some 66 billion euros in Corona grants have flowed to those affected. More than half of this was accounted for by the so-called bridging aid I to IV. In each case, the state spent more than 13 billion euros as emergency aid and as so-called November/December aid, as current figures from the Federal Ministry of Finance show. From the point of view of Brandenburg's hotel and restaurant operators, however, the aid was not enough to compensate for the costs. The sum received, amounting to 60,000 euros, covered just eleven days, as the plaintiffs' lawyer said in the previous negotiations. The trial was initially about a claim for an additional 27,000 euros from the state. The exact amount of damages would have had to be determined subsequently. It is true that numerous similar cases are still pending before the German courts. But with the BGH ruling, the hopes of all those affected to make the state liable for losses should now finally fade. To contain the spread of the coronavirus, the federal and state governments had repeatedly adopted drastic measures. Restaurants, bars and clubs had to remain closed for weeks in the past two years. Hotels were no longer allowed to take in tourists. Only out-of-home sales remained permitted. The Brandenburg restaurateurs' lawsuit was also unsuccessful in the lower courts. Last June, the Brandenburg Higher Regional Court ruled that the Corona pandemic was ""a major damaging event that affected and continues to affect society as a whole and large sections of the economy "". The ""socially acceptable distribution of the pandemic-related unequal burdens"" was therefore ""primarily a challenge for the welfare state."" The highest judges in Karlsruhe have now followed this opinion. The BGH also explained that no more far-reaching compensation could be derived from the Infection Protection Act. However, companies can at least be reimbursed for wage costs if the authorities have ordered a quarantine for employees. If employees cannot work because of the quarantine, companies are usually reimbursed for the lost time. The condition is that Those affected have been vaccinated against Corona. The state also usually pays for employees who cannot work because they have to care for their isolated children. Based on the number of applications, however, many companies have not yet made use of this option. in 2021, the states received only slightly more than 1.3 million applications. At the same time, however, more than 5.4 million people in this country were infected with the coronavirus. But Brandenburg restaurateurs are left with a sense of injustice. ""We acted in accordance with the law and invested a lot of money in hygiene measures,"" said managing director Salina Worm during the trial. The proceedings have now been legally concluded with the verdict of the supreme civil court judges. Now the plaintiffs have only one option left: an appeal to the Federal Constitutional Court."

715,0,New York Times Pulls Editorial Staff From Russia Following 'Fake News' Law,511 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"The law--a change to the country's criminal code, which the lower chamber of Russia's parliament approved on Friday--says anyone found guilty of knowingly disseminating false information and data about the use of Russia's armed forces would be punished by a prison sentence of up to 15 years or a fine of up to 1.5 million rubles, equivalent to about $10,500. The Times's move comes after a number of news organizations took action in response to the new law. CNN on Friday said it would stop broadcasting in Russia, while the British Broadcasting Corp. and Bloomberg News decided to suspend the work of their journalists inside the country. The Washington Post on Saturday said it would remove bylines and datelines from certain articles as it continues to seek clarity about whether Russia's new restrictions apply to international news organizations.  Dow Jones & Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal, had no immediate comment on Tuesday. On Friday, a Dow Jones spokesman said: ""Our top priorities are the safety of our employees and covering this important story fairly and fully.

342,0,[EXCLUSIVE] 'Zombie tower' Dark days in struggle over 'empty' T.Sq. hotel,560 words,New York Post,"SL Green wants a Manhattan Supreme Court judge to appoint a receiver to manage the whole property, reopen the 795-room hotel and collect the revenue to pay off the obligations - including ground rent that it says Argent owes to SL Green. According to Green's court filing, Argent owes a total of over $16 million in property taxes and tens of millions more for labor, water and other charges. Green views a receiver as necessary to safeguard the building's future and also to protect its investment in the land.  SL Green's court move is a counterpunch to debt holder Argent, which is owned by investor Â­Arnold Penson. The Crowne Plaza closed in March 2020. In December 2020, Argent bought the debt owed by Vornado Realty Trust, which was the hotel building's managing partner and investment manager, at a deep discount - $90 million for a $195 million mortgage - The Real Deal reported at the time. Vornado defaulted on a total $274.35 million in debt on the site, according to the company's 10-K SEC filing in December 2021. Vornado owned all the land under the building except for the small slice purchased by SL Green. It snatched up the 11,000-square-foot parcel - about one-quarter of the total ground footprint - for $121 million in September 2021. A manager installed by Penson then sued in an attempt to invalidate the purchase, claiming his company had first refusal rights on any land sale. But SL Green says that under long-standing agreements at the location, first-refusal rights were reserved only for the ""tenant"" - i.e. Vornado, which declined to match SL Green's offer. Argent, SL Green claims, is not a tenant because it never took legal possession of the leasehold. It declined to hold a universal commercial-code debt auction - which it could have done and would have allowed it to take title. Instead, it replaced Vornado managers with its own people while ""ignoring"" all of its obligations, ""such as paying contractors, utilities, taxes and rent,"" according to SL Green's court filing. But Richard Shinder, president of the Vornado-owned entity that still legally owns the property, said ""SL Green's deliberate choice to acquire a portion of the Times Square Crowne Plaza building in violation of [the Vornado entity's] right of first refusal has forced [us] to commence litigation to enforce its contractual rights."""
174,0,"Makers of basic necessities face 'tradeoff' supplying Russia with cookies, soap",886 words,Reuters News,"But the world's biggest makers of packaged food items and household basics have lagged some financial services firms, oil and gas companies and retailers that withdrew entirely from Russia. The consumer products companies argue that everyday people in Russia rely on their products.  Procter & Gamble Co and Unilever Plc said this week they are continuing to sell essential products in Russia, but are ending any new capital investments and are no longer advertising in the country. Unilever has suspended all imports and exports of products into and out of the country. Packaged food maker Nestle SA and dairy company Danone SA are taking similar approaches. ""I give them credit for doing more today than they did yesterday,"" said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld , a professor at the Yale School of Management who is tracking major companies' moves to withdraw from Russia. ""The more comprehensive the pullout, the more youâre advancing the prospects of world peace."" Sonnenfeld added that it was a ""mistake"" to try to minimize the damage to Russian people by continuing to supply basics. ""There's no middle ground,"" he said. Cadbury chocolate maker Mondelez International Inc and Kimberly-Clark Corp , which produces Huggies diapers, have yet to announce plans to curtail production in Russia. âItâs not about pure profits,ï¿½?said Katie Denis, a spokeswoman for the Consumer Brands Association , a trade group representing companies including P&G and Mondelez . âItâs about, are you going to continue producing things people need? Itâs different than what companies who came out earlier are dealing with.ï¿½?WORTH THE RISK? Companies also do not want to be seen as harming regular Russian citizens by putting them out of work. At least six major fast-food companies ï¿½?including Yum Brands Inc's KFC and Restaurant Brands International 's Burger King ï¿½?run more than 2,500 restaurants in Russia, mostly through franchisees, and employ tens of thousands more people, according to a Reuters tally that does not include McDonald's . None of the companies so far have announced plans to withdraw from Russia. Investors such as the New York State pension fund want companies to consider whether continuing to do business in Russia is worth the risks. Asset manager Federated Hermes is pressing companies in phone calls and letters to be ""open and transparent about what they do in Russia"" and share ""what decision-making process they've gone through to come up with a conclusion"" on working in the country, said Hannah Shoesmith, director of engagement at the firm. Federated Hermes is targeting consumer products companies in its outreach, Shoesmith said. ""We wouldn't ask companies to just leave Russia without asking them to assess the impact on human rights,"" Shoesmith said. ""There's a tradeoff companies have to make. It's not so black and white."" Companies also ""should start to think carefully"" about their position on taxes paid to the Russian government, Shoesmith said. ""There are attempts to come up with good solutions around paying tax,"" she said. ""If they pay tax in Russia, what are the solutions they can come up with to make up the balance on that?"" Shoesmith said that in prior military coups and refugee crises, companies made payments equivalent to their tax bills to nongovernmental organizations aimed at helping people. 'CORPORATE SUICIDE' ""There's a big move in our industry to focus on companies with strong corporate governance and ethical standards - and that means societal issues as well,"" said Jack Martin, investment manager at Oberon Investments , which holds shares in Unilever , Diageo Plc , Burberry Group Plc and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE . ""It's corporate suicide, really, at the moment, to not pull back from the region."" Joe Sinha, chief marketing officer for Parnassus Investments in San Francisco, said his firm has no direct exposure to Russian companies, but that it is reaching out to the U.S. portfolio companies it owns with more than 2% or so of revenue exposure to Russia to ask for details about their thinking on whether to stay or leave the country. ""Weâre not being prescriptive, weâre trying to understand their roles and choices,ï¿½?Sinha said. While Parnassus is supportive of steps like sanctions that cut off Russian banks and technology firms close to the military, he said, the analysis could be different for food companies that serve consumers. âFor certain goods and services it would harm individual citizens who donât have anything to do with the regime,ï¿½?he said. âThere are gray areas.ï¿½?(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York and Richa Naidu in London Additional reporting by Hilary Russ in New York and Ross Kerber in Boston Editing by Vanessa O'Connell and Matthew Lewis)"

261,0,"On the road from Kharkiv, checkpoints and a resolve to fight Russians",1033 words,The Washington Post,"Though we had been deeply invested in Kharkiv's story, as we had been based in the city since before the start of Russia's invasion, we decided there was safety in numbers and linked up with another group of journalists to drive together in two cars to Dnipro, about 140 miles to the southwest. Google Maps said it would be about a three-hour drive. Ukrainians across the country have had to consider a similar choice: stay put and risk a Russian assault, or hit the road and face unpredictable and potentially even more unsafe conditions while driving. We were fortunate to have the resources to make an exit - an option not available to all in Kharkiv. City streets were deserted as we left Kharkiv. They had been bustling with rush-hour traffic just five days earlier. One car frantically drove around us. The driver yelled out his window that we were going too slow. Artillery strikes could still be heard in the distance. But we had grown used to that sound after four days of enduring shelling here. Apparently locals had, too. As we drove, we saw a line of more than 100 people outside a grocery store. Sheltering in basements and underground metro platforms for four days had left people desperate to restock on supplies. The booming thuds, then still seemingly far away, didn't prompt them to abandon their positions in line. We knew we should expect armed checkpoints on our journey to Dnipro, and we encountered our first one at the edge of the city center. Men dressed in military-style uniforms had set up barricades along the road and directed us to pull over. Everyone in our car was wearing a protective vest as a precaution. I was driving, so I tried to cover my vest with a scarf so as to not alarm the soldiers, who were already on edge at these checkpoints. There were four people in our car, but he asked to see just one passport. Satisfied that it was American, he let us pass. At the next one, we were all asked to show our passports and also open the trunk. It was unclear if these checkpoints were manned by members of the armed forces or civilian militia volunteers. We saw plenty of the latter walking around Kharkiv and along highways on our trip. They were dressed in street clothes while carrying firearms. We pulled off at one gas station about 90 minutes into the journey, but it was out. We were about to continue on when I noticed more than 10 men with their rifles raised crossing the street to surround our two cars. Our colleague in the other vehicle opened his door to get out, and I heard one of the men yell in Russian: ""Get in the car!"" I told the people in my car to stay still and silent. These members of a Ukrainian militia had seen one of our colleagues take a photo of a gas station sign and thought he might be documenting their movements to pass on to the Russians. Our colleagues kept their hands up while explaining the misunderstanding. When the militia members came to my car, I showed them my passport and assured them we wouldn't be photographing anything. They let us leave. The next checkpoint we encountered was friendlier. Soldiers asked our two cars to pull over to make way for a Ukrainian military vehicle passing behind us. At the center of the checkpoint, a gunman peered through his scope to ensure the truck passed through safely. Then when they saw our passports, they cheered that we were from a country that has supported Ukraine with more than $2.7 billion in military aid. One soldier raised his fist and said he was ready to ""kill Russians."" The drive continued. Many road signs had been taken down or were covered in paint - an attempt to confuse Russian forces. On one sign, someone drew a U-turn arrow and labeled it ""Moscow."" We were able to refuel in Novomuskovsk, where life seemed surprisingly normal. Along the way, we had seen a crater left from an artillery shell. But here, just 15 miles north of Dnipro, the traffic lights still worked. There was no wait for gas or at any of the grocery stores. During this brief break in driving, I saw the updates on my phone about what had transpired in Kharkiv just after we departed. Civilian areas were devastated by Russian artillery strikes - possibly cluster munitions, which disperse submunitions or bomblets. At least 11 people were confirmed dead, with many more injured. I then thought of all of those people who had left safety because they needed groceries. We continued to scan the reports out of Kharkiv while stuck in more than two hours of traffic for our last checkpoint. My colleagues - one a photographer and other a video journalist - tried to capture the scene of the road congestion to get to Dnipro. But when we finally made it to the checkpoint, the soldier asked our car to pull over. He had our license plate written down on a piece of paper. ""We heard your car was taking pictures,"" he said. I assured him that we were journalists. He asked for all of us to get out of the car so he could search it. But after a quick glance into the trunk, he let his pass, ushering us forward into Dnipro. The normally three-hour trip had taken six hours."

Bagala had been drinking heavily, breaking things and harassing guests at the Lake Hotel on Sept. 25 when a ranger was called, Wyoming U.S. District Attorney L. Robert Murray said in a statement Wednesday. Ranger Matthew Chuvarsky arrived to find broken plexiglass and Bagala threatening to fight with him. Chuvarsky used a Taser on Bagala and handcuffed him outside the hotel, according to Chuvarsky's report of the arrest filed in federal court in Wyoming. Bagala had cuts on his hands and rangers put him in an ambulance. On the drive to a hospital in Livingston, Montana, Bagala unbuckled himself and struggled with another ranger, according to Chuvarsky. The ranger who was driving had to stop and help control Bagala by using a Taser on him again. A paramedic subdued Bagala with ketamine but by then Bagala had struggled with five rangers and the paramedic, Chuvarsky wrote. Rangers documented other damage, including broken doors and light fixtures, totaling $2,865, according to Carman. Carman ordered Bagala to pay that amount in restitution. Bagala's attorney, Tom Fleener, didn't immediately return a phone message Thursday seeking comment."
923,1,Gangar Eyenation to Expand in Several Tier II and III Cities,415 words,NewsVoir,"Jigar Gangar, Director of Gangar Eyenation Whether or not, the demand for offline stores is still relevant for today tech-driven online shopper, Jigar Gangar, Director of Gangar Eyenation says, The category of lenses and eyewear is paramedical and hence it is difficult to give prescriptions as eye testing is not advisable to conduct online. Moreover, every eyewear user has a different face shape and size so it becomes very tough to suggest the right product online which may not be comfortable for the buyer. And hence, offline testing and buying are still preferred and advisable when it comes to eye-wear. Speaking about diving into tier II III markets which are dominated mostly by unorganized players, Jigar Gangar says, Our industry as a whole is 20% organized and 80% unorganized. We plan on beating the competition by spreading awareness on eye health, and offering modern and effective solutions. Focusing on the brand vision of spreading awareness and early detection, the stores will be equipped with modern eye-testing technology and quality customer service. The reality is that 80% of the blind in India could have saved their eyesight if preventive steps were taken in time. By the time they seek medical remedy, their eyesight gets severely impaired. Through our stores, we will endeavor to spread awareness about early detection and timely remedy among our fellow citizens, Gangar adds. Gangar Eyenation offers the widest range of genuine, international, and national brands, and is an exclusive dealer of fashion brands such as Bentley, Maybach, Cartier, Gucci, Mont Blanc, Armani, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, and Carrera catering to all customer segments. Through its new stores, the company will continue to offer high-quality international labels to brand-conscious consumers in tier II III markets. As a part of its expansion strategy, the company plans to retain existing customers, while making new ones, through a loyalty program which comes across as a customer delight.Currently, it has one million customers across its existing stores in Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Goa. >"

744,0,Biden disdains Fox News ï¿½?but still wants to reach its audience,887 words,Washington Post.com,"Those condemnations notwithstanding, the Biden team has seen fit to slide occasional exclusives to the network. Since Biden articulated his Murdoch assessment in mid-2021, the world has received a contextual reset on dangerous men: It's hard to beat Russian President Vladimir Putin, author of the invasion of Ukraine and its many alleged war crimes. As media moguls go, however, Murdoch represents an enduring threat to a cohesive American democracy, as channeled every night through the hateful rantings of prime-time host Tucker Carlson. What's notable about Biden's quip, however, is that it was made in private. That's because the president appears to have made a deliberate decision not make such comments publicly ï¿½?despite his occasional skirmishes with Fox News correspondents, most notably briefing room mainstay Peter Doocy. In an October 2021 CNN town hall, Biden joked, ""And you know what I find fascinating? I turn on Fox to find out how popular I am."" And in a rambling January news conference, Biden addressed cable news and the country's polarization. Americans ""go to get reinforced in their views, whether it's MSNBC or whether it's Fox,"" said Biden. ""I do know that we have sort of a ï¿½?put everybody in ï¿½?put themselves in certain alleys and they've decided that, you know, how many people who watch MSNBC also watch Fox other than a politician trying to find out what's going on in both places."" Is there any more milquetoast commentary than lamenting both sides' cable news attachments? The last Democratic president to face Fox News's propaganda was Barack Obama, whose administration took aim at Fox News from its early days. The president himself called the network ""destructive"" in a 2010 interview and kept up the candid, withering media criticism. After Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, Obama lamented, ""In this election, [they] turned out in huge numbers for Trump. And I think that part of it has to do with our inability, our failure, to reach those voters effectively. Part of it is Fox News in every bar and restaurant in big chunks of the country, but part of it is also Democrats not working at a grass-roots level, being in there, showing up, making arguments."" The peril of presidents attacking Fox News emerged after that last Obama quote, as the network extracted plenty of programming from his comments. Then-host Megyn Kelly said, ""In a wide-ranging sit-down, Mr. Obama talked about his legacy, the president-elect and what happened with the election. When he was specifically pressed on the Democrat's shellacking, the president said it was not his policies or his party. Instead, he blamed Fox News."" (Actually, Obama blamed both.) Others at Fox News also made hay of Obama's commentary. Instead of working against Fox News, the Biden White House has worked with the network from time to time. Case in point: On March 10, Fox News digital politics reporter Brooke Singman scored an exclusive on a large group of former state-level attorneys general endorsing the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. The network declined to comment on how it got the exclusive, though it's hard to see how it could have happened without the involvement of the White House. Another Singman exclusive previewed Biden's remarks about law enforcement at his State of the Union address, including his opposition to defunding the police. The friendly treatment of Murdoch's network predates Biden's inauguration. In September 2020, the network's website published an exclusive on Biden endorsements from law enforcement officials and just weeks later did a piece ï¿½?this one not marked as an exclusive ï¿½?on Biden endorsements from former Republican national security officials. One of the Biden campaign's digital advisers told the New York Times, ""The headlines from the sources that were the most surprising were the ones that had the most impact. When people saw a Fox News headline endorsing Joe Biden, it made them stop scrolling and think."" The strategic premise here rests on analyzing the Fox News audience, instead of stereotyping it. Yes, Fox News dominates among conservative viewers, but it also pulls in liberals and independents. Some of these folks, the Biden people have concluded, are persuadable. ""I can't blame somebody for not supporting my perspective if they literally have never heard it. It's my job to get that view in front of viewers who are tuning in in good faith,"" said former presidential candidate and current Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in November 2020. Why slam Fox News, in other words, when you can use Fox News?"
186,0,Soaring Skyward One More Time,669 words,The New York Times,"It is the latest lofty perch to become a drinking destination on par with the best street-level cocktail bars. The Panorama Room, at the top of the Graduate Roosevelt Island hotel on Roosevelt Island, opened in August. The same month, Overstory opened on the 64th floor of 70 Pine Street. (That bar is visible from Manhatta.) Mr. Meyer said the idea for the unusual reboot was born on Manhatta's last night of service in March 2020, when the bar was five deep with locals even as the pandemic loomed. His memory, he said, was ''of the best back bar in the city, because the back bar is the city.'' He added, ''It was exactly what we created the bar to be.'' Cameron Winkelman, who has worked at Mace, Dante and the Polynesian in New York, is the new head bartender. The bar area, which seats 100 and overlooks uptown, will be open seven days a week from 5 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. Mr. Winkelman brings a culinary approach to the cocktails, which are meant to evoke aspects of Gotham history. A section of the new menu is devoted to updated versions of drinks named after New York neighborhoods, both classic (the manhattan, Astoria and Brooklyn cocktails) and modern (the Red Hook and Little Italy cocktails). Look to the Cookie, an aquavit drink with coconut milk and a whole egg, mimics the flavor and appearance of a black-and-white cookie. Mr. Winkelman said he learned of the position from a Facebook post, and before taking the job, ''asked how weird would they be willing to get with the cocktails.'' Manhatta's restaurant will return, but not until later this spring, and under a different chef, still to be named. Jason Pfeifer previously ran the kitchen, which focused on French food. ''It was like 'Cats,' in that it never got a great review, but was packed every night,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''There was a deep affection for the restaurant.'' A bar-food menu, devised by a chef from the Union Square Hospitality Group, which runs the restaurant, includes oysters, a burger, fried chicken and a pretzel version of an everything bagel. Mr. Meyer is not new to the bar world. He opened the Manhattan bar Porchlight in 2015, followed by Cedric's at the Shed and Anchovy Social, a rooftop bar in Washington, D.C. The new Manhatta stays true to the vision Mr. Meyer had when it opened in the summer of 2018, that of a down-to-earth restaurant with an exceptional view. Mr. Meyer said he wanted to lead the reopening with the bar, which he considers the heart of Manhatta. ''If we've learned anything during this time,'' he said, ''it's the worth of doing things layer by layer.''

739,0,MEDIA PLAYER JOHN BURNS,677 words,The Sunday Times,"He grew up in Howth, the son of George Sevastopulo, a professor of geology in Trinity (who died last year), and of Rose, who ran a cake business from their home. The couple met when George, as a student at Cambridge, was on a field trip to Kerry and met Rose, from Limerick, in a B&B in Dingle. ""My dad had been helping in the kitchen,"" Demetri says. ""My mother came in and thought he worked there. She asked if he would take her bags up to the room. He did, and the rest was history."" After completing a business degree in Trinity in 1991, ""because I really had no idea what I wanted to do"", Demetri went to Japan to teach English. He had planned to stay a year and come back to study at King's Inns, but loved Japanese so much he sought out a job where he could use it. After a spell at Citibank and Bloomberg, he ended up at the FT, where he has covered south China and been the Pentagon/CIA correspondent, making contacts that now underpin his role reporting on US-China relations. This helped him to break one of the biggest stories in the world last year, revealing on October 16 that China had tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile that orbited the globe before zeroing in on its target. Five sources were cited. ""I got a tip and over three months managed to piece it together,"" Demetri says. ""It was tricky. Washington is probably the leakiest city on the planet ? it's easy to get information. But with a story like this there's a lot of classified information ? people who tell me things put themselves in legal jeopardy. You have to be very careful to protect sources."" The scoop was especially satisfying as there was initial scepticism ? ""some people were doubting it and saying it couldn't be true and China couldn't have made this progress"" ? before it was confirmed publicly by General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staf. ""f. ""That was a great couple of weeks,"" Demetri says. ""We got the story, beat the American newspapers, which is always hard to do, and then were vindicated in the end."" He got a similar scoop last month, revealing that Russia had asked China for military help in Ukraine. ""It went fairly viral, though not as viral as the hypersonic story. It was unbelievable how much traffic that got."" Which is how scoops are measured these days. The FT has more than one million digital subscribers, while its print sale is about 120,000. ""The way we operate now is 100 per cent digital,"" Demetri confirms. ""When we write stories we are thinking about the web, and a team in London picks the best stories at any given point of the day and puts them in the physical paper, but we really don't have much connection with that."" Despite the revolution in the industry, he heartily recommends it as a career. ""There's always going to be a future for journalism, and for resourceful, enterprising and resourceful people who want a job that's fun."" c We got the story, beat the American newspapers and were vindicated in the end"
680,0,"Pakistan's Samaa News TV show on PM's Russia visit, law against fake news",1031 words,BBC Monitoring South Asia,"Anchor Nadeem Malik opened the show, saying that Prime Minister Imran Khan is going to visit Russia. He mentioned that after the Afghan war, efforts have continued to rebuild relations with Russia. He recalled that in April 1999, the then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had visited Russia but in October 1999 his government had been toppled, so no progress could be made over the matters agreed during the visit. He mentioned that in 2015, a major development in relations with Russia took place when a gas pipeline agreement was signed but the agreement could not be implemented for several years and now under the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, efforts are being made to revive the pipeline agreement with minor changes. Malik remarked that ""the timing of the Prime Minister's visit to Russia is quite interesting"" because of the Ukraine situation, in which ""war clouds are hovering"" as the United States and Europe have taken a position and ""Russia has recognised the two Ukrainian regions under the control of the rebels"". He mentioned that in the present situation, where NATO is threatening Russia and Europe is warning about sanctions but Pakistan is not a big player like them and ""cannot take any major risk"". He reminded that the US and Europe are major trading partners of Pakistan. He said amid this situation, Pakistan would need a ""balancing act"" and the prime minister should make it clear during the visit that ""we are not part of any block and our only focus was on bilateral relations"". Amendment in cyber crime law Malik mentioned that the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists [PFUJ] has today [22 February] challenged the amendment in PECA [Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act] in the Islamabad High Court (IHC). He said a balancing act is needed in this regard as well to see what could be taken as fake news. He recalled that politicians have been involved in peddling fake news and cited the example of Prime Minister Khan's statements after the 2013 election, claiming that the election in 35 constituencies had been rigged and launched country-wide protests over the issue but later had backtracked and President Arif Alvi had apologised over the allegations. Malik also played a clip of Imran Khan blaming Brigadier Ranjha, a Military Intelligence official posted in Lahore during the 2013 election, for involvement in rigging that could not be verified later. Malik said now Prime Minister Khan and President Alvi have issued the ordinance to amend the PECA, which President Alvi had termed a crime in the past. He asked Usman Dar, Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Youth Affairs and a PTI politician, what was the objective of bringing the ordinance to make the law even more repressive. Dar remarked that PECA was a law that already existed and the government has just ""tried to improve its implementation"". He said everyone would agree that it was a ""free for all on social media"" and there was a need to control it. He remarked, ""There is a thin line between fake news and disinformation."" He said the opposition should not politicise the PECA ordinance because it was the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government that had passed the law in 2016. He claimed that the ordinance has been made to protect everyone from vicious campaigns. Speaking on the issue, Attaullah Tarar, a PML-N politician, said no law could be made in the country that is in conflict with the constitution of Pakistan and ""freedom of expression is the biggest right given in the constitution"". He also mentioned that ""laws are to be made after taking all the stakeholders, including civil society, intelligentsia, journalists and media houses, on board"" but ""this ordinance has been issued in a hurry"". He added that defamation laws are already present in Pakistan. He termed it a huge injustice that under cyber crime ""the non-cognisable and bailable offence has been made non-bailable and cognisable"". Malik contacted Hina Jilani, senior lawyer and a human rights activist, and asked her whether PECA law was needed in its present shape in Pakistan. Jilani remarked that laws like PECA are made with a ""mala fide intent"" and it should not have been made. She said the defamation law was already in place and defamation has been ""criminalised"" and ""over legislated"" by PECA. He said, ""We believe that defamation should be decriminalised."" She also remarked that fake news is wrong but that should be countered through statements. She said ""the civil society would not tolerate this kind of draconianism"" and has already challenged this law. No-confidence motion Malik referred to the statement of PML-N spokesperson Mariyam Aurangzeb that phone calls were coming to parliamentarians from Peshawar [a veiled reference to the military establishment] on the instruction of Prime Minister Imran Khan to pressure them regarding the no-confidence motion by the opposition. He asked Tarar that who were the parliamentarians being called from Peshawar or was it fake news. Tarar remarked that Aurangzeb issued this statement on behalf of the party and the statement is very clear. He said the parliamentarians with who we are in contact regarding the no-confidence motion were getting the phone calls but said that he would not disclose any details of the strategy and activities on the no-confidence motion. He claimed that a ""serious effort"" is underway to table this motion. Dar said the opposition is making big claims about bringing the no-confidence motion and challenged them to come up with a date to table the motion. He claimed that the opposition cannot remove the PTI government till the end of its five-year term. Source: Samaa TV, Karachi, in Urdu 1500 gmt 22 Feb 22"

42,0,Ticketless fans may struggle for hotels during Qatar World Cup,494 words,Al Jazeera English,"The Qatar 2022 World Cup organisers have launched an official accommodation portal for the tournament with ticket-holders as priority, meaning visitors arriving in Qatar without match tickets may not be able to secure a place to stay. Qatar is hoping to attract more than one million visitors during the World Cup that takes place from November 21 to December 18 this year. In the first round of ticket sales earlier this year, FIFA, footballâs world governing body, said it had received 17 million applications, the results of which were announced through a lucky draw. âFans can book accommodation via the dedicated portal which will offer various options such as apartments, villas and cruise ships,ï¿½?Omar al-Jaber, Executive Director of Accommodation at the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC), the tournament host organisers, said at the launch of the portal on Wednesday, confirming that prices would start from $80. âThe two cruise ships will have more than 4,000 rooms. There will be fan villages at four different locations. Accommodation options will also be available through vacation homes and visitors have the option of staying with friends and family.ï¿½?An SC official confirmed to Al Jazeera that organisers had block-booked 80 percent of the hotels and accommodation options across the country which will be available to ticket holders.

The organisers, in a statement sent to Al Jazeera earlier this year, said that âwith up to 130,000 rooms for the one million-plus fans expected over the course of the 28-day tournament, there are no concerns over a shortfall of accommodationï¿½? However, al-Jaber was unable to answer Al Jazeeraâs question on whether the SC was confident there would be enough accommodation for all those arriving in Qatar, instead pointing fans with valid tickets to visit the portal at the earliest to get the best prices and availability. An SC official later confirmed to Al Jazeera that âthe priority right now [for accommodation requests] are the ticket holdersï¿½? âWe anticipate a number of visiting fans will stay with friends or family during the tournament. Qatarâs compact tournament footprint will also mean teams and fans need only one accommodation for the duration of the tournament,ï¿½?according to the SC statement.

656,1,Miniature shoulder milling tools increase feed rates and productivity,603 words,ETMM Online,"The 04 size has a 3.5âmm cutting edge length that makes this new arrival compatible with tool body diameters as small as 8âmm. With the 04 inserts available for tool bodies from 8 to 25âmm diameter, the extremely small new Tung-Tri 04 insert has a 4âmm inscribed circle, yet it delivers the same benefits of light cutting and long tool life that existing Tung-Tri inserts have been providing for manufacturers., the company states. This enables the Tung-Tri 04 to generate up to double the tooth density when compared to alternate tools and subsequently increase feed rates. This compact configuration enables a 16âmm diameter Tung-Tri 04 cutter to offer four inserts per cutter whereas the 25âmm diameter cutter can facilitate six teeth. This insert density is common throughout the Tung-Tri series, ensuring that all tool body diameters and insert designations can offer maximum productivity levels and feed rates for end users. Complementing the new compact size 04 inserts are tool bodies for size 06, 10 and 15 inserts. The 06 inserts are suitable for 12 to 50âmm diameter tool bodies with 25 to 100âmm diameter for the size 10 inserts and 40 to 160âmm diameter bodies for the size 15 inserts. This range now ensures maximum productivity levels for components that demand high-speed cutting. The new Tung-Tri series uses three-edged inserts that are developed specifically to deliver precision, productivity and cost efficiency for shoulder milling applications. This allows users to choose an optimal tool setup according to the given part sizes and the required material removal volume. For the high-speed machining of components that are near-net-shape that require minimal machining such as additive manufactured parts and forged or cast components, the Tung-Tri is the ideal solution. The cutter also offers an impressive alternative to face mill cutters when face milling long reach areas. This is credit to its wiper edge geometries that create excellent surface finish, eliminating the need for secondary processes for high-quality surface finishes. As an economical shoulder milling series with an extensive line-up, Tung-Tri offers cost-efficient three-edged inserts that have helical cutting edges with large axial and radial rake angles. This design generates extremely low cutting forces making it suitable for lower powered machines, it also enhances precision when machining work to tight tolerances. The inserts are now available in three different chip former styles. This includes the general-purpose MJ geometry, the AJ geometry for non-ferrous applications and the NMJ with a serrated-edge chip splitter for efficient large volume material removal. The tool bodies are available in small-diameter cylindrical shanks, shell styles toolholders or as large-diameter porcupine cutters for roughing processes. This ensures the new Tung-Tri can be applied to a diverse range of machining applications. The insert cutting edge is designed with an innovative flank profile with multiple relief angles providing sharpness that generates low cutting forces and robustness that minimises the potential for insert fracture. In addition, the variable-pitch cutter body reduces chatter generation and creates a smooth cutting action.  The new Tungaloy Tung-Tri Series.  The new Tungaloy Tung-Tri Series."

(GATO) Investors and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm Before April 25, 2022",604 words,GlobeNewswire,"Gatos Silver focuses on the production and exploration of silver- and zinc-rich mineral deposits. Its primary efforts are the operation of the Los Gatos Joint Venture in Chihuahua, Mexico with Dowa Metals and Mining Co., Ltd. In addition to commercializing lead and zinc concentrates, the Company performs additional definition drilling to define and expand mineralization of the Cerro Los Gatos deposit (""CLG""). In October 2020, Gatos Silver conducted its IPO, selling approximately 21,430,000 shares of common stock at a price of $7.00 per share. On January 25, 2022, Gatos Silver revealed that ""there were errors in the technical report entitled 'Los Gatos Project, Chihuahua, Mexico' with an effective date of July 1, 2020 . . . , as well as indications that there is an overestimation in the existing resource model."" On a preliminary basis, the Company estimates a potential reduction of the metal content of its CLG's mineral reserve ranging from 30% to 50% of the metal content remaining after depletion. On this news, the price of Gatos Silver stock declined by $7.02 per share, or approximately 68.9%, from $10.19 per share to close at $3.17 per share on January 26, 2022. By February 22, 2022, when the lawsuit was filed, Gatos Silver shares were trading as low as $3.20 per share, a nearly 54% decline from the $7.00 per share IPO price. The lawsuit alleges throughout the Class Period, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that the technical report for Gatos Silver's primary mine, the CLG, contained certain errors; and (2) that, among other things, the mineral reserves had been overestimated by as much as 50%..

754,0,The government's anti-disinformation efforts should be consolidated,268 words,Washington Post.com,"The Internet Freedom and Operations Act of 2022 will direct new funds primarily to Internet censorship circumvention tools at the State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development and USAGM. Mismanagement of anti-censorship programs has also been the subject of investigation by the State Department inspector general. The Global Engagement Center (GEC) was created in the Obama administration for more than $40 million and was tasked with countering foreign disinformation. A similar disinformation venture exists at USAGM. The GEC remains largely opaque. It is long past time to combine all of these programs in a new organization that can be far more efficient and less embarrassing than USAGM has been. The editorial should prompt readers to do more checking on exactly what other federal government entities are doing and duplication of effort.

822,0,"US star Joe Rogan, podcaster in eye of misinformation storm",728 words,Agence France Presse,"But he also has many detractors, starting with luminaries Young and Mitchell, who removed their music from Spotify in protest at its hosting of Rogan's podcast. He has spread disinformation about the coronavirus and other topics on the air. Both musicians said the false claims, and Spotify's failure to do anything about them, was the reason for their decision. R&B singer India Arie followed suit, citing what she said were Rogan's ""problematic"" comments on race. For his accusers, he is particularly dangerous because his show ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" which has been broadcast exclusively on Spotify since 2020 under a deal worth an estimated $100 million, attracts a staggering 11 million listeners per episode on average. Often with a glass of whiskey in hand, he chats casually for two to three hours with a guest on topics as varied as flying saucers, psychedelic drugs, red meat and fitness, slipping in an expletive here and there. Rogan, with a tongue as sharp as his arms are tattooed, was already famous when he began the program in 2009. A comedian and martial arts commentator known for tight T-shirts and what critics have branded his ""toxic masculinity,"" in the 1990s he was a TV actor on sitcoms including NBC's ""NewsRadio."" Later he hosted the popular reality show ""Fear Factor."" When he launched the podcast, his ratings quickly took off. People from all walks of life asked to come on. In 12 years, he has hosted nearly 1,000 guests -- 88 percent of them male, according to the fan site JRELibrary. They include Tesla boss Elon Musk, who smoked a joint on his set, whistleblower Edward Snowden and film director Oliver Stone. But Rogan has also given voice to climate sceptics, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and, since the start of the pandemic, figures in the anti-vaccine movement, earning him the label of ""a veritable megaphone of right-wing lies"" by progressive website Media Matters for America. Posing as a critic of political correctness, he has attacked the left for demonising conservatives and flirted with unfounded theories held dear by former president Donald Trump's supporters -- notably about the presence of undercover FBI agents among the US Capitol attackers on January 6 2021. Like the former Republican president, he hates ""losers."" ""I grew up around a lot of losers and one of them was my dad,"" a former police officer who was violent and who left his family, Rogan said in an interview in 2016. ""There was a lot of desire to not be like that guy and not be like all of these people around me who had no hope and no future."" Yet he defends himself against accusations of being an ideologue or of voting exclusively on the right. An atheist who supports gay marriage, the decriminalization of soft drugs, and the preservation of gun rights, he calls himself a libertarian and said he even considered supporting self-described socialist Senator Bernie Sanders in the last Democratic primary. As for his guests, ""I'm interested in having interesting conversations with people that have differing opinions. I'm not interested in only talking to people that have one perspective,"" he said in a video posted on Instagram after Young's criticism that seemingly conflated misinformation with opinions. ""I'm not trying to promote misinformation,"" he continued. ""I will do my best to try to balance out these more controversial viewpoints with other people's perspectives."" He said he agreed with Spotify's announcement in response to Young and Mitchell that Covid podcasts would include links to factual and scientifically sourced information. In a perhaps telling comment for someone who was already famous before launching his podcast, he admitted he had not been ready for the ""strange"" responsibility of having ""this many viewers and listeners."" ""It's nothing that I prepared for, and it's nothing that I ever anticipated."" chp/vgr/st/mlm"

550,1,Three questions: iGUi - growth and international market,1044 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"We reached this dimension because of the expansion of the swimming pool market and the civil construction market. Brazil is in a very good moment in this area since 2018, after the construction sector had been at a standstill for many years. This phase had started in the late 2010s, when we had a very serious problem in the construction industry, which culminated in the arrest of the owners of the largest construction companies between 2015 and 2017. In addition, between 2010 and 2017, the construction industry had dropped by about 60%, and in some regions, the drop had been 70%. We suffered from this, but construction picked up because of the pandemic, which generated a very strong activation of the sector. This was reflected in the explosion of the values of all civil construction inputs, such as steel and cement. When the recovery came, it came in an unusual way. We were ahead of the competition and even of products that have a similar ticket. We had prepared ourselves, increasing our production capacity and buying inputs, which we did not lack at any time. This allowed us to deliver many goods during the pandemic, including in September and October 2020. The 70% jump we made between 2019 and 2021 is due to two factors: our preparation and the resumption of construction. Now, there is an important point: without quality, no company has a future. If you look, products such as clothing, shoes, automobiles, and houses are improving. Consumer goods and capital goods are evolving for the better. iGUi has always respected the principle that people want the best for themselves, and has always been one step ahead when it comes to quality. Evolution is in the DNA of the company, even before the growth of the last 3 years. How did the process of expansion abroad happen and how is the operation organized today? Our development abroad is somewhat eclectic. Franchise people are amazed that we are the most internationalized franchise in the country, and iGUi is a relatively new company compared to other brands, including much larger companies than ours, which have already tried to work abroad, got beaten up, and returned to Brazil. This is a very interesting thing. Brazilian companies that try to internationalize think that they have to adapt the product, that they have to set up a company to act abroad, that they have to do this, that they have to do that, that they have to, that they have to... But each one has its own formula. In the frying pan, the franchise that managed to have the largest operation abroad was iGUi. We have master franchisees in Argentina, Paraguay and Mexico. In Europe, we have a factory in Portugal that franchises forward, as well as resellers, distributors and stores that buy without being franchises. The iGUI metamorphoses according to the local partner. For example, we have a distributor in Australia, which is a very competitive market, the fourth largest in the world, despite having a population of only 25 million people. The Australian quality standard is very high. The best pool products are there. Our distributor has four points in major Australian cities and distributes to three dealers. He abandoned imports from China and Europe, and today is only with iGUi. This was a model that was happening. It is not a franchise or a master, but it works very well. We have a considerable participation in Australia with a totally different model. Detail: we do not have production in Australia due to the high cost of Australian labor. We send the pools there, and even with the increase of international transport due to the pandemic, they pay happily. We have locations that are serviced by a store that is not a franchise, not a master, and not a distributor. It buys our products and puts them on sale. We accept this, discuss the situation and offer alternatives. In this very eclectic and diverse way, things flow. We see what the subject wants, we talk, have a first experience and then we move on. He recognizes our quality and the favorable pricing conditions, and things end up evolving. We hardly ever start working with a retailer, a distributor, a master or a franchise and the movement stops. This is why business has been increasing. Our main difference in relation to other companies that try to develop abroad is malleability. Understanding the local partner and adapting ourselves to what he wants. How to make a product that is recognized abroad? Europe has already changed the concept of classic swimming pools because of iGUi's presence. We don't have the largest share of the European market, but in terms of concept and design, they have already bowed down to iGUi. They make fun of us, but they recognize it. We have two big swimming pool fairs in Europe: one in Lyon and the other in Barcelona. We have participated in these fairs for more than 20 years, showing launches and merchandise. People look, admire, and end up buying. In Belgium we have a very old client, of almost 20 years, who has stores in the country and partners in France. Not long ago, I was in Atlanta, USA, on a visit of the franchising staff, and I had the opportunity to see a Coca-Cola sales director explaining curious things that had happened to the American company in the international market, such as the exit of China and the entrance in other places. When you go abroad, you have to be very patient to wait for the return, which can be very long. Sometimes it is fast, but soon it stops too. If you have a hard head, nothing will come out, nothing will yield, nothing will go."

462,0,How a virus and draconian restrictions scuppered a cruise company,755 words,South China Morning Post,"The global cruise industry has been devastated by Covid-19 but, ultimately, Genting was sunk by draconian pandemic restrictions in its home port of Hong Kong, where it should have been marking the six-month anniversary of its inaugural ""cruises to nowhere"" on January 30. The wider economic impact on the city could be destructive, but some in the industry are trying to hold their nerve. ""It is still early to comment, as we await news of the restructuring ï¿½?it seems from their announcement that Dream Cruises will continue to operate, and indeed they are currently sailing in Singapore,"" says Jeff Bent, managing director of Worldwide Cruise Terminals, which operates Hong Kong's Kai Tak Cruise Terminal. Genting confirms it intends to keep parts of the business operating, including some cruises, but it is not possible to do so from its home port, with the Hong Kong government having halted all cruises on January 7 owing to rising Covid-19 case numbers. Now Genting's 150,000-tonne flagship, the Genting Dream, with its 36 food outlets, two spas, 999-seat theatre and two swimming pools, languishes at anchor in Hong Kong's outer harbour. Only five years ago, while dining aboard the Genting Dream with the ship's Swedish captain, Magnus Gottberg, the topic of conversation was the nascent Asian cruising boom. Star Cruises tapped into a lucrative market niche that the big players had missed. Cheap and cheerful offshore casino gambling proved popular with Chinese cruisers. By 2015, when the mainland was forecast to be the biggest market for cruise holidays by 2030, Genting was well poised to profit from the regional luxury cruising boom. Dream Cruises was founded and two new vessels ï¿½?Genting Dream (launched in 2016) and World Dream (launched in 2017 and the ship now operating in Singapore) ï¿½?were designed to deliver the highest level of service and opulence in the region. To capitalise on the growing demand for cruise ships, in 2016 Genting also set up MV Werften, comprising three existing German shipyards. The move loaded the business with a huge overhead and major financial commitment. Big ships take many years to build and it is rarely possible to change your mind if there is an unexpected downturn in business. Then Covid-19 struck. Global news was dominated by the drama aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship and footage of passengers being stretchered ashore from other liners to waiting ambulances. International cruising collapsed almost overnight. By September 2020, about six months after the shutdown of cruises worldwide, it was estimated the industry had suffered a loss of US$50 billion. Genting runs a tight corporate ship and went to extraordinary lengths to rebuild consumer confidence when cruises resumed. On Genting Dream, crew members had to be fully vaccinated 14 days before boarding; passengers also needed to be fully vaccinated 14 days before their departure date and pass a Covid-19 PCR test 48 hours before sailing. The ship's design allows external air to be filtered in, and air is not recirculated between cabins. Touchless handwashing stations and a PCR test machine with medical-laboratory-level capabilities were installed along with negative-pressure isolation wards. No cases of Covid-19 have been reported on Genting cruises operating from Hong Kong. It was possible Genting might have weathered the storm. On June 3, 2021, it announced MV Werften had received a loan commitment from Germany's Economic Stabilisation Fund to keep the shipyards afloat. And even with limited passenger capacity, two- and three-night themed cruises in Hong Kong waters generated much-needed cash. But then the loan fell through and, as Genting scrambled for time, it was sunk in its home port. Twelve days after cruises were banned, Genting filed for bankruptcy. ""The more relevant issue now is when and under what circumstances the government will allow cruising to resume, given that it continues in most of the rest of the world,"" Bent says."
796,0,Facebook an election risk: whistleblower,606 words,The Australian Financial Review,"""Because Facebook knows they operate in the dark - they don't have to tell the truth about anything - they continue to underinvest because they can get away with the bare minimum,"" Ms Haugen said. Ms Haugen's evidence came just hours after the share price of Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, tumbled as much as 24 per cent after the number of new users stalled and it forecast slower growth in advertising revenue. Ms Haugen shot to global attention last year when, as a former company insider, she leaked documents and gave damning testimony to a US congressional committee. She said the company knew the algorithms underpinning products on Facebook and Instagram were sowing misinformation and harming children, but executives had put ""astronomical profits"" ahead of safety. She was invited by the Morrison government to give evidence to its inquiry into the social media giants and the ""toxic material"" they allow to be published and distributed online. Ms Haugen, a data scientist, commended Australia for taking on big tech, including introducing the news bargaining code to support public interest journalism. But she urged the government to go further, as British and European officials have done, and attempt to regulate ""the heart of the business model of the platforms"" - the algorithms and design features that allow disinformation and hate to be spread and the exploitation of personal data. ""In every part of the world, what has become clear over the last few years is self-regulation does not work. Platforms cannot be trusted to act in the public interest,"" she said. ""Australia is due to have a federal election in only a few months. As we have seen in many recent elections around the world, particularly in the United States, threats to electoral integrity are unpredictable and can escalate rapidly. ""Australia with its unique geopolitical position is no exception. Social media is a major vector for co-ordinated disinformation campaigns. It adds fuel to the fire of confusion and fake news. It amplifies the most sensationalistic content to the detriment of balance and facts. China is a very, very sophisticated operator who has invested tremendously in weaponising social media platforms in open societies because they view our strengths as our weaknesses."" Ms Haugen said societies could no longer rely on platforms to moderate harmful and illegal content downstream given the sheer volume of material produced, and Facebook often ""blamed the victim"" when criticised. She said many things could be done to make platforms safer for children and reduce the spread of dangerous content and disinformation. She said social media companies should be made to do an assessment of the risks their products posed and make it public, while regulators, parents, doctors and others in the community should do likewise, so they could be held accountable. Academics should be given safe harbour to analyse Facebook's data, she said, noting the company had threatened to sue US academics and suspended their accounts after they tried to examine how Facebook advertisements manipulated US elections. One policy change that could be made was requiring the appointment of human moderators to approve the posting of content for groups that have more than 10,000 members."
563,1,Major expansion for top indieï¿½?377 words,The Harrogate Advertiser,"Paul Rawlinson, co-director of Baltzersenâs and Bakeri Baltzersen, said: âWe are proud to be a part of the Harrogate community and weâre excited to be expanding in terms of both production and delivery. âWe want to grow our range of products to offer a wider selection, work with more wholesale partners across Yorkshire as we fly the flag for our town, and create new jobs, training and career opportunities for local people.ï¿½?Bakeri Baltzersen was set up in March of 2019 as a sister brand to Baltzersenâs Scandi-cafe which launched in 2012 on Oxford Street in Harrogate town centre. Mr Rawlinson then took the decision in 2020 during the pandemic to open a purpose-built bakery at Kettlesing just outside Harrogate. Since then, Bakeri Baltzersen has been successfully supplying Baltzersenâs cafe and bakery shops, which also includes a retail outlet in Wetherby, alongside a growing number of wholesale partners across Yorkshire. The expansion will be part financed by a Â£27,390 grant provided by Harrogate Borough Council and a Â£20,000 grant from the Product and Process Innovation (PAPI) Fund - a legacy European funding programme. Alistair Forbes, SME Growth Manager for Harrogate Borough Council, said: âUsing Government funding awarded to all local authorities in recognition of the impact of Covid-19, the council has been able to support eligible businesses to recover from the impact, and to create new jobs across the Harrogate district. âBaltzersens was able to demonstrate adaptation and growth of the business with a clear expansion plan.ï¿½?Construction work is set to begin at the main bakery site this month and is expected to be completed in June. The expansion will generate a number of new employment opportunities, including trainee baker positions and roles for packers and drivers. The project will involve knocking through into the adjacent unit at Springfield Business Park and will effectively triple the bakeryâs floorspace.",
820,1,Volkswagen anticipates operating profit of 8.5 billion in the first quarter,459 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"In them, it anticipates a return on sales of 13.5% between January and March. The German automotive giant also pointed out that the development of the automotive business had positive effects of 3.5 billion. A large part of these valuation effects are attributable to raw material hedges and are not cash-effective, the Volkswagen Group stressed. In addition, the Automotive Division's net cash flow is around ï¿½?.5 billion, while the division's net liquidity amounts to around ï¿½?1 billion and includes the redemption of a hybrid bond for ï¿½?.1 billion in March 2022 and new hybrid bonds issued in the same month for ï¿½?.25 billion. On the other hand, the group has pointed out that the effects of the war in Ukraine ""cannot yet be predicted with sufficient certainty."" Given this situation, the consortium has acknowledged that there is still a risk that further developments in the Ukrainian war will have a negative impact on business activities, which may be due to bottlenecks in the supply chain. Also, negative effects may continue as a result of a worsening of the Covid-19 pandemic and the supply situation, especially for semiconductors. Electrical sales increase by 65% In the first quarter of the year, the Volkswagen Group delivered a total of 99,100 all-electric vehicles worldwide, an increase of 65% year-on-year. The largest increase was seen in China, where 28,800 customers took delivery of an electric model from the German group, 29% of the group's deliveries, more than quadrupling deliveries in the same period of the previous year. By region, Europe stands out with 58,400 deliveries of electric vehicles, accounting for 59% of the total number of electric vehicles marketed by the Group in the first quarter of the year. In the United States, the Group delivered 7,900 electric models, corresponding to 8 percent of its global deliveries. In the first three months of the year, the Volkswagen brand delivered 53,400 fully electric models, accounting for 54 percent of the total. It was followed by Audi with 24,200 vehicles, a share of 24 percent, Porsche with 9,500 vehicles (10 percent share), ?koda with 8,800 vehicles (9 percent share) and Seat/Cupra with 2,200 units (2 percent of the total)."

The deputy director added that Iran also imported 871,000 tons of various legumes, chicken, meat, eggs, tea and other goods worth $1.52 billion were imported to the country under the NIMA exchange rate during the reporting period. In total (both via the official exchange rate and the NIMA system exchange rate), Iran imported 30.9 million tons of essential goods worth about $19.6 billion within last Iranian year, which is an increase of 60 percent in value and 32 percent in volume, compared to the same preceding Iranian year. The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) has created a NIMA system in 2018 for exporters to sell a portion of their export earnings to banks to eliminate the shortage of foreign currency in the country for various reasons (sanctions, economic situation, etc.). In this system, exporters who earned more than 1 million euros from export a year must sell a portion of their export earnings to banks at the NIMA rate. Later, banks used to sell foreign currency to importers for the import of several products at this rate. The Central Bank of Iran has not imposed rules on exporters that earned from export less than 1 million euros a year. Those with total exports of one to three million euros per year are required to offer 50 percent of their received foreign exchange from the government through the NIMA system. The exporters with annual exports of three to 10 million euros are obliged to offer 70 percent. Those with exports of above 10 million euros per year must offer 90 percent of the received foreign exchange at NIMA. NIMA is a system intended for the sale of a certain percentage of the foreign currency gained from export. The price of 1 euro in this system is 268,558 rials, and the price of $1 is 246,132 rials."

826,0,Editorial: Musicians' Spotify protest has prompted disinformation change. More is needed.,548 words,St. Louis Post-Dispatch,"Spotify has responded by vowing to put up content warnings, and Rogan says he will start including mainstream expert voices in his interviews. Those raising free speech concerns are missing the broader point when they claim this is censorship: The musiciansï¿½?protest is free speech, and it has prompted the beginnings of change. Other musicians should step up. Roganâs worst offense against sound science has been turning Dr. Robert Malone into a superstar of the anti-vaccination movement. Malone promotes the myth that coronavirus vaccines are ineffective and dangerous. To promote this lie, he once publicized a video claiming the vaccine had killed a young high school athlete (in fact, the youth had died of unrelated causes years earlier). Malone also publicized a scientific study claiming to show vaccines are dangerous, without revealing the study had been retracted by its authors for factual errors. Maloneâs antics are especially problematic because he used to be a respected immunologist, which, to too many listeners out there, puts the veneer of scientific legitimacy on his disinformation. Why Malone has decided to go down this path is unclear, but the lies were severe enough to get him banned from Twitter late last year. Rogan subsequently conducted a now-infamous interview in which Malone compared pandemic restrictions to pre-World War II repression by the Nazis. To review: The coronavirus vaccines have now been administered to millions of people globally for more than a year, with close to zero reported instances of serious side effects. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calculates that vaccination (with boosters) is upwards of 90% effective at preventing omicron hospitalization; overwhelmed hospitals today are filled almost exclusively with the unvaccinated. These are facts, confirmed by the vast majority of the medical community. Whatâs coming from the naysayers arenât valid counter arguments but plain old disinformation. In announcing last week he was withdrawing his music from Spotify, Young noted that Roganâs listeners âbelieve Spotify would never present grossly unfactual information. They unfortunately are wrong.ï¿½?Thatâs an important point: Just by letting Roganâs show spew disinformation on its platform, Spotify lends it undeserved legitimacy. The solutions of putting up warning labels and presenting mainstream voices alongside the kooks are by no means perfect ï¿½?lies are lies, regardless of their context ï¿½?but itâs a step in the right direction. Now maybe more protests from more musicians can prompt a next step of getting disinformation off the platform completely."
910,0,Marjorie Taylor Greene is a wart on the body politic. Facebook is a melanoma.,857 words,Washington Post.com,"It was the tech equivalent of Dr. Evil holding the world ransom with a nuclear warhead for ï¿½?one million dollars in ""Austin Powers."" It allowed Greene (and Donald Trump and ""my Kevin"" McCarthy) to cry about censorship, yet it did nothing to stop the lies.  Facebook reasoned that ""removing her account for this violation is beyond the scope of our policies"" ï¿½?as if Facebook is utterly powerless to do anything to alter its own ridiculous policies. If the testimony and documents provided last year by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen weren't enough to show that Facebook's ""policies"" are destroying democracy, encouraging racist violence and ruining the mental health of a generation, a new investigation by a team from The Post and ProPublica leaves no doubt about Facebook's malignant impact and its dishonest corporate behavior: ""Facebook executives have played down the company's role in the Jan. 6 attack and have resisted calls, including from its own Oversight Board, for a comprehensive internal investigation. The company also has yet to turn over all the information requested by the congressional committee studying the Jan. 6 attack, though it says it is negotiating with the committee. ""But the ProPublica-Post investigation, which analyzed millions of posts between Election Day and Jan. 6 and drew on internal company documents and interviews with former employees, provides the clearest evidence yet that Facebook played a critical role in the spread of false narratives that fomented the violence of Jan. 6."" Specifically, there were more than 650,000 Facebook posts attacking the legitimacy of Joe Biden's victory ï¿½?more than 10,000 a day ï¿½?between Election Day and the Jan. 6 coup attempt. Facebook's attempts to temper the content ""were ineffective and started too late."" This failure to police itself by Facebook, and social media generally, is well-established pattern. ""Their years of dawdling and denying responsibility allowed hate to take root,"" Anti-Defamation League chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt writes in a book out this week, ""It Could Happen Here,"" about the dangerous spread of white supremacy. ""Their algorithms enabled this intolerance to expand and spread across the internet, entrancing users who often didn't even realize what they were encountering and feeding this content to those who affirmed their interest. And even now the industry's collective response remains spotty and insufficient."" Greenblatt recalled a July 2020 Zoom call with Mark Zuckerberg in which Zuckerberg bragged that Facebook's technology removed 88 percent of hate speech before users saw it. ""I was dumbstruck by his self-satisfaction,"" Greenblatt writes, likening it to Starbucks boasting that 88 percent of its drinks don't contain poison. The ADL chief calls for a ""drastic overhaul"" of Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which states: ""No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."" It was meant to promote the free flow of ideas online; in practice, it has promoted ""the free flow of filth."" It's long past time to cut off that flow. House Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) and others have introduced the Justice Against Malicious Algorithms Act, which would remove Section 230 protections for a social media company that recommended and promoted extremism, disinformation or other content that ""materially contributed to a physical or severe emotional injury."" Similarly, the Safe Tech Act, sponsored by Democratic Sens. Mark Warner (Va.), Mazie Hirono (Hawaii) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), would remove Section 230 protection for social media companies that fail to police cyberstalking, harassment and violations of civil rights by its users. The Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act by Democratic Reps. Tom Malinowski (N.J.) and Anna /G./ Eshoo (Calif.) would remove Section 230 protections for international terrorism and civil rights violations. Republicans haven't signed on to those bills, but there is bipartisan recognition of the problem. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has drafted a bill taking aim at Section 230 protections for the ""manipulative use of algorithms"" to promote political views. Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) have legislation that would strip Section 230 protection from tech companies in cases of child sexual exploitation. As this new year dawns, Democrats in Congress are rightly focusing on voting rights and other attempts to protect democracy.

An Amazon commissioned report has estimated that Amazon Web Services (AWS) has made a capital spend of ï¿½? billion on its network of data centres here over the past decade. The directors for ADSIL state that during the year, administrative expenses increased in line with expectations due to an increase in data centre operational expenses, partially offset by reduced headcount costs owing to the 2020 research and development activity transfer to another group undertaking. ADSIL ceased Research and Development activity on October 1st 2020 as this was transferred to a connected firm. The company last year recorded a post tax profit of ï¿½?1.48m after paying corporation tax of ï¿½?5.7m. The profit at ADSIL last year takes account of non-cash depreciation costs of ï¿½?.082 billion.

554,0,Keeping schools closed in view of COVID-19 not justified: World Bank education director,513 words,The Telegraph,"Saavendra also asserted that it does not make sense from a public policy perspective to wait till children are vaccinated before reopening schools as there is âno scienceï¿½?behind it. âThere is no relation between opening schools and the spread of Coronavirus. There is no evidence linking the two and there is no justification now to keep the schools closed,ï¿½?Saavedra said in an interview from Washington adding, âIt does not make sense to keep restaurants, bars and shopping malls open and keep schools closed. There is no excuse.ï¿½?According to various simulations by the World Bank, health risks for children if schools are opened are low and the cost of the closure is extremely high. âDuring 2020, we were navigating in a sea of ignorance. We just did not know what is the best way of combating the pandemic and the immediate reaction of most countries in the world was, letâs close schools,ï¿½?he said. âMany countries have also had waves when schools were closed, so obviously there has been no role of schools in some of the spikes,ï¿½?stressed Saavendra, adding that severe symptoms of infection in children were rarely reported. Talking about the impact of school closures owing to the pandemic in India, Saavedra said that the impact is more severe than previously thought and the learning poverty ï¿½?being unable to read and understand simple texts by the age of 10 years ï¿½?is likely to increase much more than anticipated. âThe learning poverty in India is expected to increase from 55% to 70% due to learning loss and more out-of-school children. In countries like India where the inequalities in education were already prevalent before the pandemic and the learning poverty levels were already gigantic, there is a lot at stake. Nearly two years later, schools remain closed for millions of children,ï¿½?he said. The potential increase of learning poverty might have a devastating impact on future productivity, earnings and well-being for this generation of children and youth, their families and the worldâs economies, added Saavendra. Rationalising the curriculum, reorganising the academic calendar, preparing the teachers for the huge task ahead are among the suggestions that the World Bank has made to reduce long-term learning losses caused by closure of schools during the pandemic. A 2020 report by the World Bank Education, titled âBeaten or Broken? Informality and COVID-19 in South Asiaï¿½? had predicted that the prolonged closure of schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India may cause a loss of over USD 400 billion in the countryâs future earnings."

405,0,"A Vermont Town Saves a Mountain, and Itself",1973 words,The New York Times,"Mr. Lyall beckoned me up an old chairlift ramp. He swept his ski pole across the panorama and pointed to the snow-covered summits of Okemo and Killington, ski resorts that lie within a 30-mile radius. The White Mountains of New Hampshire felt close enough to touch. ''There would be many times that I would stand up here and watch storms dump snow on those ski areas and just bypass Ascutney. We couldn't win,'' said Mr. Lyall, an avid backcountry skier. In its heyday, the Ascutney ski resort boasted 1,800 vertical feet of skiing on over 50 trails, and included a high-speed quad chairlift, three triple chairlifts and a double chairlift. But when it closed in 2010 because of scant snow and mismanagement (twin killers of small ski resorts), it threatened to take with it the nearby community of West Windsor, Vt., population 1,099. ''Property values plummeted, condos on the mountain saw their value decrease by more than half, and taxes went up,'' recalled Glenn Seward, who worked at the resort for 18 years, once as the director of mountain operations. The town's general store, the gathering place of the community, also went broke and closed. ''We were desperate,'' said Mr. Seward, who at the time was chair of the West Windsor Selectboard, a Vermont town's equivalent of a city council. That desperation led the community to hitch its fortune to the mountain, becoming a model for how a small ski area and its community can thrive in the era of climate change. Working with the state of Vermont as well as the nonprofit Trust for Public Land, the town bought the failed ski area in 2015. But instead of allowing a private company to run the mountain, contracting out its operations, the local residents themselves would chart a sustainable, volunteer-driven path for the ski area. Seven years later, Mount Ascutney and West Windsor are magnets for families and outdoor enthusiasts. Between 2010 and 2020, the town's population jumped over 20 percent and median single-family home sale prices more than doubled, to $329,750. A bustling new general store featuring local products has opened in the village of Brownsville, reinvigorating the center of the West Windsor community. The town and mountain draw people year round, from endurance runners and mountain bikers in the warm months to skiers in winter. At the heart of this revival is Ascutney Outdoors, a nonprofit with over 100 volunteers that now runs recreation on the mountain. Instead of high-speed quads and snow-making, skiers take a rope tow or T-bar that accesses 435-vertical feet of skiing, found on 10 natural-snow trails that are groomed. There is also a lift for snow tubing. A lift ticket costs $20, or $100 for a season pass. The lifts run on Saturday and Sunday when there is enough snow, and it takes about 40 volunteers to staff a busy weekend. The upper 1,300 vertical feet of the mountain, maintained by Ascutney Trails Association, is reserved for backcountry skiers to skin up and ski down for free -- though donations are appreciated. Thursday night ski races take place under lights, and an after-school program brings children to the mountain every afternoon. The mountain is also home to 45 miles of renowned mountain bike trails, numerous hiking trails and Mt. Ascutney State Park. It is one of the top hang-gliding sites in New England. ''When there's snow, we ski, and when there's not, we do other things,'' said Mr. Seward, who is now executive director of Ascutney Outdoors. ''That's a pretty easy model to sustain.'' ''We lost our identity as a ski town'' Mount Ascutney (elevation 3,144 feet), Vermont's most famous volcano, has lured skiers for decades. Skiing began on Ascutney in the winter of 1935-36 on the 5,400-foot long Mount Ascutney Trail, opened by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Windsor Outing Club. The first skiers skinned up the mountain under their own power, just like backcountry skiers today. The Mt. Ascutney ski area opened in 1946 with rope tows. In a harbinger of the struggles to come, the ski area endured several poor winters and went bankrupt four years after opening. New owners periodically came and went and Ascutney remade itself as a destination resort, attracting tourists and second-home owners from New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts. It was described in a 2005 New York Times article as ''less fashionable than some of its competitors'' with a base lodge that was ''small and utilitarian.'' Local skiers continued to be its loyal mainstay. Ascutney Resort was bedeviled by years of erratic snow levels. In the 1980s, a new ownership group, Summit Ventures, poured $55 million into lifts, condos and snow-making. A hotel was built at the foot of the mountain (it is now a Holiday Inn Club Vacations). By 1991, the ski area was forced into liquidation. The ski resort closed for the final time in 2010 and sold off its lifts. It was a crushing blow for the community. ''We lost our identity as a ski town,'' said Mr. Seward, who grew up in the community and married his wife, Shelley, on the mountain. Jim Lyall added: ''You saw everyone at the school, the general store, the post office, and at the ski area. We were in jeopardy of losing all four and becoming just a bedroom community.'' Skiing in a warming world Climate change poses an existential threat to New England ski areas, which now number 89 in six states. A 2019 study showed that in northeastern states besides Vermont, at least half of ski areas will close by the mid 2050s if high greenhouse gas emissions continue. A study published in 2021 in the journal Climate showed that New England is warming significantly faster than the rest of the planet. From 1900 to 2020, winter temperatures in Vermont rose 5.26 degrees Fahrenheit. ''That means more of our winter precipitation is falling as rain instead of snow, less of it is accumulating on the ground, and there is more midwinter melt,'' said Elizabeth Burakowski, research assistant professor at the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space at the University of New Hampshire. New England is littered with the ghosts of abandoned ski areas: According to the New England Lost Ski Areas Project, more than 600 ski areas have closed in the region. Ski industry leaders warn that the survival of ski areas depends on political action. ''It's absolutely critical that the business leaders in the outdoor and ski industries come together to strongly advocate for bipartisan climate action at the federal and state levels,'' said Adrienne Saia Isaac, director of marketing and communications for the National Ski Areas Association. West Windsor was determined to reimagine a future that did not rely on the vagaries of winter. In 2014, the West Windsor Selectboard asked the Trust for Public Land to help it purchase and conserve 469 acres of the former ski area to be used for backcountry skiing, mountain biking and other human-powered recreation. The ski area would be added to the existing town forest and protected by a 1,581-acre conservation easement safeguarding the land from development. A special town meeting was held in October 2014 asking West Windsor voters to approve the town spending $105,000 toward the $640,000 purchase of the former ski area, part of the $905,000 project price to return the land to recreational use. The purchase was approved by a three-to-one margin. In 2015, a group of townspeople gathered at Jim Lyall's house to start Ascutney Outdoors. A new rope tow was installed that same year, followed by the tubing lift in 2017 and a T-bar in 2020. The community raised funds to build the Ascutney Outdoor Center, a 3,000-square-foot base lodge, at the foot of the mountain. Reviving a community hub Brownsville Butcher and Pantry is minutes from Ascutney Outdoors, and their fates are tightly bound. Peter Varkonyi and Lauren Stevens opened the store in November 2018, and on a recent weekday, cheerily greeted a steady stream of customers and regulars. This is not your typical general store. It has a wall of Vermont craft beer and a butcher was carving a side of pork hung from a meat hook in front of refrigerator cases that include Vermont Wagyu beef, fresh goat and all the makings for sushi. In the cafe nearby, customers can choose from homemade bagels and housemade hot pastrami to a vegetarian smoked-beet Reuben and three varieties of burgers. In 2018, a community group, Friends of the Brownsville General Store, bought the foreclosed building from the bank for $95,000 and invested $250,000 to renovate it. The group then leased the building to Mr. Varkonyi and Ms. Stevens for $1 per year, with an option that the couple could purchase it at any time for cost. Chris Nesbitt, an organizer of the Friends group, urged his neighbors to ''think of this like the common good. You are investing in the community.'' Buying local ''is the basis to what we do every day,'' said Ms. Stevens, proudly itemizing $35,000 in purchases of organic produce from Edgewater Farm in Plainfield, N.H., and $30,000 in lamb, goat and pork from Yates Farm just down the road. In 2021, she tallied, ''our tiny business put $500,000 back into local businesses.'' In December, the couple bought the store from the Friends. A lifelong resident of the community and teacher at the local elementary school, Amanda Yates, was sitting with her young son enjoying burger night at the general store. Ms. Yates motioned to the bustling cafe and store. ''I credit the store and Ascutney Outdoors with bringing the town back,'' she said. ''They brought places where you could meet, get good food, where you could see people again around town. ''They really brought back that community hub.''

417,0,How a man who washed his own underwear built investment colossus GIC,2378 words,AFR Online,"At the time, Goh was trying to attract investment talent to come and work at Singapore's just launched sovereign wealth fund GIC, more formally known as the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation. In a book documenting the history of GIC, economist Freddy Orchard says the decision to establish the fund was audacious. ""Forty years ago, only oil-rich countries had anything resembling a sovereign wealth fund and all that Singapore had by the way of oil (then and now) was the uncertain sweat of its brow."" GIC is an investment colossus. It does not reveal the extent of funds under management. Estimates vary between $US550 billion ($773 billion) and $US744 billion. By all counts, it is among the top 10 sovereign wealth funds worldwide. It's also set to move up a couple of rungs after the Singapore government last month passed legislation expected to see the transfer of up to $S185 billion ($192 billion) from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to GIC. The fund is a force to be reckoned with in the more than 40 countries where it holds investments. After a big year in 2021, it has emerged as the biggest source of foreign funds in commercial property in Australia and the largest state-owned investor in the country. It has a stake in Sydney's Chifley Tower and Melbourne's Emporium. Recently, its focus has shifted to the new heart of retail - the outsized distribution and logistics centres that enable e-commerce. Its remit, drummed into every GICian (as those who work there are known), is to look ahead and take a punt on what will pay off in the future. Its chosen performance metric is a 20-year rolling real rate of return. Last week, it invested in Hong-Kong based InterContinental Energy[https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/singapore-backs-wa-green-hydrogen-mega-projects-20220127-p59rk7], a hydrogen play with projects in Western Australia. Assuming this is approved by the Foreign Investment Review Board, that one deal will add an estimated $US3 billion to GIC's investments in Australia, according to the New York-based sovereign investor specialist Global SWF. Recently, GIC has also allowed itself the luxury of looking back, marking its 40th anniversary last year with an updated edition of Orchard's book, Bold Vision: The Untold Story of Singapore's Reserves and Its Sovereign Wealth Fund. The added prologue details what happens to a rainy day fund when a storm arrives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Singapore government has drawn on its global reserves more extensively than ever before. In the last two years, it has announced budget assistance packages of more than $S100 billion and the expected draw on reserves over that period will be $S53.7 billion, 10 times the amount tapped during the global financial crisis. Singapore's reserves have helped it preserve its status as a net creditor country, essential for a trading and financial hub. That's held through times of emergency. The government, which is constitutionally bound to balance spending with revenue, has come to rely on investment returns of an estimated S$19.6 billion a year. These returns are generated by GIC, its sister state-owned investor Temasek, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which are the largest contributors to the budget. This reliance will only increase as Singapore confronts the spending needs of an ageing population. Bumps along the way Of course, in 40 years of investing, there have been some duds. GIC was among those burnt when China's state-owned Guangdong International Trust & Investment Corp failed in the late 1990s. More recently, GIC was an early fan of Ant Financial, the fintech spun off by Alibaba that was valued at $US315 billion before its planned initial public offering was scuppered in November 2020. Before Chinese regulators pulled the plug on the $US34 billion IPO, Singapore's Business Times reported that GIC planned to invest more than $US1 billion. GIC declined to comment on those plans, which is par for the course. The operation remains largely a mystery with the flow of information tightly controlled. It does not, for example, publish single-year returns, presenting only the 20-year figure in its brief annual report. This is part of the attraction of Orchard's book Bold Vision: it takes us inside. When the newly appointed managing director of GIC arrived at work on his first day, he found a desk but no chair, and a telephone that didn't work. GIC now has 1800 employees in 10 offices worldwide and will open its 11th in Sydney this year. Rabbit and the snake As is the case with most aspects of Singapore's swift evolution to developed country status since independence in 1965, the shadow of the nation's founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew looms large over the GIC creation story. Bold Vision cites the interview Lee had with a team from Rothschild Bank that had flown to Singapore with hopes of being chosen to consult on the then new GIC. One of the Rothschild crew, Kate Mortimer, reportedly told a friend she felt like a ""rabbit transfixed by a snake"" during the meeting with Lee. Another, Richard Katz said he was unprepared for the ""very direct, very testing questions and the sheer incisiveness and ferocious intelligence"" of the prime minister. The book details how Lee was initially reluctant to take on the role of chairman of the nascent GIC but was persuaded by Goh, the architect of the young nation's monetary policy who went on to become the driving force behind GIC. In a letter to Goh on December 28, 1984, Lee wrote: ""No panegyric can do justice to you. A whole generation of Singaporeans take their present standard of living for granted because you had laid the foundations of the economy of modern Singapore."" It was Goh who decided not to follow other central banks when they ruled interest rates were the most effective lever for controlling inflation. Instead, citing Singapore's extensive trade and capital flows, Goh judged it more effective to target the exchange rate. This is still the practice in Singapore. It was also Goh who nursed the then radical idea that the nation's reserves could - and should - be invested to yield returns, a notion that eventually led to the formation of GIC. The first section of the book deals with events in the late 1960s that demonstrated the importance the newly independent nation attached to controlling its reserves. A dispute between Malaysia and Singapore on this subject ultimately prompted Singapore to change its mind about sticking with a joint currency and instead issue its own, a move that made reserves management a priority. Monetary separation ""Dr Goh had been the first among his colleagues to see in 1965 that Singapore's political separation from Malaysia was inevitable,"" writes Orchard. ""A year later, he seemed to have been the first to conclude that a monetary separation was inevitable too."" Excerpts of letters from both sides reveal not just the facts but also the tenor of those discussions. Similarly, the reproduction of typed - of course - correspondence between British and Singapore officials brings a human dimension to the drawn-out demise of the ""sterling area"", a time when the currencies of Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and other former colonies were pegged to the British pound. ""My dear Finance Minister"", wrote Roy Jenkins, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, to Goh on December 6, 1967. ""I am writing now about your own reserve position ... I am concerned at this news and I want to consult with you about it."" Bold Vision takes the reader through the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and Nixon's abrupt suspension of the guaranteed convertibility of US dollars to gold. These and other events are all presented from the viewpoint of a young nation that knew its future depended on having a currency that other nations trusted. Safeguarding its reserves, particularly amid the global financial turmoil of the 1960s and 1970s, was a necessity. ""The country had to have a strong and stable currency. That was the precondition of its existence as a financial and commercial centre,"" Orchard writes. Occasionally, this meant ignoring well-meaning advice. That happened in 1967, when the IMF recommended the adoption of a central bank system. Singapore listened politely and then did what it wanted to, which was establish a currency board instead. This was broadly how Britain had secured the value of currencies in its colonies, by ensuring they were all backed by reserves in London. Singapore decided to keep the model to ensure everybody knew that every one of its dollars was backed by the equivalent in reserves. (Singapore still operates on currency board principles, even though the Monetary Authority of Singapore has assumed these functions). Golden opportunity As the sterling area unravelled, Goh ordered the reserves be spread across various currencies (much to London's chagrin, at least to start). This is now accepted wisdom but at the time was unusual. In September 1968, the same priority prompted Goh to buy gold, This was not a simple matter at the time. As Orchard notes, ""given the US-led embargo on gold ... the purchases would have to be covertly made"". So Goh and his colleague Ngiam Tong Dow met South Africa's then minister for finance Dr Nicholas Diederichs in a Washington hotel room. Diederichs had the television turned up to prevent anyone from listening in and the two agreed that Singapore would buy 100 tonnes of gold at an indicative price of $US40 per ounce and to meet next in Zurich. ""Dr Diederichs then fished out a US dollar note and tore it and gave half to Ngiam. The other half, he told his Singaporean visitors, would be held by his representative at the Zurich meeting ... Dr Diederichs would probably have torn the note with a practised hand: a number of countries including European ones, were known to have broken the US-led embargo by buying gold from South Africa."" âChronic surplus' Goh's division of economies into two main types - those that generated surpluses and those that generated deficits - was key to his thinking that Singapore should invest at least some of its reserves to maximise returns, a shift away from the traditional approach to keeping reserves in cash and easy to liquidate, short-term holdings. Goh's problem with this was the subsequent returns were eroded by inflation. Singapore, he believed was likely to be an economy that lived within its means. Indeed, he sometimes used the term ""chronic surplus"" to describe a country where the national savings rate generally ranges between 35 per cent and 40 per cent of GDP. So, he reasoned, the country's reserves could serve a dual purpose - one pot, or portfolio, to manage the exchange rate and back the Singapore dollar and another second portion that could be invested for capital appreciation. Bold Vision traces the evolution of the idea, radical in the 1970s, that reserves could be invested in equities. This was a period of rapid growth for Singapore, when the economy expanded on average at 9 per cent a year. Government revenue grew and budget surpluses of 3 per cent to 4 per cent of GDP were the norm. This, paired with a high savings rate and capital inflows, delivered payment surpluses and built up reserves. It became clear that central banking and investment management were not a natural mix. MAS was a leader in equities but those investment decisions were made by the same employees who made fixed-income decisions as well. Goh concluded that surplus reserves should be taken off the balance sheet of the central bank so they could be better invested for long-term returns. GIC became the vehicle to do this. From the beginning, the GIC board emphasised three things: it had to conduct itself in a manner beyond reproach; be focused on long-term returns, not short-term gains; and finally, ensure Singapore remained in control of how its reserves were managed. External fund managers were not an option. And how long is long-term? Lee said quarterly results mattered little to him - ""even annual returns need not be concerning unless GIC was acting stupidly"". This does not appear to have happened very often. Global SWF describes GIC as ""one of, if not the world's most sophisticated investor, priding itself on hiring always the smartest people in the room, and putting a lot of thought behind its strategic asset allocation, its investment decisions and the general direction of the fund."" In the forward to the new edition of Bold Vision, Singapore's Senior Minister and GIC deputy chairman Tharman Shanmugaratnam writes that although GIC was founded only 40 years ago, it is part of the larger approach of public finances that Singapore has adopted since independence. ""Thinking long-term is at the core of the philosophy; thinking not just one year or one term of government at a time, or even one generation at a time, but about the interests of both current and future generations."" At the Bold Vision launch in October, GIC chief executive Lim Chow Kiat described the book as ""a snippet of the âSingapore Story', the progress of a small island state since independence, and how it has been underwritten by the investment returns from the diligent management of the country's reserves"". Lim is now helping to take the story forward. In 2020, GIC began a process to imagine what the investment landscape would look like in 2035. This 15-year time frame will, he said in an interview that is included in the updated Bold Vision, ""give our people freedom to be more radical, more courageous as they will not be constrained by the here and now""."

383,0,Can China's Starbucks win back investors?,2694 words,Financial Times,"By Eleanor Olcott and Tabby Kinder I n less than five years of existence, Luckin Coffee has been variously a symbol of the dynamism of Chinese capitalism, the subject of a massive fraud scandal and now its new senior executives insist a plucky comeback story that has the potential to test US-China relations. Founded in 2017, the chain of coffee shops spread quickly across China, creating a homegrown challenger to Starbucks. Just two years later, Luckin floated on Nasdaq with a market value that reached $13bn as investors were seduced by the prospect of booming Chinese consumer demand. But the company unravelled in 2020 after it was revealed to have defrauded investors by faking more than $300mn of sales. Luckin was delisted by Nasdaq and forced to pay $180mn to settle charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The scandal stung investors such as BlackRock and GIC and provided the latest illustration of the failure of Big Four auditors to spot holes in company accounts Luckin had been audited by EY. Most of all, it became a trigger for a political controversy over the presence of Chinese companies on US capital markets. The scandal was seized upon by some US senators as a prime example of how Chinese corporates could not be trusted, part of a broader push by some in Washington to decouple the US financial system from China. But two years later, Luckin is hoping that investors, regulators and even politicians have forgotten the entire episode. The Chinese coffee chain is staging an audacious comeback that involves trying to raise new capital, meeting with investors and plotting with advisers to relist its shares in the US, according to people familiar with the matter. The company declined to comment on its proposed relisting plans, but one senior executive said it was now ""in a position where we're more comfortable re-engaging with public investors"" and that it wanted to ""regain credibility"". Luckin says it has turned a new page. ""Almost everything about Luckin apart from the name has changed over the past two years,"" says Guo Jinyi, who took over as chief executive officer in July 2020, two months after it was delisted. ""The business approach, the operation, the team, the company culture which was responsible for the financial problems have all changed."" Since the company was delisted, Luckin claims to have been on a tear in China. Revenues have more than doubled to $364.7mn year on year in the latest quarterly earnings report. Luckin now has more than 6,000 stores across China, about 500 more than Starbucks. The rapid growth story that global investors initially bought into when the company started trading in the US in 2019 appears to have been borne out. Chinese consumers have flocked to Luckin in search of cheap hits of caffeine. ""Luckin is truly a national enterprise. It goes abroad to rip off others' money and then gives coffee vouchers to people in China,"" says Wang Ning, a 29-year-old wealth manager in Beijing and regular Luckin customer. That growth is once again attracting the interest of investors. More than $20mn of its shares change hands in over-the-counter transactions every day and the company's market value has climbed back up to more than $3bn, after its shares lost 90 per cent of their value in 2020. The question is ""whether the fraud was hiding a permanently flawed business or if it was lying on top of something legitimate that had long-term viability"", says John Zolidis, president of the New York-based equity research firm Quo Vadis Capital. Zolidis says Luckin's shares are ""attractively valued given the overhang of fraud"". Luckin's attempt to relist is a big test of the efforts by some politicians in Washington to limit the presence of Chinese companies on US markets. Will the political, regulatory and legal obstacles that Chinese companies face frustrate Luckin's plans, or will they be overcome by the lure to investors of one of the world's most appealing consumer growth stories? ""Everyone expected it to sink but it instead appears to be a phoenix rising from the flames,"" says a veteran analyst of Chinese companies in Hong Kong. ""If it were to relist it would cause all sorts of political ramifications. To a degree, it would look like a political act as much as [having] accounting or investor-related repercussions."" Luckin Coffee was founded in the south-east coastal city of Xiamen by a serial entrepreneur, Charles Lu. The former chair of the coffee chain, whose name means ""lucky"" in Mandarin, expanded the company's network of stores in China at a breakneck speed. Lu brought on Qian Zhiya, a colleague from a car rental company that had experienced similarly explosive growth in its early years, to serve as Luckin's CEO. On the eve of Luckin's stock market debut in 2019, Forbes estimated that Lu's net worth was $2.3bn. 'Fundamentally broken' At the root of the Luckin fraud was its aggressive expansion strategies, favoured by Lu, of grabbing market share for new customers with heavily discounted beverages and then inflating the net selling price to hide the fact it was selling at a loss. ""The company was burning through money,"" says one Luckin insider of the period leading up to the IPO and follow-on offering. This was highlighted in a damning 89- page report first published by American short selling firm Muddy Waters in January 2020, which accused it of inflating sales, poor corporate governance and being a ""fundamentally broken"" business. An undercover research firm dispatched more than 1,000 researchers to Luckin Coffee stores to monitor customer traffic and coffee sales and found discrepancies with their reported figures. Lu and Qian, who have both since left the company, did not respond to requests for comment. Lu conceded on his public WeChat account in May 2020 that his ""style may have been too aggressive"" but added ""it was never my intention to deceive investors."" Two years on, Luckin says things have changed. A senior executive says its internal controls have been improved by hiring personnel from the Big Four accounting firms to conduct internal checks and report directly to the audit committee, which corporate governance experts say is a crucial step for any company that is planning to attract new international investors. At the centre of the coffee chain's turnround has been David Li, whose $2bn private equity fund, Centurium Capital, was one of Luckin's earliest and biggest financial backers. Centurium sold $232mn worth of shares just before the scandal but has since bought several larger stakes in Luckin at a much lower price. Last month, it became the company's controlling shareholder after it acquired shares that were previously held by Luckin's co-founders. Li has been ""cleaning up the company, getting rid of the bad guys"", says a person close to him. He ""had a team camped out at the company for months, working out a turnround strategy"". Luckin used the cash injection from Centurium to pay for shareholder litigation and repay some of the debts due on bonds and overseas restructuring costs. The company is now on the brink of ending bankruptcy proceedings in the US, a crucial step in its path to relist. As a result of the bankruptcy process, the hedge funds that bought about $420mn of its convertible bonds in January 2020 will receive about 96 cents on the dollar. ""After only one-and-a-half years, they have got almost all their money back, plus some new bonds, cash and stock,"" says an external adviser involved in the restructuring process. ""If you break it down, it is a genuinely unprecedented situation,"" says the person. ""I've never seen another case where you have such a high return for creditors, settlement of legal and regulatory matters and improving operating performance all in the same short period of 18 months."" Li and Guo's turnround strategy includes closing down underperforming stores and increasing the price of a cup of coffee by 60 per cent to an average of $2.50 still half the price of an equivalent Starbucks coffee. Luckin claims it has reduced property and staffing costs through the use of an ""in-app"" purchase system and has started using franchisees to expand the number of its stores rather than owning them all outright. It has also had success with new beverages, including a coconut velvet latte that sold out over the summer. Xu Xueqiong, 36, owner of a small business in Anqing, a city in Anhui province, is an avid fan of the drink. She says Luckin's branding, use of coupons and sweeter flavours ""suit Chinese people's consumption habits"". Michael Norris, a senior research analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina, says that Guo's gamble to start using franchisee partners to share the risk of opening new stores, especially in lower-tier cities, has paid off. Revenue from those stores has tripled in the last quarter compared with the same period the previous year. But analysts have warned that Chinese consumer habits are fickle, and Luckin is increasingly fighting competition from domestic rivals with substantial financial backing, including a new, trendier competitor, Manner Coffee. Norris adds that investors may be sceptical at reports of accelerating growth: ""Revenues rising sharply is something that those of us who have been following Luckin have seen before."" It reported a net loss of $859mn for the 2020 financial year. In the first nine months of 2021, Luckin's net losses were $3.6mn, according to its financial statements. Carson Block, founder and head of Muddy Waters, says he is ""surprised"" at Luckin's turnround: ""In the old days, companies were finished once confirmed that they were frauds ... But Luckin seems to be saying the fraud is water under the bridge. That now they've raised the money on the back of lies, they're putting it to use and becoming real,"" adds Block. Winning back trust Far harder than inventing coconut lattes will be the job of convincing foreign investors and regulators that its finances can be trusted. Luckin is setting out plans to relist at a time when tensions between the US and China over the quality of Chinese companies listed in US markets is at an all-time low. The most recent case was the disastrous listing of Didi, a ride-hail- ing app, last June, when regulatory blocks by Beijing days after its flotation meant its shares crashed by 80 per cent and investors lost billions. Since then, new flotations by Chinese companies in the US have been in effect paralysed. Both Washington and Beijing are wary of continuing to permit the deepening of financial links between Wall Street and corporate China. To relist on the Nasdaq centralised exchange Luckin needs to first formally exit bankruptcy proceedings, which according to an individual involved in the process should happen in the next few weeks. Luckin will then apply to rejoin Nasdaq's centralised exchange. The exchange can deny a company's listing if it believes investors might be at risk, but in general, it is required to accept those companies that meet the exchange's requirements. The SEC and Nasdaq refused to comment on Luckin's relisting plans. The company will also need to navigate new laws that have come into place in the wake of its 2020 scandal which make the US a far less hospitable environment for Chinese companies going public. The US Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which was passed in late 2020, puts pressure on Chinese companies to make audit papers available for inspection. It could force about 240 Chinese companies worth a combined $2tn to delist from US exchanges over the next few years. ""There is no indication that either the US or China will budge on this issue,"" says Jay Ritter, an IPO expert at the University of Florida. Under this law, the US authorities could delist companies that fail to submit to US regulatory checks on their audits for three years in a row. This has resulted in a stalemate for companies and their accountants as Beijing does not permit foreign oversight of Chinese companies' financial records. As a result, even if it successfully relists, Luckin could be delisted again by US regulators in the future purely because of a lack of access to its audit files. ""If Luckin relists and is trading, what's the price discount for the fact that if you buy the shares you don't know if or where you're going to be able to sell them in two or three years' time?"" says one accounting expert. Crucial to Luckin's comeback will be investors' confidence that its books are credible, especially given the failures of original auditors EY to identify duplicity, and perhaps also the fact that the CFO at the time of the scandal, Reinout Schakel, is still in place. Since the fraud was exposed, Luckin has had two new audit firms. The group appointed Hong Kong accounting firm Centurion ZD CPA as its auditor in April 2021 after its predecessor, New York-based Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk, was replaced. As US regulators and exchanges put greater focus on the quality of Chinese company audits, the work of a smaller firm is likely to receive more scrutiny. Centurion, which says it has about 40 accountants in Hong Kong and the US, is registered with the US audit regulator, allowing it to sign off the accounts of Chinese companies listed in America. But so far it audits just a small number of such companies traded on Nasdaq or over the counter. Centurion did not respond to a request for comment. In its audit of Luckin's 2020 accounts, the most recent full-year audited financial statements, Centurion identified as a ""material weakness"" that Luckin lacked ""entity level control policies and procedures, including failure to demonstrate commitment to integrity and ethical values"". It also said Luckin lacked appropriate separation of duties, including around making investment decisions and use of funds. Even so, some investors may be tempted back into its equity because of Luckin's growth prospects. ""By market capitalisation per store, it is a cheap and attractive asset,"" says a fund manager who has traded Luckin's over-the-counter shares. Yet so far, it is primarily China-focused hedge funds and mainland capital that have flooded back into Luckin shares. ""It's hard to see someone like Fidelity getting back into it on day one,"" the fund manager adds. Winning back the support of large international investors would be critical for Luckin's comeback story. ""I suspect there is work to be done for redemption before that,"" says Kerrie Waring, chief executive of the International Corporate Governance Network, a lobby group for institutional investors.

The weighted average price per share is calculated as 94,700 won, and the corporate value after the pre-IPO is estimated to be 4 trillion won. Four Korean financial investors participated in the pre-IPO funding -- Premier Partners LLC will invest 280 billion won, Ium Private Equity and the consortium of Brain Asset Management Co. and NH Investment & Securities Co. each will inject 200 billion won, and Find Value Asset Management will put 120 billion won. Find Value is understood to sell part of the 120 billion won project fund to retail investors and look for securities firms for the sales. The private fund will allow individualsï¿½?participation with a 300 million won or higher commitment per person. Deep-pocketed investors are hopeful for more than double their return after the IPO in the second half of 2023.

611,0,Garrett Harker of Eastern Standard fame coming back to the Fenway with four new restaurants,989 words,The Boston Globe,"Harker has reached a deal to open four restaurants in the Bower apartment building in the Fenway Center development, a luxury mixed-use project on Beacon Street, just a five-minute stroll from his old stomping grounds at the Hotel Commonwealth. The restaurants will open early next year. Harker plans to carve up 20,000 square feet in the Bower's street-level retail space and make full use of the center's plaza, where he'll have a sea of outdoor seating. The two-building apartment complex, which opened in 2020, is the first phase of the long-planned Fenway Center project; phase two ï¿½?which includes a 22-story office tower to be built on a deck atop the Massachusetts Turnpike ï¿½?launched last year. Now the project will have a big-name restaurant anchoring its ground floor just outside Kenmore Square. âWhile there have been dark clouds in our industry for the past two years, I'm as excited as ever to roll up my sleeves and dig in,ï¿½?Harker said in a statement. âI'm grateful to the team at Bower for giving me the opportunity to once again be a part of creating an entirely new neighborhood just a short five-minute walk from my home of 15 years.ï¿½?Harker has long played an outsized role in Boston's hospitality industry. After opening the award-winning No. 9 Park with chef Barbara Lynch, he went on to build B&G Oysters and The Butcher Shop in the South End. He struck out on his own with Eastern Standard in the Hotel Commonwealth in 2005, creating a brasserie whose long marble bar became a base of a different sort for the entire Fenway neighborhood. Known for welcoming a cross-section of the city, it was once called âa perfect restaurantï¿½?by Globe food critic Devra First. In 2010, Harker partnered with Jeremy Sewall, Shore Gregory, and Skip Bennett of Duxbury's Island Creek Oysters to open Island Creek Oyster Bar, and followed that with The Hawthorne cocktail bar in 2011. Over his 15-year tenure, Harker was often credited with kickstarting the transformation of Kenmore Square, establishing the corner of the city as a dining destination that was so closely associated with him that many dubbed it âHarkertown.ï¿½?The group went on to open several more celebrated restaurants: Row 34 in both Fort Point and Portsmouth, N.H., and a second Island Creek Oyster Bar in Burlington. (Their Harvard Square foray into French food, Les Sablons, closed in 2018 after just a year in business.) Harker also continued with his own projects, opening Branch Line rotisserie in Watertown and launching Eastern Standard Provisions, an artisanal pretzel and snack company, in 2019. Like many restaurants, the trio in the Hotel Commonwealth shut down service at the outset of the pandemic. But they never reopened, in part because of a protracted legal battle between Harker and the restaurants' landlord, Urban Meritage, which ultimately led Harker and his partners to shut down entirely early last year. While the city's restaurant industry has seen an unprecedented number of closures as a result of the pandemic, the fall of some of the biggest hospitality darlings hit hard. Heartbroken diners lamented the fact that they were never able to sample the french fries or roasted bone marrow one last time. And shortly after the news broke about the closure, the partners announced they were parting ways too, with Bennett focusing on Island Creek Oysters and Sewall and Gregory taking over ownership of the Row 34 restaurants and the remaining Island Creek Oyster Bar in Burlington, which they've since reopened as a Row 34. It was all dark, depressing stuff. But now, finally, there are some bright spots. In November, Bennett opened The Windsor House, a new restaurant in Duxbury across the street from the Island Creek Oyster Farm. And last week, Sewall and Gregory announced that a new Row 34 will open this fall in Kendall Square. And as for Harker, the big looming question was not just if he could stage a return, but when and where. Harker had a noncompete agreement with Urban Meritage that said he could not open a new restaurant within 2 miles of the hotel for two years after the restaurants closed. But given the booming new development underway in and around Kenmore Square, there was no shortage of suitors willing to work with him. And ultimately, developer John Rosenthal, whose Meredith Management built the Bower in partnership with the Green Cities Company and Nuveen Real Estate, wooed Harker to the Bower. âWe can't wait to bring Garrett back home to the Kenmore Square/Fenway neighborhood and Greater Boston,ï¿½?Rosenthal said. âGarrett has been sorely missed by our neighbors, and frankly, Boston's entire restaurant scene. He is the perfect hospitality partner for this remarkable new destination.ï¿½?Harker is being mum on what the makeup of the four restaurants will be, but there are clues: Mixologist Jackson Cannon, his longtime business partner who helmed The Hawthorne bar, will be overseeing the beverages. And chef Nemo Bolin, who served as executive chef at Eastern Standard until it closed, will be mapping out the menus at all four spots. New York-based design firm Parts & Labor, which has bagged hospitality design awards for projects like the The Grey in Savannah, will be sketching out the space. More details will emerge later this year. Until then, the neighborhood can take some comfort in knowing that Harker will soon be coming home."
637,0,"Hackers Target Key Russian Websites; A Ukrainian volunteer âIT Army' appeared to bring down the Moscow Exchange website and a number of others, suggesting the digital front of the conflict is entering a new phase.",935 words,WSJ Pro Cybersecurity,"""Mission accomplished!"" they wrote in English. The suspected takedowns are part of a volley of mostly low-level cyberattacks in recent days that have temporarily downed Russian websites or defaced them with antiwar messaging. Ukrainian volunteers and self-proclaimed hacker activist groups, or hacktivists, claim to be behind the activity, while some criminal ransomware operators have pledged loyalty to the Kremlin, suggesting the digital front of the deadly conflict is entering an unpredictable new phase. Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov on Saturday called for volunteer hackers to follow a Telegram channel dedicated to listing potential targets, saying on Twitter, ""There will be tasks for everyone. We continue to fight on the cyber front."" In addition to targeting the Moscow Exchange, the so-called IT Army of Ukraine on Monday urged its Telegram followers to attack the site for state-owned Sberbank. The IT Army administrators' stated goal was to inflict more financial pain as ""people in Russia are withdrawing money from ATMs en masse."" Both websites remained offline Monday afternoon. Representatives for Sberbank and the Moscow Exchange, which halted trading Monday after the U.S. and other governments imposed sanctions on Russian financial institutions, didn't respond to requests for comment. The disruption of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs site came amid days of intermittent outages on other government portals. The global hacker collective known as Anonymous also claimed to have stolen and leaked information from the Russian Defense Ministry, which the Kremlin denied through state-backed media agency Tass. On Monday, Russian media outlets including Tass were defaced with a message that criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin and carried Anonymous branding. Mr. Fedorov, the Ukrainian digital minister, subsequently shared an emoji of the Ukrainian flag in a Twitter post tagging the main account affiliated with the hacker collective. Attributing such attacks to particular hackers is difficult, even for Ukrainian government officials helping to organize some of the efforts, said Alex Bornyakov, Ukraine's deputy minister of digital transformation. ""We don't know exactly who is doing what,"" Mr. Bornyakov said in an interview. Western officials for weeks warned of cyberattacks linked to a Russian invasion that could disrupt key Ukrainian infrastructure and potentially jump to computer systems around the world. Such digital operations have had limited impact so far, cybersecurity experts say, with hackers installing destructive malware [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/destructive-malware-seen-in-ukraine-as-risk-of-cyber-spillover-looms-11645733333?page=1] in several Ukrainian organizations and disrupting web services for some government agencies and state-owned banks. The entry of more non-state actors has added a hard-to-quantify variable to a conflict awash with disinformation campaigns and opaque cyber operations. ""A word of caution: Hacktivists are not always what they seem,"" said Craig Terron, senior manager of global issues for cyber firm Recorded Future's Insikt Group threat research unit. In Ukraine, the volunteer IT force enlisted by the government isn't acting alone. Yegor Aushev, co-founder of Ukrainian company Cyber Unit Technologies, has in recent days been using Facebook and LinkedIn to solicit volunteer hackers from Ukraine, Belarus and other countries for dozens of cyber projects. ""We are united. We are focused,"" he said. ""We sleep two or three hours per day and then we are always online. We don't have shock anymore."" Mr. Aushev said immediate goals include defacing Russian sites with antiwar messaging or graphic imagery of dead soldiers, as well as flooding them with traffic in distributed denial-of-service attacks. Working outside of Kyiv, Mr. Aushev said the teams communicate through secure means, such as the encrypted messaging app Signal, as they also plan out longer-term attempts to disrupt Russian infrastructure. ""We all understand that we have to win,"" said Mr. Aushev, adding that he's coordinating with the Ukrainian military and digital ministry. ""Otherwise, we will die. We will not be under Russia."" Within Moscow's sphere of influence, one prominent hacking group has similarly threatened to join the fight. The Conti ransomware gang [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-02-28/card/chats-leaked-online-reveal-details-about-russian-ransomware-gang-YXACOn6dMVDKqdCzKt4J] Friday pledged ""full support"" to the Kremlin on its website and warned that it would launch cyberattacks against critical infrastructure of countries that organize ""any war activities against Russia."" Cybersecurity experts say the message shows how ransomware gangs that operate largely out of Russian-speaking countries can serve as an extension of Moscow's foreign policy. The fear is that non-state actors' entrance into the fight on either side could add confusion that leads to escalation between Russia and other countries, said Kellen Dwyer, a partner at law firm Alston & Bird LLP and a former deputy assistant attorney general in the U.S. Justice Department's national-security division. ""There's the possibility for misfires, misattribution and miscalculations that really concerns me,"" he said.

Versus two years ago, third quarter sales were up 20%. ""Customers responded well to our winter sale held in the first few weeks of the quarter, with a very strong sales performance across most categories. We have continued to refresh our product ranges, with our new 'Summer Living' products performing particularly well during March, as customers looked to ready their homes and gardens for summer,"" Dunelm stated. The company said its gross margin in the third quarter increased by 30 basis points year-on-year, and was better than expected due to a slightly lower proportion of sales from discounted lines during the Winter Sale. At 26 March, Dunelm had net debt of GBP14 million. This compares to net cash of GBP40 million in the comparable period a year before. It explained this followed the payment of GBP75 million as a special dividend announced at its interim results in February. The company continues to expect that its pretax profit for financial 2022 will be in line with the latest market expectations. It noted that the latest range of analyst forecasts puts its pretax profit between GBP195 million to GBP215 million, with the consensus at GBP207 million. In financial 2021, it posted a pretax profit of GBP157.8 million. ""Performance has been strong across all channels and our new facilities for e-commerce and furniture fulfilment are now fully operational, which will enhance our multi-channel proposition, whilst providing the capacity for further growth"" Chief Executive Nick Wilkinson commented.

DDoS incidents also disrupted web services of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and PrivatBank and Oschadbank, the country's largest lenders, according to the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine. It said in a statement that a working group of Ukrainian cyber experts ""is taking all necessary measures to resist and localize the cyberattack."" Security experts have warned in recent weeks of cyberattacks targeting Ukrainian infrastructure as Russian troops mass on the country's border in what Western officials fear is a prelude to an invasion. U.S. and European officials also fear that the effects of more destructive hacking campaigns, such as attacks aimed at disabling computer networks or corrupting sensitive data, could ripple across borders. Victor Zhora, chief digital transformation officer at the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine, said it is too early to attribute Tuesday's incidents to a particular hacker or group. He also said ""the attack continues."" The incident at PrivatBank spanned several hours, leaving services including automated teller machines down for an hour, a spokesman said. While the bank restored its services, it still faces ""instability"" on its Privat24 mobile app and is working to secure its operations, the spokesman said. Representatives for Oschadbank, the other lender mentioned by Ukrainian officials, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House is aware of the reports and has ""reached out to Ukrainian counterparts to offer support in the investigation and response to these incidents,"" a National Security Council spokeswoman said. She declined to comment further. It is possible such attacks could be carried out by Russian-linked hackers or opportunistic cybercriminals, said Kostiantyn Korsun, co-founder of the Ukrainian cyber firm Berezha Security Group.

The Kremlin denied involvement in the incidents. A disruption of government services can be ""very effective because it's visible for millions of people at the same moment,"" Mr. Korsun said. Officials in the U.S., U.K., Canada and elsewhere in recent weeks have warned that cyberattacks linked to a Russian invasion of Ukraine could spread across international computer networks and disrupt infrastructure. Last week, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a ""Shields Up"" alert urging companies to update their systems, impose multifactor authentication and more aggressively monitor for unusual activity. Some U.S. companies have been taking such actions[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/articles/companies-prepare-for-fallout-from-cyberattacks-against-ukraine-11643151083] even if they don't do business in Ukraine. ""While there are not currently any specific credible threats to the U.S. homeland, we are mindful of the potential for the Russian government to consider escalating its destabilizing actions in ways that may impact others outside of Ukraine,"" CISA said.

545,0,Isolation rules ârobbing' hotels of the few staff they have,630 words,AFR Online,"Employees who tested positive to COVID-19 or were isolating as close contacts were the reason for service restrictions in just under 80 per cent of businesses, the survey found, topping labour shortages at 69.7 per cent and low occupancy rates at 39.4 per cent. Tourism Accommodation Australia chief executive Michael Johnson said hotels had already been facing chronic staff shortages due to lack of visa workers but the poll showed that omicron ""has robbed them of what little staff they had"". ""Accommodation hotels are being crippled by rules around isolating of close contacts which could revert to âmonitor for symptoms' to allow them to work,"" he said. State and federal governments are reluctant to extend relaxed isolation [https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/workplace/hospitality-retailers-jockey-to-remove-covid-19-rules-20220110-p59n4h]rules to hospitality and retailers because those sectors' interactions with the public could exacerbate the spread of the virus. Data from SevenRooms, a guest platform for the hospitality industry whose clients include Merivale and Hunter St Hospitality (formerly Rockpool), found that omicron was driving a wave of cancellations and no-shows. [https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/restaurants-empty-as-diners-staff-show-omicron-caution-20220105-p59m2p]  However, it was not as stark as it was in early days of the pandemic. Cancellation rates increased to 20.4 per cent over December and January, compared to 66 per cent in March-April 2020. Sydney was the worst hit at 26 per cent, compared to 48.4 per cent at the start of the pandemic, while Melbourne spiked at 23 per cent. Australian Hotels Association national chief executive Stephen Ferguson, representing pubs and hotels, said more than 100,000 positions were vacant across the sector nationally. ""Our industry is struggling to recover from the worst 18 months in our history and the recovery is being hampered by a dire skills shortage across the nation,"" he said. He said temporary visa changes announced on Wednesday to allow working holiday makers to work until the end of the year, rather than just six months, would increase the country's competitiveness for labour. Mr Johnson said Tourism Accommodation Australia was in contact with governments about relaxing some of the guidelines for back-of-house staff such as chefs, kitchen hands and housekeepers who do no have regular contact with the public. ""Hotels are capping occupancies because they can't clean rooms while a number of hotels are restricting what their dining operations are because their kitchens are hard hit,"" he said. ""These are the heart of hotels and if your heart not's going it's very hard to run them."" He said the latest outbreak had reduced occupancy in CBD hotels to less than half of what it should be at this time of year. Occupancy was better in the regions, but the lack of staff in those areas meant many hotels had to turn away much needed revenue. Restaurant & Catering Association chief executive Wes Lambert backed the call to exempt back-of-house staff as a compromise measure, saying they were critical to cafes and restaurants staying open. ""The shortages are about 40 per cent back of house, 60 per cent front-of-house,"" he said. ""A manager or owner may be able to fill in for front-of-house staff but if they're not qualified they would find it difficult to fill in for a pastry chef or cook."""
660,1,"Statistics Canada says manufacturing sales up in February, wholesale sales down",422 words,The Canadian Press,"The overall increase came as sales of motor vehicles rose 25.0 per cent to $3.7 billion in February, the highest level since January 2021, even as some highway crossings between Canada and the U.S. were blocked temporarily by those protesting pandemic health restrictions.  Statistics Canada said the blockades contributed to a 5.0 per cent drop in exports of motor vehicles and parts in February. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the February figures were much better than expected even though the blockade at the key Ambassador Bridge border crossing weighed on exports. ""Admittedly, price gains played a role in the nominal sales gain, with producer prices increasing by 3.1 per cent, but sales volumes still increased by a solid 2.2 per cent, more than reversing the Omicron-related dip in January,"" Ashworth wrote in a report.  Statistics Canada said the protests impacted about 17.7 per cent of manufacturing plants, with 13.2 per cent reporting disruptions in transportation and 8.3 per cent reporting shortages of raw materials. In addition to the gain in the motor vehicle sector, sales of food products gained 5.3 per cent on grain and oilseed milling and meat products, while petroleum and coal industry sales rose 6.7 per cent, due in large part to higher prices. Sales of wood products gained 8.5 per cent at $4.5 billion in February. Meanwhile in a separate report, Statistics Canada said wholesale sales fell 0.4 per cent in February to $78.8 billion, the first drop since July 2021.

958,0,"As Covid cases surge in Agra, gyms to be closed, hotels, restaurants to run at 50% capacity",504 words,The Times of India,"Strict action will be taken against those found violating the Covid-19 protocol.ï¿½?While not surprised by the decision, president of the Agra Hotel and Restaurant Ownersï¿½?Association Ramesh Wadhwa said they are yet to recover from the losses suffered due to the first and second wave of Covid-19. Around 5 lakh people are associated with the tourism industry in Agra. âWith orders of operating at 50% capacity, hotel and restaurant owners will have no option but to curtail 50% of the workforce,ï¿½?said Wadhwa. He appealed to the government to consider the difficulties and financial distress the industry is facing for the past two years and help by offering concessions and compensation.A gym owner, Manjeet Singh said, âWe are following all the required Covid-19 precautions. We are willing to operate with some restrictions but it is unfair to shut down the gymnasiums. Most gym owners have run up debts. Government should either provide us with some monetary assistance or allow us to operate with the required preventive measures.ï¿½?In the past 48 hours, 407 Covid-19 cases were reported in the district. On Sunday, Rajya Sabha MP Haridwar Dubey tested Covid-19 positive for the second time. Earlier, he had tested positive in April. He is fully vaccinated. He has been referred to Delhi for treatment. Chief medical officer of Agra district Dr AK Srivastava said, âMost of the 236 people who tested positive in the past 24 hours are asymptomatic. Swabs of their family members and close contacts have been collected for the RT-PCR test.ï¿½?The cause of concern is the drop in recovery rate from 98.1% on January 1 to 94.62% in just nine days. On Sunday, the sample positivity rate in Agra increased to 1.17%, he added. Since March 2, 2020, as many as 26,761 people have tested positive in Agra district. Of these, 25,323 recovered while 458 people succumbed to the deadly virus. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

735,1,This stock market is showing a frustrating lack of follow-through; The intermediate trend for the S&P 500 still appears to be down,1402 words,MarketWatch,"When the S&P SPX closed below 4420 on a couple of days this week, it appeared that would be enough to engender further selling. Instead, SPX rallied on Wednesday, for no apparent reason. Thus, SPX is still locked in a trading range between Tuesday's lows (4380) and the early April highs (4637), as denoted by the horizontal purple lines on the chart. Outside of that range, there is considerable support at 4100-4200 and resistance at 4700-4800 (horizontal red lines on the chart). Equity-only put-call ratios continue to remain solidly on buy signals, as these ratios are dropping steadily on their charts. The buy signals that originally took place in mid-March will continue to remain in place until the ratios roll over and begin to rise. Market breadth deteriorated after the market made new highs in early April, and the breadth oscillators had been on sell signals since then. On Wednesday, breadth improved enough to cancel out those sell signals and generate new buy signals. As always, this short-term indicator swings back and forth quickly, and none of the oscillator signals have lasted more than a few days in the volatile market that has been in place in 2022. New 52-week lows have been considerably stronger than new 52-week highs, and this indicator has been in a negative mode ï¿½?especially since a confirmed sell signal was launched on April 7. It would take two days of new highs exceeding new lows on the NYSE for this signal to reverse. A new VIX ""spike peak"" buy signal occurred at the close of trading on April 7, and we took new long positions based on that. It will remain in effect for 22 trading days, or until VIX VIX closes above its most recent spike peak of 24.78, whichever comes first. Countering that, to some extent, is the fact that the intermediate-trend of VIX has turned upward again, and that is generally negative for stocks. Both VIX and its 20-day moving average are above VIX's 200-day moving average, and that 200-day MA is moving higher. The recent crossover above the 200-day MA is marked with a circle on the lower right of the accompanying VIX chart. All three of these items are closing in on the 22 area. That could lead to an eventually bullish signal if both VIX and the 20-day MA cross below the 200-day, but that is by no means certain. The construct of volatility derivatives is solidly bullish in its outlook for stocks. The term structure of the VIX futures slopes upward all the way out through October, so that is a positive for the stock market, as is the fact that those futures are trading at a premium to VIX. In addition, the situation is helped by the fact that the CBOE Volatility Indices term structure slopes upward, also. In summary, there are mixed indicators in place, which is not unusual when SPX is swinging back and forth in a (wide) trading range. Both bulls and bears have been frustrated by the lack of follow-through. It certainly appeared that the bears had a chance this week when SPX closed below 4420, but as has so often been the case, no further decline occurred. The bulls experienced the same sense of futility when the breakout above 4600 a couple of weeks ago was not able to extend higher. So we will continue to trade individual indicator signals as they occur, without being overly committed to either the bull or bear case right now. New recommendation: AEye  Option volume in AEye LIDR increased sharply Tuesday on unconfirmed takeover ""chatter."" Stock volume patterns are very strong.

This price offer represents a roughly 40% premium to Frontier cash-and-share offer (around $23) made in early February. The JetBlue bid, while higher in price, also faces a higher hurdle in terms of convincing the Department Of Justice that its proposal will not hurt competition.

45,0,Briefs,239 words,The Australian Financial Review,"Coast mall taps demand spike The Pottsville Central shopping centre, on Coronation Street at Pottsville on the NSW North Coast, has sold under the hammer for $10.2 million, a sale price that reflected a yield of 4.58 per cent. The transaction was brokered by Cushman & Wakefield's Geoff Sinclair and Michael Collins and Savills' retail specialists Jon Tyson and Michael Harcourt. Held privately, the mall was sold also to a private investor. Mr Tyson said demand for convenience-based shopping centres outstripped supply and that interest in retail investments in the Tweed/Byron region was particularly robust. The 908 sq m mall, which has a lease to IGA until 2029, is a single-level shopping centre with a supermarket and four shops, including an Australia Post outlet. It stands on a site of 1962 sq m in a prime position within Pottsville, on the popular Tweed Coast. NICK LENAGHAN"

Open: Lunch Tue-Fri, Dinner Tue-Sat I have a borderline obsession with panna cotta. If itâs on the menu, as it so often is, Iâm going to order it, even though the chances of it being made properly are disappointingly low. Serving it in a bowl or other form of mould is an automatic fail. It needs to stand up on its own. So is making it with so much gelatine that it bounces back from the prod of a spoon like the rubber man in Fantastic Four. The panna cotta at La Locanda, a surprising new Italian in the CBD, is the complete opposite. Give the plate a little jiggle, and it doesnât just get a bad case of the shakes, it begins to quiver uncontrollably. One harsh word or sideways glance and it could completely fall apart. The fragility of this dessert, the exquisite judgment of its surface tension, is the whole point. As well as being sublime when it slips across the tongue, it is a true test of the skill and bravado of its creator. Otherwise you are just making jelly. La Locanda gets this, and most other things, absolutely right. Read the full review here 14. Masa Bowden Brewing, Plant 3, 12 Fourth St, Bowden | bowdenbrewing.com Owners: Big Easy Group Chef: Harry Bourne Food: Mexican Price: Tacos $10-$16, Larger plates $35 Open: Lunch Fri-Sun, Dinner Tue-Sun Hereâs something you wonât see at your run-of-the-mill restaurant or bar. Weâre midway through a batch of next-level tacos at Mexican eatery Masa when a bloke walks in lugging one of those glass flagons known as a growler. He has a chat, orders a refill of his favourite ale, and takes it home. Itâs only six months since Masa opened as the food match to the craft beers of Bowden Brewing and it seems both are very much part of life in the surrounding community. Executive chef Harry Bourne has put together the food for Masa, fashioning a menu that, on one level, is filled with the type of simple Mexican-leaning snacks you might think of when chugging a pint. Dig deeper, however, and you will find the kind of labour-intensive kitchen commitment and skill-set normally associated with the world of fine dining. Take the $13 pork taco. Not only is Masa making tortillas, they are grinding their own corn from a supply of dried Australian kernels. These are cooked, soaked overnight, processed and, finally, rolled and pressed by hand. The result is a flatbread of substance and soul. And the pork isnât the usual pulled shoulder. Whole pigsï¿½?heads are boiled in a huge pot for eight hours before the cheek, jowl, tongue and other bits are stripped away and moistened with the reduced stock. The finished taco has the meat, a roasted apple salsa and puffed pieces of crackling. Boom. Less divisive perhaps is a taco filled with beer-battered Port Lincoln flathead, fermented cabbage and a green salsa of spring onion, jalapeno, lime and herbs. Another veg-based option has chargrilled broccolini, smoked almonds, a chunky almond mole, pickled onions and smoked chipotle. The standout, however, is the crisp tostada (a fried tortilla) loaded up with whipped avocado, chunks of gently poached king prawn meat, habanero hot sauce and a sprinkle of fermented chilli powder. 13. Blue Rose 28/330 Seaview Rd Rd, Henley Beach | 8117 7816 | bluerosehenley.com Owners: Tuoi and Annie Tran Chef: Tuoi Tran Food: Asian Price: Small $12-$25, main $28-$40, dessert $15 Drinks: The list is short but filled with wines, mostly from small SA producers, that fit this style of dining perfectly. Open: Lunch, dinner, Tue-Sun Lazy Susan! What a disparaging name for an invention that should be the centrepiece of a diner-led revolution. The spinning tray at the centre of the table makes passing around food a breeze. Why, then, do the cool-kid eateries, where sharing is next-to-obligatory, continue to ignore this ingenious device with the unfortunate reputation? Blue Rose at Henley Beach is an exception to the rule. This spanking new two-level restaurant from the people behind CBD hotspot Gondola Gondola is very much on-trend with its Sans-Arc design and smart branding. But downstairs, right beside the front window, is a tall, round table with a lazy Susan in matching dark timber. Blue Rose stands out in other ways as well. Rather than duplicate the Vietnamese/Thai/street food themes of Gondola, the Trans decided to incorporate Chinese influences at Blue Rose, a reflection of Annieâs heritage. The result is a collection of dishes that are a refreshing change from the Southeast Asian standards. Read the full review here 12. Down the Rabbit Hole 233 Binney Rd, McLaren Vale | 0448 764 956 | downtherabbitholewines.com.au Chef: Cameron Clarke Food: Contemporary Price: Two courses $70; three courses $85 Open: Lunch Mon-Tue, Thu-Fri (platters on weekends) Imagine a Wonderland with multiple Alices, Harry Potterâs double-decker bus and an assortment of fairytale cottages. A place where every item of boho clothing, every cushion and even the contented chooks look as if they have been painstakingly styled as part of an Instagram ploy. Yes, it is easy to be cynical about the image-conscious motivations of Down the Rabbit Hole, a creek-side cellar door and eatery to the south of McLaren Vale. But, if you are anything like me, it wonât be long before the genuine hospitality and quality of the whole package wins you over. In contrast to most of its neighbours, DTRH restricts restaurant-style service to weekdays, when customers can be given more personal attention. Weekend crowds (and it can feel like one big party, apparently) are offered simpler grazing boards and a handful of specials. Head chef Cameron Clarke (ex-Salopian Inn) and his team know how to make a plate look photogenic but, once again, the style is matched by substance. Read the full review here 11. Seed Clare Valley 268 Main North Rd, Clare | 8842 2323 | seedclarevalley.com Owners: Guy Parkinson, Candice Leighton, Sam Maitland Chefs: Guy Parkinson Food: Bistro/European Price: Snacks $3-$7, main $24-$56, dessert $15-16 Drinks: Excellent list with a strong regional representation (aged rieslings particularly) and other benchmark wines from elsewhere in Australia and beyond. Open: Lunch Wed-Sat, Dinner Wed-Sat Itâs the tale of two dinners. Pumpkin gnocchi, roasted cauli and a stonking pork chop with a glass of nebbiolo for us. And for the mum, dad and teenagers who roll into Seed midway through the evening? Pizzas, chips, Coke and water. The comparison isnât intended to pass judgment either way. Rather it illustrates both the possibilities and the dilemmas for an eatery in a regional town that hopes to cater for all-comers, be they locals or visitors, gastro-snobs or just plain hungry. Between its bistro, rooftop bar and deli, the third version of Seed, now settled into an astonishing re-imagined bank building in the main street of Clare, tries very hard to please everybody.

The Scenic Hotel Old Norton Summit Rd, Norton Summit | 7320 1610 | thescenichotel.com.au Owners: Alistair Wells, Matilda Bryson, Enoch Yates, Jay Marinis Chef: Dylan Marshall Food: Contemporary pub Price: Small $10-$21, Main $22-$34, Dessert: $12 Open: Lunch Wed-Sun, Dinner Wed-Sun âBooking essential, bums on seats, no packet gravy, no pokies.ï¿½?In a world full of marketing over-reach and misappropriated catchphrases, the mission statement for the Scenic Hotel is refreshingly free of bulldust. It tells you a bit about this landmark venue, positioned to make the most of the view from Norton Summit, and more particularly the attitude of the bunch of mates who have recently taken it over. This is no big-budget, bells-and-whistles country pub makeover. The heritage and rough-at-the-edges spirit of this historic, two-storey bluestone building are still intact. Even the grumbliest of locals wonât find much to complain about. The renovations have all been DIY, relying on hard work and a measure of creativity. Daggy wallpaper and carpets have been stripped and replaced with polished boards and fresh paint in twin shades of green. The kitchen and other facilities have been given a scrub. A pool table has been brought upstairs, where it is more accessible. A few personal treasures have been put on display. If you were to say it had the warm, unpolished feel of an early share house, I donât think anyone would be offended. What the four owners lack in financial backing, they compensate for with a wealth of front-of-house and management experience, their combined CVs covering influential restaurants including Golden Boy, Osteria Oggi and the Summertown Aristologist, a short drive to the south.

New Local Eatery 120 Port Rd, Hindmarsh | 8340 4915 | newlocaleatery.com.au Owner/chef: Daniel Blencowe Food: Contemporary Price: Main courses $19-$28 Open: Lunch Tue-Fri; Dinner Wed-Sat One of the minor pitfalls of this gig (and not that Iâm complaining) is that the self-imposed code of prioritising restaurants that are recently opened makes it difficult to revisit an old favourite. New Local Eatery, however, makes the rule worth breaking. Hidden away in an unremarkable shop front next to the Entertainment Centre on Port Rd, this suburban gem has never developed the kind of profile it so thoroughly deserves. That needs to change. This meal only reconfirmed my belief that NLE offers value unsurpassed anywhere in town. For the price of a pub meal or Uber Eats feast, owner/chef Daniel Blencowe turns out dishes that are intelligent and incredibly generous, reflecting his travels across the globe but avoiding the cliches. Whether it is Italian gnocchi, Scandi beetroot or Japanese-style ocean trout, nothing on his menu costs more than $28. And thatâs for the larger dinner plates. At lunch, a Sri Lankan curry, made with fillets of coorong mullet, plenty of cardamom and curry leaves, is a crazy $16. It makes those expensive sandwiches look silly. And, while NLE might not be in the running for too many design awards, the dining space is warm and welcoming, with tables spread around a central bar, eye-catching art on the walls and soft light from the lamps hanging overhead. 8. Bush DeVine Restaurant Pauletts Winery, 752 Jolly Way, Polish Hill River | 8843 4328 | paulettwines.com.au Owner: Pauletts Chef: Thomas Erkelenz Food: Contemporary Set menus: One course, bread, wine, $40; Three plates, $44; Five plates, $62 Dessert $14 Drinks: Pauletts wines by bottle and glass, including aged releases. Matched selection available. Open: lunch daily Hoisin sauce is Chinaâs ketchup (aka tomato sauce). Itâs full of sugar. Kids love it. And while the dark gloop is best known for being rolled in a small pancake with roasted duck, it ends up everywhere And like our dead horse, much of the commercial stuff found on supermarket shelves is simple and sickly sweet. But, as Thomas âErkyï¿½?Erkelenz shows at Paulettsï¿½?Bush DeVine restaurant in the Clare Valley, it neednât be this way. Erkyâs hoisin starts with black beans, soy and a deeply caramelised palm sugar rather than the quick-fix refined stuff. To this he adds three types of native myrtle ï¿½?aniseed, cinnamon and a pinch of lemon. Those underlying notes of licorice and five-spice make it a perfect playmate for a DIY assembly of tea-smoked pork slices wrapped in chewy, charred pancakes with cucumber pickles and a weapons-grade chilli relish. Itâs a porcine Peking duck that arrives via the backstreets of Bangkok and the Australian bush. Bringing together such powerful global players could have turned into the culinary equivalent of a diplomatic meltdown but this impressive 26-year-old chef, calling on equal measures of gut-feeling and research, makes it work brilliantly.

Open: Lunch and dinner daily Is there anything sadder in the food world than the standard pub salad, the pathetic pile of limp lettuce and pallid tomato put on the plate in full knowledge that it is bound to return to the kitchen untouched, to scrape into a bin? The salad at the Watervale Hotel, on the other hand, is a joy to behold. A ceramic bowl is filled with leaves and stems of lettuces, cabbages and other greens; slices of beetroot, cucumber and squash; apple, radish and a mix of petals and blooms. Everything has been plucked or snipped or pulled from the ground that morning. Itâs like frolicking through a magical cottage garden ï¿½?which isnât far from the truth. Because as splendid as the transformation of this historic Clare Valley hotel is, it only tells part of the story. Read the full review here 6. Jolleys Boathouse 1 Jolleyâs Lane, city | 8223 2891 | jolleysboathouse.com Owner: Barry Matthews Chef: Jack Ingram Food: Contemporary Prices: Small $12-$24, Main $34-68 (share) As rivers go, the Torrens isnât quite in the league of the Thames, the Mississippi or even the Yarra. Itâs not a maritime thoroughfare (unless you count Popeye) or a hub of activity, at least not yet. It just quietly meanders by, minding its own business. And, like most waterways running through the middle of a metropolis, pulling a fish from those murky depths is about as appealing as a bad dose of the flu. Eating fish by the river, however, is another matter. Especially if that fillet is Murray cod, anointed with a fermented chilli and sea urchin butter, at the ânewï¿½?Jolleys Boathouse. Jolleys, of course, is not new at all. It has lured diners to the base of the City Bridge for more than three decades. However, after presiding over the establishment for more than half that time as head chef, Englishman Tony Carroll moved on last year, prompting changes that range from replacing the original roof to hiring a new manager. New chef Jack Ingram, also a Brit, is accustomed to his food having to share some of the attention. He and partner Vanessa Cu still own Sunset Food and Wine on Kangaroo Island. Complications with COVID-19, and staff and tourism, have put that business on hold, meaning the pair have found their way to the city for now. Their timing has been spot on for Jolleys. Ingram, who has developed his craft in kitchens including Southern Ocean Lodge and Melbourneâs Vue de Monde, has the right balance of creativity and common sense for a restaurant that knows its clientele arenât there to be shocked or bamboozled. A few pleasant surprises are all that is needed. Like the guilty pleasure of sweet buttermilk Parker House rolls that come with a dish of whipped butter and crumbled chicken skin to slap on as thick as possible while no one is watching. Other plates, by comparison, are a model of restraint, particularly in seafood options that are a high point across the menu. 5. Aurora Restaurant Light, 63 Light Square, city | 7089 9600 | auroraadl.com.au Owner: Nick and Sophie Dunstone / Light Social Enterprises Chef: Brendan Wessels Food: Contemporary Price: Small $12-$29, main $28-$42, dessert $14.50-$16.50 Drinks: Substantial list of Australian producers with shared values. Reasonable mark ups. Open: Lunch Thu-Fri, Sun Dinner Wed-Sat COVID-induced changes in mindset donât come much bigger than that of Brendan Wessels. Little more than a year ago, he was pushing meringue mix into a 3D printer and serving sherbet to suck through a fake hundred-dollar bill at the attention-seeking dâArenberg Cube. Now he is head chef and chief mentor of Aurora, a restaurant based on an altruistic vision of being nothing less than a circuit-breaker for the industry, a place where ego, prestige and unrealistic expectation are set aside and that the work/life balance can be fair and sustainable. He couldnât be happier and, my goodness, doesnât it show. Wessels is originally from South Africa and one section of his menu is devoted to meats and fish from the âbraiiï¿½?or barbecue. Other plates show a mix of influences ï¿½?South African, Thai, French and particularly Japanese ï¿½?all elevated above what is normal by small but significant touches of technical virtuosity. Nothing too flashy ï¿½?just bloody delicious. Read the full review here 4. Sol Restaurant Eos by SkyCity, Entry via Station Rd, city | 7077 3960 | skycityadelaide.com.au Owner: SkyCity Chef: Kane Pollard Food: Contemporary Price: Five courses, $110; seven courses $145 Open: Lunch and dinner daily In the year since the attached review was published, chef Kane Pollard has made significant changes to his approach at Sol. This can partly be viewed as a chef gaining the confidence to back his own instincts in an environment that could scarcely be more different than Topiary, the garden centre eatery where he first made his name. On the flip side, it would seem he is now being given commendable support in following this path. The results are spectacular, with Pollardâs innate connection to the season and his surroundings as strong as ever. Take a spoonful from the spring bowl of asparagus, peas and beans finely diced in a freekeh porridge and it is like delving into a bag of mixed lollies from the vegie patch. The âBe the Beeï¿½?dessert looks like a just-opened sunflower, with petals of dried pumpkin dusted in calendula (marigold) powder. At the centre are shiny beads of mead gel, finger lime and a pumpkin custard, all layered into a treacle snap shell. Itâs a truly beautiful plate that tastes just as good.

Open: Lunch Tue-Sun, Dinner Tue-Sun Cancel all meetings. Turn Out of Office on and the mobile off. Pop the cork on something special. The long lunch is back. Itâs Friday mid-afternoon, well past the time for city workers to return to their posts, and the buoyant groups filling the tables around us donât look like moving anytime soon. There is no checking of watches, no taking urgent calls. Dessert and another bottle? Why not. This realigning of priorities might be one of the silver linings to the disruption of the past year. Then again, it could just be that, in Fugazzi, the CBD has a restaurant with the pizzazz and sense of occasion to encourage wanton misbehaviour. Chef Max Sharrad, who along with wife Laura is a partner in the business, take this American/Italian theme as a starting point and brings it up to contemporary speed. That means a menu where snacks outnumber larger courses, a wood grill and vegetables figure prominently, and wakame oil doesnât feel entirely out of place. Read the full review here 2.

One of the best around. Open: Lunch Wed-Fri, Sun. Dinner Wed-Sat The conversation at the next table goes something like this. Diner 1: âWhereâs Callum? I thought he would be here.ï¿½?Diner 2: âWell, Iâm sure Callum is very busy. He would have been here constantly at the start, helping to develop the menu, finding the right people, making sure everything ran how he wanted. Now he can step back a little.ï¿½?Which is right, to a point. The restaurant part of eleven, the bold city venture from local food personality/entrepreneur Callum Hann (who has surely outgrown the MasterChef tag) and his business partner Themis Chryssidis, can function effectively without them. The cooking is memorable. The drinks list superb. Read the full review here 1.

Vegetarian, vegan and other menus available. Drinks: Top-shelf wine selection with most bottles at $80-plus. Good options by glass or half-bottle. Open: Lunch Fri-Sun, Dinner: Thurs-Sat The starting point is a bowl of lemon aspen jelly with finely diced kohlrabi and halves of twice-shelled green peas that look like minuscule lily pads on the surface of a pond. The finish is a toffee-topped semi-frozen cream and matching syrup, flavoured with the spiky fallen branches of a bunya bunya tree. Think of old wooden boxes filled with toasted marshmallows and nuts. Both are stunning but the remarkable part about lunch at the re-imagined Restaurant Botanic is that every one of the nine courses between are their equal. The standard never drops.

783,0,Wall Street Journal is hit by cyberattack that security expert links to China,667 words,scmp.com,"The Wall Street Journal was hit with a âpersistentï¿½?cyberattack by a foreign government that stole data from the company, the newspaperâs parent NewsCorp said on Friday, and a cybersecurity firm hired to investigate the attack said the hackers had likely been spying for China. âMandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus,ï¿½?said Dave Wong, a vice-president at the cybersecurity company retained by NewsCorp that was formerly known as FireEye. âWe believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit Chinaâs interests.ï¿½?The announcement comes as Washington continues to raise the alarm about Chinese cyberattacks against the US ï¿½?and as Beijing continues to crack down on US news organizations operating in the country, including The Wall Street Journal. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge[https://www.scmp.com/knowledge], our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. China kicked out American reporters employed by The Journal and other US newspapers in 2020, and is considered by press freedom advocates to be one of the worldâs most oppressive countries for journalists. The cyberattack was first reported by The Journal, which said the hackers âaccessed emails and documents of some employees, including journalistsï¿½? In a quarterly report filed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, NewsCorp said it had discovered last month that it was the target of âpersistent cyberattack activityï¿½? âThe companyâs preliminary analysis indicates that foreign government involvement may be associated with this activity, and that data was taken,ï¿½?the corporate filing said. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the hack. Earlier this week, FBI Director Christopher Wray described the threat from Chinaâs government as âmore brazen, more damaging, than ever beforeï¿½? âHere in the US, they unleash a massive, sophisticated hacking programme that is bigger than those of every other major nation combined,ï¿½?Wray said on Monday in a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in California. âOperating from pretty much every major city in China, with a lot of funding and sophisticated tools, and often joining forces with cyber criminals, in effect, cyber mercenaries,ï¿½?he said. Responding to a query about the hacking incident, Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, called China a âstaunch defender of cybersecurityï¿½? and said he was not aware of any âdetailed informationï¿½?about the attack. âWe hope that there can be a professional, responsible and evidence-based approach to identifying cyber-related incidents, rather than making allegations based on speculations,ï¿½?he said. The US government has linked numerous high-profile hacks to China in recent years. One, which stole the personal data of 78 million people from a health insurance company and three other firms, was described by the Justice Department in 2019 as âone of the worst data breaches in historyï¿½? Last summer, the White House said that Beijingâs Ministry of State Security was working with a global network of contract hackers on behalf of the Chinese government. In one case last year, the US said China had hacked Microsoft servers as part of a âmassive cyber espionage operationï¿½?targeting thousands of computers and networks, âmostly belonging to private sector victimsï¿½? The Wall Street Journal said on Friday that it remained unclear how many employees had their email accounts and documents accessed during the cyberattack. They added that âsystems housing financial and customer data, including subscriber information, werenât affectedï¿½? NewsCorp said in its SEC filing that the company âbelieves the activity is containedï¿½?based on its investigation so far."

640,1,Big U.S. banks see higher net interest income as rates rise,461 words,Reuters News,"These moves, aimed at tackling soaring inflation of 8.5%, are expected to bring an end to the low interest-rate environment that banks have faced for most of the past decade, particularly through the COVID-19 pandemic. That should be good news for net interest income, a closely watched measure of how much money banks make from lending. It declined during the pandemic due to interest rate cuts and a drop in borrowing, but is now ticking up.  Wells Fargo & Co led the pack, with net interest income for the first quarter rising 5% from a year ago. The bank also lifted its expectations for 2022, saying net interest income (NII) percentage growth could hit the mid-teens. ""In January, we thought NII would be up about 8%. We're almost doubling that to kind of the mid-teens ... due to the loan growth we've seen, as well as the substantial move in rates,"" chief financial officer Mike Santomassimo on a call with analysts. Overall loan growth was 3%. The NII from JPMorgan Chase & Co's core banking businesses, excluding the markets business, increased 9% from a year earlier, the bank said on Wednesday. Total NII is expected to be more than $53 billion for 2022, the bank said, roughly in line with its February guidance. ""NII is going to get much better. Things are going to normalize,"" chief executive Jamie Dimon told analysts. The bank is still running the numbers and expects to give updated guidance on NII revenue at the bank's investor day on May 23, chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum said. Analysts expect the bank to revise its guidance upwards. Still, some banks said the outlook for rising interest rates is not all rosy. Higher rates could weaken economic growth, crimp lending overall and discourage some companies from transactions that generate fees.  Citigroup's NII grew 3% over the first quarter of last year, but its Chief Financial officer Mark Mason, when pressed by analysts, said it was too soon say what higher rates will mean for Citigroup's revenue this year. He left its revenue guidance at up by a ""low single-digit"" percentage. (Additional reporting by David Henry; Editing by Michelle Price and Chizu Nomiyama)"
798,0,News Corp says journalistsï¿½?emails were hacked in an attack linked to China.,551 words,NYTimes.com Feed,"The hack was disclosed in a securities filing on Friday. The company said it had discovered the attack on one of its systems in January. David Kline, News Corpâs chief technology officer, said in an email to staff members on Friday that the company had notified U.S. law enforcement and opened an investigation with the digital security firm Mandiant after the discovery. Mr. Kline said the company believed the breach had affected âa limited numberï¿½?of email accounts and documents from News Corp headquarters, News Technology Services, Dow Jones, News UK and The New York Post. Other News Corp properties, like News Corp Australia, HarperCollins Publishers and Storyful, were not believed to have been affected. âOur preliminary analysis indicates that foreign government involvement may be associated with this activity, and that some data was taken,ï¿½?Mr. Kline wrote in the email, which was viewed by The New York Times. âMandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus and believes they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit Chinaâs interests.ï¿½?Mr. Kline said that the company believed the threat had been contained and that customer and financial data had not been hacked. âEven though the vast majority of our peopleâs emails and documents were not the target of this attack activity, we take seriously any attack on our organization and our employees, including our journalists,ï¿½?Mr. Kline wrote in the email.

895,1,Q1 Production Sets Barrick On Track to Achieve 2022 Targets,2842 words,The Canadian Press,"The average market price for gold in Q1 was $1,877 per ounce, while the average market price for copper in Q1 was $4.53 per pound. As expected, preliminary Q1 gold production was lower than Q4 2021 including at: Carlin and Cortez following the depletion of stockpiled higher grade underground ore processed in Q4 2021 after the mechanical mill failure at the Goldstrike roaster in Q2 2021; Kibali and Turquoise Ridge due to planned maintenance; and Tongon due to mine sequencing. As Q1 gold ounces sold are 20% lower than the previous quarter, Q1 gold cost of sales per ounce2 is expected to be 10% to 12% higher, total cash costs per ounce3 are expected to be 15% to 17% higher and all-in sustaining costs per ounce3 are expected to be 19% to 21% higher than Q4. Preliminary Q1 copper production was lower than Q4 2021, primarily at Lumwana as planned. As previously guided, we continue to expect steadily increasing throughput at Lumwana over the course of 2022. Notwithstanding the lower production, Q1 copper sales were in line with the prior quarter. Compared to Q4 2021, Q1 copper cost of sales per pound2 is expected to be in line with the prior quarter, while C1 cash costs per pound3 are expected to be 10 to 12% higher mainly due to lower planned grades at Lumwana, as the mine continued to focus on capitalized waste stripping to open up higher-grade mining areas and allow for future production growth over the five-year outlook. Copper all-in sustaining costs per pound3 are expected to be 1 to 3% lower than Q4. Separately, Barrick has received a further $0.3Â billion from Kibali in the first quarter of 2022, which follows the $107 million that Barrick received in dividend payments from Kibali in the fourth quarter of 2021. Barrick will provide additional discussion and analysis regarding its first quarter 2022 production and sales when the Company reports its quarterly results before North American markets open on MayÂ 4, 2022. The following table includes preliminary gold and copper production and sales results from Barrick's operations:  Three months ended  March 31, 2022  Production Sales Gold (attributable ounces (000)) Carlin (61.5%) 229 230 Cortez (61.5%) 115 118 Turquoise Ridge (61.5%) 67 64 Long Canyon (61.5%) 25 25 Phoenix (61.5%) 23 21 Nevada Gold Mines (61.5%) 459 458 Loulo-Gounkoto (80%) 138 137 Pueblo Viejo (60%) 104 104 Kibali (45%) 76 73 North Mara (84%) 56 58 Veladero (50%) 46 39 Bulyanhulu (84%) 45 55 Tongon (89.7%) 35 38 Hemlo 31 31 Total Gold 990 993  Copper (attributable pounds (millions)) Lumwana 57 70 ZaldÃ­var (50%) 25 26 Jabal Sayid (50%) 19 17 Total Copper 101 113 First Quarter 2022 Results Barrick will release its Q1 2022 results before market open on May 4, 2022.

Endnote 1 Porgera has been on temporary care and maintenance since April 2020 and is not currently included in our full year 2022 guidance. On April 9, 2021, the Government of Papua New Guinea and Barrick Niugini Limited, the operator of the Porgera joint venture, signed a Framework Agreement in which they agreed on a partnership for Porgeraâs future ownership and operation. On February 3, 2022, the Framework Agreement was replaced by the more detailed Porgera Project Commencement Agreement (the âCommencement Agreementï¿½?. We expect to update our guidance to include Porgera following both the execution of definitive agreements to implement the binding Commencement Agreement and the finalization of a timeline for the resumption of full mine operations. Endnote 2 Gold cost of sales per ounce is calculated as cost of sales across our gold operations (excluding sites in care and maintenance) divided by ounces sold (both on an attributable basis based on Barrickâs ownership share). Copper cost of sales per pound is calculated as cost of sales across our copper operations divided by pounds sold (both on an attributable basis based on Barrickâs ownership share). References to attributable basis means our 100% share of Hemlo and Lumwana, our 89.7% share of Tongon, our 84% share of North Mara, Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi, our 80% share of Loulo-Gounkoto, our 61.5% share of Nevada Gold Mines, our 60% share of Pueblo Viejo, our 50% share of Veladero, ZaldÃ­var and Jabal Sayid and our 45% share of Kibali. Endnote 3 Total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining costs per ounce and all-in costs per ounce are non-GAAP financial measures which are calculated based on the definition published by the World Gold Council (âWGCï¿½? (a market development organization for the gold industry comprised of and funded by gold mining companies from around the world, including Barrick). The WGC is not a regulatory organization. Management uses these measures to monitor the performance of our gold mining operations and its ability to generate positive cash flow, both on an individual site basis and an overall company basis. Total cash costs start with our cost of sales related to gold production and removes depreciation, the non-controlling interest of cost of sales and includes by-product credits. All-in sustaining costs start with total cash costs and include sustaining capital expenditures, sustaining leases, general and administrative costs, minesite exploration and evaluation costs and reclamation cost accretion and amortization. These additional costs reflect the expenditures made to maintain current production levels. We believe that our use of total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs and all-in costs will assist analysts, investors and other stakeholders of Barrick in understanding the costs associated with producing gold, understanding the economics of gold mining, assessing our operating performance and also our ability to generate free cash flow from current operations and to generate free cash flow on an overall company basis. Due to the capital-intensive nature of the industry and the long useful lives over which these items are depreciated, there can be a significant timing difference between net earnings calculated in accordance with IFRS and the amount of free cash flow that is being generated by a mine and therefore we believe these measures are useful non-GAAP operating metrics and supplement our IFRS disclosures. These measures are not representative of all of our cash expenditures as they do not include income tax payments, interest costs or dividend payments. These measures do not include depreciation or amortization. Total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining costs and all-in costs are intended to provide additional information only and do not have standardized definitions under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures are not equivalent to net income or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Although the WGC has published a standardized definition, other companies may calculate these measures differently. C1 cash costs per pound and all-in sustaining costs per pound are non-GAAP financial measures related to our copper mine operations. We believe that C1 cash costs per pound enables investors to better understand the performance of our copper operations in comparison to other copper producers who present results on a similar basis. C1 cash costs per pound excludes royalties and production taxes and non-routine charges as they are not direct production costs. All-in sustaining costs per pound is similar to the gold all-in sustaining costs metric and management uses this to better evaluate the costs of copper production. We believe this measure enables investors to better understand the operating performance of our copper mines as this measure reflects all of the sustaining expenditures incurred in order to produce copper. All-in sustaining costs per pound includes C1 cash costs, sustaining capital expenditures, sustaining leases, general and administrative costs, minesite exploration and evaluation costs, royalties and production taxes, reclamation cost accretion and amortization and write-downs taken on inventory to net realizable value. Barrick will provide a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures when the Company reports its quarterly results on MayÂ 4, 2022. Cautionary Statements Regarding Preliminary First Quarter Production, Sales and Costs for 2022, and Forward-Looking Information Barrick cautions that, whether or not expressly stated, all first quarter figures contained in this press release including, without limitation, production levels, sales and associated costs are preliminary, and reflect our expected first quarter results as of the date of this press release. Actual reported first quarter production levels, sales and associated costs are subject to managementâs final review, as well as review by the Companyâs independent accounting firm, and may vary significantly from those expectations because of a number of factors, including, without limitation, additional or revised information, and changes in accounting standards or policies, or in how those standards are applied. Barrick will provide additional discussion and analysis and other important information about its first quarter production levels, sales and associated costs when it reports actual results on MayÂ 4, 2022. For a complete picture of the Companyâs financial performance, it will be necessary to review all of the information in the Companyâs first quarter financial report and related MD&A. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to rely solely on the information contained herein. Finally, Barrick cautions that this press release contains forward-looking statements with respect to: (i) Barrickâs production and full year gold and copper guidance; and (ii) costs per ounce for gold and per pound for copper. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions including material estimates and assumptions related to the factors set forth below that, while considered reasonable by the Company as at the date of this press release in light of managementâs experience and perception of current conditions and expected developments, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements and information. Such factors include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold, copper, or certain other commodities (such as silver, diesel fuel, natural gas, and electricity); the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development; changes in mineral production performance, exploitation, and exploration successes; the duration of the temporary suspension of operations at Porgera and the timeline for the execution of definitive agreements to implement the Commencement Agreement, form a new joint venture, and recommence operations at Porgera; risks associated with projects in the early stages of evaluation, and for which additional engineering and other analysis is required; disruption of supply routes which may cause delays in construction and mining activities at Barrickâs more remote properties; whether benefits expected from recent transactions are realized; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; increased costs, delays, suspensions and technical challenges associated with the construction of capital projects; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development activities, including geotechnical challenges and disruptions in the maintenance or provision of required infrastructure and information technology systems; failure to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; timing of receipt of, or failure to comply with, necessary permits and approvals; non-renewal of key licenses by governmental authorities; uncertainty whether some or all of targeted investments and projects will meet the Companyâs capital allocation objectives and internal hurdle rate; the impact of global liquidity and credit availability on the timing of cash flows and the values of assets and liabilities based on projected future cash flows; the impact of inflation, including global inflationary pressures driven by supply chain disruptions caused by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and global energy cost increases following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia; fluctuations in the currency markets; changes in national and local government legislation, taxation, controls or regulations and/ or changes in the administration of laws, policies and practices, expropriation or nationalization of property and political or economic developments in Canada, the United States, and other jurisdictions in which the Company or its affiliates do or may carry on business in the future; lack of certainty with respect to foreign legal systems, corruption and other factors that are inconsistent with the rule of law; damage to the Companyâs reputation due to the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, including negative publicity with respect to the Companyâs handling of environmental matters or dealings with community groups, whether true or not; the possibility that future exploration results will not be consistent with the Companyâs expectations; risks that exploration data may be incomplete and considerable additional work may be required to complete further evaluation, including but not limited to drilling, engineering and socioeconomic studies and investment; risk of loss due to acts of war, terrorism, sabotage and civil disturbances; risks associated with illegal and artisanal mining; risks associated with new diseases, epidemics and pandemics, including the effects of the global Covid-19 pandemic; litigation and legal and administrative proceedings; contests over title to properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties, or over access to water, power and other required infrastructure; business opportunities that may be presented to, or pursued by, the Company; our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions or complete divestitures; risks associated with working with partners in jointly controlled assets; employee relations including loss of key employees; increased costs and physical risks, including extreme weather events and resource shortages, related to climate change; and availability and increased costs associated with mining inputs and labor. Barrick also cautions that its 2022 guidance may be impacted by the unprecedented business and social disruption caused by the spread of Covid-19. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion, copper cathode or gold or copper concentrate losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). Many of these uncertainties and contingencies can affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, us. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. All of the forward-looking statements made in this press release are qualified by these cautionary statements. Specific reference is made to the most recent Form 40-F/Annual Information Form on file with the SEC and Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities for a more detailed discussion of some of the factors underlying forward-looking statements and the risks that may affect Barrickâs ability to achieve the expectations set forth in the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Barrick disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

This unit is also verifying viral fake news, he added. The government on January 21 had ordered blocking of 35 YouTube based news channels and two websites which were involved in spreading anti-India fake news in a coordinated manner over digital media, as per an official statement. Additionally, two Twitter accounts, two Instagram accounts, and one Facebook account were blocked. In December also, 20 YouTube channels and two websites were blocked, the official statement had said. In a written reply to the starred question, Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Singh Thakur said the government has statutory and institutional mechanisms in place to combat fake news. A ""Fact Check Unit"" has been setup under the Press Information Bureau of this Ministry in November, 2019 which takes cognisance of fake news both suo motu and by way of queries sent by citizens on its portal or through e-mail and WhatsApp. ""The unit responds to relevant queries with correct information when the same pertains to Central Government or forwards them to States/UTs in other cases. The Unit also maintains a Twitter account @PIBFactcheck and posts cases of fake news, being busted, on the same on regular basis. PIB Fact Check Unit has so far responded to 30,533 actionable queries,"" he said. For print media, the Press Council of India (PCI), a statutory autonomous body set up under the Press Council Act, 1978, has framed ""Norms of Journalistic Conduct"" for adherence by the media. These norms emphasise the principles of accuracy and fairness as well as pre-publication verification. The PCI has formulated specific norms to refrain print media from publication/ dissemination of fake or false news. For electronic media (Television), all TV channels are required to adhere to the Programme Code under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995. As per the code, programmes should not contain anything obscene defamatory, deliberate, false and suggestive innuendos and half-truths. For digital news, the government has notified the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 on February 25 2021, under the Information Technology Act, 2000 which inter alia provides for a Code of Ethics for adherence by digital news publishers. ""Appropriate action is taken in cases where violation of norms, codes etc., are found. The government also issues advisory from time to time to the media to adhere to the laid down codes,"" Thakur added.

280,1,Shopify adapting equity for a 100-year march; Analysis; Sweeping change in structure goes to shareholders in June,1224 words,Calgary Herald,"This great disparity was shored up this week by company proposals subject to a shareholders' vote June 7. If approved, however, the disparity will be limited to just one person: company CEO and founder Tobi LÃ¼tke. When he leaves, voluntarily or not, it would be the end of a two-class share structure that might have seen control of the firm pass to family members. Such intergenerational transfers ""involve certain risks,"" the board of directors noted in a shareholder proxy, including the possibility of voting power winding up with ""one or more individuals who did not possess the same skills and vision as Mr. LÃ¼tke."" Successful startup firms often go through multiple stages of growth requiring different styles of management to maintain momentum. LÃ¼tke has been there from the beginning and appears to have managed the transition from entrepreneur to longer-term visionary without much difficulty. But the capital structure of Shopify has changed profoundly, along the way weakening his control of the firm's direction. The board of directors decided a course correction was required. It is a problem many startups would love to have as it arises from Shopify's very rapid expansion. Shopify's founders, early investors and first employees were awarded Class B shares, each of which entitled the holder to 10 votes. The idea was to keep control of the firm in the hands of insiders and loyalists at least until it had a chance to grow. Control hardly seemed an issue immediately after the 2015 IPO, when Class B shares made up nearly 90 per cent of the 74.4 million shares and controlled 99 per cent of the votes. But the ratio changed quickly with Shopify's expansion. Every time the company issued shares to acquire another firm or to raise cash, these were Class A. An expanding workforce was rewarded with options to buy shares, or grants of restricted stock units. Both types of compensation featured Class A shares. In all, Shopify granted five million stock options between 2015 and 2021, plus 6.8 million restricted stock units. The result of all was to see the total number of outstanding shares at Shopify soar from 80 million at year end to 2015 to 126 million last December. At the same time, the number of people owning Class B shares fell sharply. Many original investors exchanged these one-for-one for Class A shares, which they could sell on the open stock exchange. The two main remaining exceptions were LÃ¼tke and Klister Credit Corp., an investor. By last month, LÃ¼tke and Klister held 7.9 million and 3.8 million Class B shares, respectively, representing nearly all this class of stock. Even so, this was just 9.5 per cent of Shopify's shares. Given the 10-to-one disparity in favour of Class B stock, this still gives LÃ¼tke effective control over Shopify's strategies. But Shopify's articles of incorporation contain this quirk: If the number of Class B shares slips below five per cent of the combined total of Class A and Class B shares, then his Class B shares will convert to Class A shares on a one-for-one basis. The upshot: His effective voting stake would drop from nearly 40 per cent to little more than six per cent, making it much less likely he could prevent a corporate takeover not to his liking.  Shopify's board of directors began work more than a year ago to make sure control stays with LÃ¼tke. Against a backdrop of a soaring company share price, followed by a collapsing one, teams of lawyers representing the board and LÃ¼tke met what seems to have been dozens of times to produce the following arrangement: Â¦ Klister agreed to convert its Class B shares to Class A, leaving LÃ¼tke (and associated family entities) as the remaining Class B shareholder of any size. This would give LÃ¼tke nearly 40 per cent voting power. LÃ¼tke would be awarded a Founder's share, a new class of share allowing him to maintain his 40 per cent control in future as Shopify issues more Class A shares for acquisitions, stock sales and stock-based compensation. Â¦ In turn, LÃ¼tke will be prohibited from passing Class B shares to family members. The founder's share will lose its value in the event LÃ¼tke sells more than 70 per cent of his current allotment of Class B shares. Since this would represent the unloading of 5.5 million shares valued at $4.1 billion, based on Tuesday's closing price, this condition likely wouldn't be triggered very soon. Will the motion in support of the new arrangement pass at the June shareholders' meeting? Quite likely. With LÃ¼tke at the helm, Shopify has made a lot of people very wealthy, including many employees who joined the company after 2012 and stayed at least three years before cashing out options or share units. Nevertheless, the 66-per-cent slide in Shopify's share price since last November has hurt. The directors' circular points out the new equity arrangement ""maintains Mr. LÃ¼tke's influence over Shopify (which) may have the effect of limiting the likelihood of an unsolicited takeover bid or merger proposal."" Such takeovers generally come with a significant share price premium. Employees, including executives, have been affected. At year end, there were 1.2 million stock options outstanding, plus 844,000 restricted stock units. The value to employees for each of these instruments has declined dramatically. The proxy noted the exercise price for stock options granted last year to executives and certain employees was US$1,280, substantially above the US$591.06 closing price on Tuesday. The other way to look at it, of course, is that, if you believe in Shopify as a 100-year firm, as LÃ¼tke has said he does, this is just part of the high-tech cycle."
999,0,Bank of India refers Future Retail to NCLT,446 words,The Economic Times,"The decision of lenders to file an application to NCLT will having bearing on the Rs 24713 crore offer that Reliance Industries linked entities made to acquire Future Group companies in August 2020.Bank has initiated recovery action against the company following the Rs 3495 crore default on the one-time restructuring scheme between the bank and the company which was to support companies that suffered due to Covid 19.The bank has filed a petition with Mumbai National Company Law Tribunal after the company failed to pay the dues or come up with a debt restructuring plan, said people aware of the matter.Lenders have jointly decided to recommend Vijaykumar Iyer backed Deloitte India as interim resolution professional. Lenders have dues of over 17500 crore which includes Rs 3700 crore offshore bonds and Rs 13800 crore borrowing from local banks.Lenders have filed an application a week ahead of a creditorsï¿½?meeting scheduled on April 21 to vote on the scheme of arrangement proposed by Reliance Industries and Future Group on the multi-stage sale of Future assets. However, the key factor that influenced their decision was the uncertainty of recovery, after Reliance took control of more than 800 of Future Retailâs 1,500 store sites over a month ago citing non-payment of rentals.It takes a minimum of six months to admit a company into insolvency proceedings, despite the 14-day ceiling prescribed by the law. If the company does get admitted by the NCLT, it will allow other potential buyers, such as Amazon, to bid for the company. The Future-Reliance is stuck due to legal challenges posed by Amazon.Amazon and the Future Group have filed petitions and counterpetitions over the deal in multiple legal forums. Amazon claims that the terms of its 2019 investment in a Future Retail promoter firm gave it the first right of refusal in any stake sale in the Indian retailer and also barred it from selling a stake to Reliance entities.The outcome of proceedings at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, which will now resume its hearing on the validity of the Future-Reliance deal, too will have a bearing on the recovery that the lenders would make.

633,1,Big U.S. banks see higher net interest income as rates rise,459 words,Reuters News,"These moves, aimed at tackling soaring inflation of 8.5%, are expected to bring an end to the low interest-rate environment that banks have faced for most of the past decade, particularly through the COVID-19 pandemic. That should be good news for net interest income, a closely watched measure of how much money banks make from lending. It declined during the pandemic due to interest rate cuts and a drop in borrowing, but is now ticking up.  Wells Fargo & Co led the pack, with net interest income for the first quarter rising 5% from a year ago. The bank also lifted its expectations for 2022, saying net interest income (NII) percentage growth could hit the mid-teens. ""In January, we thought NII would be up about 8%. We're almost doubling that to kind of the mid-teens ... due to the loan growth we've seen, as well as the substantial move in rates,"" chief financial officer Mike Santomassimo on a call with analysts. Overall loan growth was 3%. The NII from JPMorgan Chase & Co's core banking businesses, excluding the markets business, increased 9% from a year earlier, the bank said on Wednesday. Total NII is expected to be more than $53 billion for 2022, the bank said, roughly in line with its February guidance. ""NII is going to get much better. Things are going to normalize,"" chief executive Jamie Dimon told analysts. The bank is still running the numbers and expects to give updated guidance on NII revenue at the bank's investor day on May 23, chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum said. Analysts expect the bank to revise its guidance upwards. Still, some banks said the outlook for rising interest rates is not all rosy. Higher rates could weaken economic growth, crimp lending overall and discourage some companies from transactions that generate fees.  Citigroup's NII grew 3% over the first quarter of last year, but its Chief Financial officer Mark Mason, when pressed by analysts, said it was too soon say what higher rates will mean for Citigroup's revenue this year. He left its revenue guidance at up by a ""low single-digit"" percentage. (Additional reporting by David Henry; Editing by Michelle Price and Chizu Nomiyama)"
128,0,Insider Q&A: Blue Apron CEO Findley talks rising food costs,856 words,Associated Press Newswires,"President and CEO Linda Findley said Blue Apron could have tried to further inflate its customer base during that period. But she stuck to the companyâs turnaround plan, adding even more options like premade meals, wellness-focused recipes and add-ons like desserts. The company has also tried to cut prep times; most of its meals can now be made in 35 minutes or less. âI said multiple times, âItâs a pandemic, not a business model,âï¿½?Findley said. âI didnât want to drive growth off this difficult situation. I was really looking to stay the course and build sustainable growth.ï¿½?So far, Findleyâs strategy is working. Blue Apronâs customer base has fallen from its early pandemic highs, but those who remain are ordering more and spending more per order. Findley joined Blue Apron in 2019 from Etsy, where she was chief operating officer. She has also led operations at Evernote and was head of global marketing for Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.com. Findley discussed Blue Apron with The Associated Press. Answers have been edited for length. Q: Who is the typical Blue Apron customer? A: We do tend to see a lot of two-income couples or dual-income couples with very young kids. We also see a rise in singles using meal kits and empty nesters. We have a very wide swath of the U.S., in metro areas but also in rural areas, for every different reasons. So if youâre in Manhattan, like I am, and you have a tiny kitchen, then you donât have to keep a bunch of food around. But if you live in the middle of rural North Carolina, where I grew up, you might have plenty of room but your grocery store might be 20 minutes away and itâs probably only going to have part of what youâre looking for anyway. Q: What keeps potential customers from trying meal kits? A: I think that early on, the assumption was that meal kits were really just about convenience. And when you think about that, thereâs a little bit of a negative connotation of, âIâm too lazy to go to the grocery store.ï¿½?And the pandemic did change that, because as people started trying meal kits, all of a sudden the entire industry started growing. They started saying, âOh, I get it now. It isnât about, âIâm too lazy to go to the grocery store. It is actually about getting better quality, better value, more variety, healthier options.'"" All of those things can come through meal kits. And it changes the dynamic of a food consumption. You know, 40% of food in the United States gets thrown out on a regular basis; the direct-to-consumer model helps eliminate a lot of that. Q: How has Blue Apron dealt with rising food costs? A: Itâs not been as bad as it has been in other industries. We are a direct supply company, so 80% of what we put into a box comes directly from producers. So that means weâre reducing the middleman. Logistics has actually been one of the most challenging things for us. Not even the last mile __ the last mile weâve been able to manage with FedEx and others. Itâs been the line hauls and the supplier side of logistics. So for that reason, we actually did change our pricing structure back in the fall to add a shipping charge. Q: Youâve had a really varied career. What is the thread that ties those jobs together? A: One of the most important things is really, really focusing on the customer and making sure that youâre thinking about customer needs first. Etsy very aggressively said, âOK, what is a shopper looking for and how do we make it easier for them to sort through these tens of thousands of products that that change constantly?ï¿½?It was that shift to a rabid focus on the on the buyer that made such a big impact there. And frankly, here as well. So thatâs number one. Number two is a constant focus on making sure youâre executing against what you said youâre going to do. You canât sit around and just think all day of great ideas. You actually need to drive them to reality. And then, for me, Iâve always seen the greatest opportunities in risk. I just think taking something on that has an opportunity to grow significantly or has a gap between brand and execution is one of the most rewarding things you can do."

438,0,'Our needs have been cast aside': Disabled veterans left furious after hotel close to ceremonies for 40th Falklands anniversary cancels their bookings to house asylum seekers,720 words,Mail Online,"* Some of the veterans cannot walk and need veterans to accompany them * Potters offered the veterans rooms in another hotel around seven miles from Aldershot in Camberley, Surrey Disabled Falklands veterans are furious after a hotel cancelled their bookings for this summer's anniversary events to make room for migrants. Scores of former Parachute Regiment soldiers chose the venue in Aldershot, Hampshire, for its proximity to ceremonies taking place on Saturday, June 18 to mark the conflict's 40th anniversary. The now-elderly war heroes fought to recapture the South Atlantic islands in 1982, a mission which cost 255 British troops' lives. Some of the veterans cannot walk and require carers to accompany them. But their bookings were cancelled after owners of the Potters Hotel agreed to accommodate asylum seekers. More than 28,000 people have crossed the English Channel to reach Britain in the last year. The number who made the crossing in 2021 was treble that of 2020, while in the last fortnight 773 have reached the UK by boat. With the Home Office's residential centres overflowing, it has resorted to placing migrants in hotels. David 'Charlie' Brown, 60, told the Daily Mail he booked a disabled twin room for him and his carer on the ground floor. He has to take liquid morphine every day and can barely walk across the road or stand up for more than five minutes. Forty years ago he fought with the Parachute Regiment's second battalion (2 Para) at Goose Green, one of the major battles of the South Atlantic campaign. Eighteen British troops were killed and more than 60 wounded on the night of May 28, 1982 when the heavily outnumbered Paras defied the odds to capture key Argentine strongholds. The battle is also famous for the posthumous Victoria Cross won by 2 Para commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Herbert 'H' Jones, who was killed leading an attack up a steep hillside. Retired Mr Brown, from Thornton, West Yorkshire, said he was furious when he was told his room had been taken by migrants and his booking cancelled, and worried he would not find another hotel close enough to the ceremonies. He added: 'I'm disgusted. I booked the room last year as soon as it became available because of my specific requirements. 'There are more than 1,000 ex-Paras due to attend the events in Aldershot in June, so all the other hotels are booked up. 'I'm furious because the needs of elderly and infirm former soldiers have just been cast aside, in spite of the significance of the events. 'Aldershot is the regiment's spiritual home. I don't know how I will be able to go because I can barely walk and standing up is agony.' Hotel company chief executive Bob Potter confirmed that the Paras' bookings had been cancelled. He added he had been forced to reach an agreement with Whitehall to accommodate asylum seekers or the hotel would have closed because of a lack of guests. He said: 'We were not taking enough bookings to make it a viable option to keep it open. 'We were approached to lease the hotel for the Home Office as we had to look at alternative revenue streams. 'We are deeply sorry for any inconvenience caused to those who had booked with us.' A Home Office spokesperson said: 'The Government has not booked this hotel as support accommodation during the summer months and any cancellations made for bookings during that period have been made by the hotel without consultation with the Government. 'The Nationality and Borders Bill will deliver the most comprehensive reform in decades to fix the broken asylum system. It will make the system fairer and more effective so that we can better protect and support those in genuine need of asylum.' Potters have offered the Falklands veterans rooms in another hotel owned by the same company in Camberley, Surrey, around seven miles away from Aldershot."

But on the day the drama was released, a Korean netizen accused Jin Ha of illegal photography and sexual harassment through his Tumblr blog ""Korean Flowers in Bloom."" Jin Ha uploaded about 100 photos of elderly Korean women in subways taken without their consent and knowledge. The contents of the blog were published from July 2010 to September 2011.

I deeply regret my actions. and apologize for them."" ""I was wrong to take these photos 11 years ago, and was wrong to post them online.

'Korean Flowers in Bloom' is no longer online,"" he added. Jin Ha's Tumblr blog was no longer accessible as of March 26. ""I sincerely apologize to the senior women whom I photographed. I apologize, as well, to the viewers whom I offended with this Tumblr account. My lack of judgement in 2011 has been pointed out by readers wiser than I have proved to be and for that I am grateful,"" he said. Jin Ha added, ""Thank you again for granting me this chance to rectify this blunder of a blog and for bringing it to my attention when it should have been clear to me from the beginning. I will work diligently to learn from this mistake so that I may never repeat it going forward."" South Korea's law ""Act On Special Cases Concerning The Punishment, Etc. of Sexual Crimes"" states that ""a person who takes photographs or videos of another person's body, which may cause any sexual stimulus or shame against the will of the person who was shot, by using a camera or other mechanism which has functions similar thereto, shall be punished by imprisonment with labor for not more than seven years or by a fine not exceeding 50 million won [$40,800],"" according to a copy of the law posted on the Korean Law Information Center website.

""Once restrictions were lifted, you could dine outside, which was new to many Angelenos who, despite the year-round sunshine and clement weather, don't dine outside as much as you would think. ""People used to favour eating indoors in air-conditioned buildings, but thankfully, due to Covid-19 restrictions, they realised it's nice to be outside, too,"" he says. ""Bars and restaurants started thinking of novel ways of utilising outdoor space. We were ahead of the curve, so when we opened fully in January 2021, after the initial lockdowns and the shorter lockdown late in 2020, we've been busy non-stop. ""We offer casual dining with upscale diner food, with fresh pastas along with cocktails, including a famous aviation gin. Obviously there was a dramatic decrease in jet traffic, but the complex has a playground and ample parking, so it attracts people from the local area and beyond."" The complex, which comprises 92 hectares (227 acres) and includes a flight school and dog-friendly community space, is popular with tourists due to its close proximity to LAX international airport, Santa Monica and the Pacific Ocean. Martin says doing business in the US is easy once the right paperwork is in place. ""When the sale agreed process was in place and both parties agree on everything, we had 30 days to sort everything. We did a lot of due diligence before that happened. Also, buying a house here and renovating it meant we got to know the process."" Good life Martin says life in LA has been good, despite Covid-19. ""It's sunny year round here and we have a great outdoor culture. I like to play golf and go hiking year round. There's also a great Irish community here. The local GAA club, the Cougars, come here for social events. So it's nice to catch up."" The Martin family live in Brentwood, made popular by Larry David from Curb Your Enthusiasm. ""Los Angeles is expensive for real estate, but it's cheaper to buy a property than to rent. Since Covid-19 we added a pool, which is a very LA thing to do."" Martin says LA offers many opportunities to Irish people, but anyone thinking of making the move should look at schools, as public schools vary greatly. ""It's fair to say, I won't be going anywhere from here. Life is great. The Irish community here is very mixed, you get people working in movies and tech, but there's a growing scene with lots of events. Getting together to watch the Six Nations is a highlight. When you're away from home, it's great to watch matches with fellow Irish people."" As for Indiana Jones, has he dined at The Cloverfield yet? ""Not yet, but you never know."""

345,1,A General Assessment Of No-Poach Agreements,3198 words,Mondaq Business Briefing,"No-Poach agreements, on the other hand, are agreements between competing undertakings to limit or stabilize potential employment conditions, not to demand each other's employees, and to fix their salaries and employment conditions to a certain extent. However, such agreements violates competition rules. It is possible that the provisions restricting the ability of the contracting parties to take decisions on their own, especially regarding the wages and other labor claims, social rights or working conditions, are likely to be considered as violations of competition rules. These agreements in question can be drawn up as separate agreements, or they can form the part of a different agreement. The Agreement can be established to restrict one or both of the parties. Rather than the written format, these agreements can also be established in the form of oral interviews as well. However, it is prudent not to forget that verbal negotiations or concerted actions may also cause the same violations in question. On the one hand, competition between undertakings in a free market, ensures that end consumers receive quality goods and services at lower prices and are faced with more options and more innovations and on the other hand, this situation provides higher wages, better fringe and social benefits for employees. Therefore, end consumers and employees emerge as the beneficiaries from the competition between rival undertakings. Contrastingly, No-poach agreements are agreements that unreasonably restrict business life. With such agreements, the competitors put their reconciled will above the normal functioning of both the market and the employment market and cause serious damages to the competition and the market as a whole. In addition, making a wage/right fixing agreement regarding the salary or other rights of their employees at a certain wage/seniority level by the persons who play an active role in the recruitment processes of the undertakings or an agreement by these companies stating that each other's employees will not be recruited constitutes a severe violation of competition rules. The first steps were taken by the USA against these agreements, which can be considered as a violation of competition. Until 2016, these agreements were only seen as ""tortious acts"" and was only subject to pecuniary punishments, but today it is evaluated that; ""It is illegal among employers to not hire certain employees and to fix wages accordingly, Sharing about employment conditions among competitors is against competition, Sharing about employment conditions among rival companies can only be brought into compliance with competition law through neutral third companies."" The change in this attitude of the USA with respect to no-poach agreements can be explained with the modern purpose of competition law, which used to aim price-based consumer welfare, but today it aims to protect the entire process of meeting the product with the end user. The US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission issued a statement in 2016 clearly stating that such agreements are strictly prohibited and that agreements to prevent employment and trade will have consequences not only in legal terms but also in criminal terms as well. The relevant statements asserts that; ""The DOJ (Department of Justice) will criminally investigate allegations that employers have agreed among themselves on employee compensation or not to solicit or hire each other's employees. And if that investigation uncovers a naked wage-fixing or no poaching agreement, the DOJ may, in the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion, bring criminal, felony charges against the culpable participants in the agreement, including both individuals and companies."" 2. THE CORRELATION BETWEEN ANTI-TRUST LAW AND NO-POACH AGREEMENTS Antitrust Law in the United States is a set of laws, most of which are federal laws, regulating the management and organization of commercial life. The rules in this regard are aimed to promote competition and prevent monopolization accordingly. Monopolistic behaviors that are aimed to be prevented within the scope of the concept of antitrust are situations such as; exclusive supply contracts (suppliers' inability to sell to different sellers), high pricing without reasonable cause, refusal to concord, and by linking the sale of two products to each other, forcing the buyer to purchase both even if the consumer does not want to buy the by-product. Such monopolistic behaviors are seem legal in the first glance but affect the commercial life deeply. The underlying regulations are the Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton Act of 1914, and the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914. To briefly explain these three arrangements: The Clayton Act of 1914: Prohibits price-fixing, monopolization, and collusion that unreasonably restricts business. While the Ministry of Justice is authorized to initiate legal action in order to prohibit behavior that violates the law, the parties damaged due to illegal actions are given the right to file a claim for compensation up to three times the cost caused by the damage. Sherman Act of 1890: An antitrust law in the United States that regulates competition between enterprises, passed in 1890 by the Congress chaired by Benjamin Harrison. It is named after Ohio Senator John Sherman, who was the first sponsor of the bill. The Sherman Act only declares monopolies illegal and the Clayton Act defines certain business practices that are conducive to the formation of monopolies or that result from them as illegal. The Sherman Act generally prohibits anti-competitive deals and unilateral behavior that monopolizes or attempts to monopolize the relevant markets. Just as in the Clayton Law, while the Ministry of Justice is authorized to initiate legal action to prohibit behavior that violates the Law, parties who have been harmed due to unlawful behavior are given the right to file a claim for damages up to three times the cost of the damage incurred.  Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914: Prohibits monopolization, unfair competition, unfair or deceptive acts and practices. Within the framework of these laws, legal and criminal sanctions are applied to businesses that act to prevent competition. However, only the US Department of Justice has the authority to impose criminal sanctions. In this context, there is debate about the extent to which antitrust laws should interfere with a business's freedom to do business or protect smaller businesses, communities and consumers. Although some economists and experts think that the aforementioned laws protect the employees and the end user and are necessary for the continuity of commercial life, the existence of those who think that the aforementioned laws actually prevent competition and prevent businesses from doing some practices that are beneficial to the society is noteworthy. The Sherman Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the Clayton Antitrust Act protects end users and competitor firms from market manipulation resulting from corporate greed sourced from the large corporations. Through both civil and criminal enforcement, antitrust laws seek to end fraud, fraudulent pricing and monopolization and anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions. Agreements between rival companies not to hire each other's employees (not to entice employees) or to non-compete (wage fixation) regarding salaries can be considered as a violation of competition rules. When analyzing agreements under competition laws, the term ""competitor"" includes any firm with which the firm competes to hire the same employees, regardless of whether they are in the same line of business. The broad interpretation of the definition of ""competitor"", results with antitrust liability issue for the companies' that conduct certain agreements, even if they are operating in different business lines. 3. OVERVIEW OF DEVELOPMENTS IN THE US AND THE EU A. Developments In The US The first step in preventing no-poach agreements is the Sherman Act, which was passed by the US National Congress in 1890. Section 1 of the Sherman Act ""prohibits any collusion or agreement between several states to restrict trade or commerce"". In 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice filed its first major lawsuit over no-poach agreements against several Silicon Valley companies, including Lucasfilm, Pixar, Google, Apple, Adobe, and Intel. As a result of this lawsuit, the companies' agreements on not hiring each other's employees and fixing their salaries cost the companies exactly $400 million. Thereupon, the US Department of Justice issued a statement asserting that it would expand the investigations and, if necessary, expose companies to criminal investigations. Before 2016, as stated above, no-poach agreements and violations resulting from agreements had only legal consequences. Nonetheless, recognizing the negative impact on worker circulation and employment and the violation of competition law, the US Department of Justice announced its first criminal investigations into no-poach and wage-fixing agreements between rival employers in 2016. In line with these acts, In June 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a guide stating that bare wage-fixing or no-poach agreements between employers, whether made directly between rival firms or through a third-party intermediary, are illegal under U.S. Antitrust laws. In the aforementioned guide, the Ministry announced and warned non-compliant companies' that they will initiate criminal sanctions in the future, that the accusations will be initiated without the need for any investigation, and that they should be especially careful regarding the competition risks that exist in the recruitment processes of human resources. Later, in November 2016, more radical steps were started to be taken in the USA with respect to no-poach agreements. While the US Department of Justice made accusations on a corporate basis until 2016, the DOJ has now started to file criminal complaints not only against companies but also against individuals. In December 2020, the Department accused Neeraj Jindal, the former owner of Integrity Home Theraphy, a physical therapy company, of price-fixing and conducting no-poaching agreements under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. As a result of its investigations, the Ministry claimed that his company reduced the wage rate of its physiotherapists and fixed prices and made agreements with rival companies. A month later, the Ministry of Justice discovered that Surgical Care Affiliates LLC and the companies with which it signed the agreement (the names of the other companies were not disclosed) came together in secret meetings and the DOJ, further discovered that they had made an agreement not to hire each other's senior employees and filed charges of conspiracy against the company and its partners. In accordance with these developments, it would not be wrong to assume that criminal sanctions against companies will continue to be implemented in the USA. So much so that DaVita Inc., which was found to have made no-poach agreements, and its former CEO, Kent Thiery, have been charged in connection with Surgical Care Affiliates' conspiracy charges. In addition, an executive decision on Encouraging Competition in the American Economy was published and it was stated that the purpose of the said executive was to prevent monopolization and anti-competitive activities. B. Developments In The EU  On October 12, 2021, the European Commission announced that it carried out surprise inspections on some companies operating in the play dough industry due to suspicions of monopolization. Ten days later, on October 22, 2021, Margrethe Vestager, head of European Commission of Antitrust Enforcement, publicly declared that this was just the beginning of a series of raids planned for the future. Just three days after this announcement, animal health company Zoetis in Belgium faced monopolization charges. The first step taken by the European Commission on monopolization is the surprise inspection it carried out on a German clothing company in June 2021. Following this step taken by the Commission, other national competition authorities in France, Greece, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Slovenia, who want to focus more on this issue, announced that they will conduct similar inspections in various sectors in the summer of 2021. Despite their announcements, no steps has been taken in this regard yet. Following these steps, Margrethe Vestager, the head of the European Commission responsible for antitrust practices, said in a speech on 22 October 2021 that the investigations initiated were not only looking for traditional monopolization behaviors (price fixing or market sharing... etc.), but also were looking for more complex monopolization violations (such as technical agreements; No-poach agreements, wage fixing and etc.). However, despite these developments, there are currently no lawsuits before the EU competition authority. As we understand from the statements of Margrethe Vestager and the EU's attitude, the EU will probably focus more on no-poach agreements that limit competition and trade in the near future. 4. NO-POACH AGREEMENTS IN TURKISH COMPETITION LAW In Turkey, the Competition Authority considers the agreements between rival companies not to employ each other's employees and to determine wages and to share salary information accordingly as contrary to competition and competition law. Pursuant to the decisions of the Competition Authority, agreements to determine the salaries of the employees qualify as agreements to determine purchase prices, and such agreements aim to prevent competition. Regardless, considering the relationship between Turkish Law and EU law, there is no definite and clear line like the US practices, and agreements not to employ employees within the scope of side limitation in merger and acquisition transactions are not considered unlawful. With the decision of the Competition Authority dated 07.02.2019 and numbered 19-06/64-27,it has decided that the franchise agreements signed by Bfit SaÄlÄ±k ve Spor Yatirim Tic. A.Å are in violation of the Block Exemption CommuniquÃ© on Vertical Agreements numbered 2002/2. In the relevant decision, the Competition Authority states that; ""The basis of the claims that are the subject of the application are as follows; In Franchise Agreements signed between BFÄ°T and franchisees; The non-compete obligations to the franchisee after the execution of contract, which is wide-ranging throughout Turkey, and the non-compete obligation imposed for the contract period or after, including the employees of the franchisee, and again, the provisions regarding employee inducing in the contracts create a competition restriction in the labor market."" Even though the aforementioned decision is not a regulation, it is a significant step in Turkish Competition Law since it stipulates that the relevant contract clauses must be altered if the relevant provisions are not in accordance with competition and competition law. In this context, the Competition Authority evaluated the obligation of non-compete to franchisees and their personnel during and after the contract period, and to imposition of a non-compete obligation on the personnel employed/worked by another franchisee in any of the competing companies. It has been concluded that the aforementioned articles of the relevant contract have an indirect, but not direct, harmful impact on worker circulation and employment, and thus fall inside the scope of Article 4 of Law No. 4054. Such that, in Article 4 of the Law No. 4054, titled "" Agreements, Concerted Practices and Decisions Limiting Competition"", Agreements and concerted practices between undertakings, and decisions and practices of associations of undertakings which have as their object or effect or likely effect the prevention, distortion or restriction of competition directly or indirectly in a particular market for goods or services are illegal and prohibited. As a sanction for this violation, an administrative fine can be imposed on turnover or compensation up to three times the damage incurred may be ordered in favor of the person who suffered the loss due to the violation in the first place. In the agreement between the private schools that are members of TÃBB, the sharing of teacher salaries, and the agreement of the parties was agreed and conforming to another provision, ""Institutions cannot make a direct transfer offer to a teacher or employee of another private school,"" according to the Competition Authority's decision dated 03.03.2011 and numbered 11-12/226-76. The Authority came to the conclusion that the clause in question ""violates competition law."" In conclusion, the decision states that; ""The discussion and sharing of information regarding price policies by the officials of private schools operating in the relevant market at the meetings held within the Association of Private Schools of Turkey and Ankara Private Schools Association can be considered as a violation within the framework of Article 4 of the Law No. 4054, In addition, some of the provisions of the ""Private Schools Principles"" adopted by the Association of Turkey, under the ""Working Environment, Employees, Teacher Recruitment"" and ""Student Recruitment"" sections, can be considered as an enterprise union decision that distorts competition within the scope of Article 4 of the Law No. 4054. The above-mentioned decisions of the Competition Authority have shown us that the agreements made by companies in order to retain their current employees or to provide new employment to their companies may also be contrary to competition law. Competition law in our country has started to develop and enter our lives more and more in the last 25 years. Considering that global competition law developments came to the fore in terms of Turkish competition law only after a while and progress has been made, and the Turkish competition authority has adopted practices parallel to the current dynamics of the TR market, it would not be wrong to say that the US school has gradually started to be adopted in terms of No-Poach agreements. 5. CONCLUSION It is fair to conclude that, since the beginning of the 2000s, with the digitalization and globalization of the world, the state-based order has withered and a company-based order has emerged resultantly. At this point, competition law tries to protect employees, low-budget companies, competition, the usual flow of commercial life, and most importantly, the end consumer. No-poach agreements and wage fixing agreements emerge as a global problem that deeply affects both employees, end consumers and commercial life. The developments against this problem, which started under the leadership of the USA, gradually began to resonate in Continental Europe, and the struggle in this regard became more of a global one. The fact that these tendencies are now being observed in our jurisdiction and that precedent decisions have been made is crucial in terms of safeguarding the rights of both end consumers and employees.

446,1,"At 413 mn, Rlys ticket bookings still 61% of pre-Covid levels",571 words,Business Standard,"In the 2019-20 financial year, Railways received 8,109 million bookings, including suburban and non-suburban segments, which roughly average at 675 million bookings a month. In 2020-21, annual bookings received dropped to 1,250 million ï¿½?a low of 104.5 million monthly bookings. While April and May 2020 had seen a complete shutdown of railway services, the ensuing months also saw muted booking activity (see chart), driving the low figures. In 2021-22, up to February, the national transporter received 3,204 million bookings at an average of 291 million. The ministry had an annual target of 8,594 million passengers in the Budget, which it had to revise down to 3,533 million later. Data shows that by the beginning of the last fiscal year, passenger demand had increased almost eightfold in seven months, which fell sharply again after the second wave. While a return to normalcy following the Delta wave reflected in higher ticket bookings, a comparison of July 2021-February 2022 with the corresponding period two years ago shows a significant gap. âThe difference between pre-pandemic and current figures is definitely concerning. Recovery of Railways is slower than many other sectors. While trade and work-related travel and tourism have declined, roughly 80 per cent of the passengers come from unreserved sections and general class. The gap could not have been that high without the general segment population avoiding travel,ï¿½?a sector expert said, requesting anonymity. The Ministry of Railways, however, believes that the annual recovery is encouraging. âDuring the pandemic, train services were briefly suspended, especially in unreserved class. Slowly those are being reconstituted. As we return to 100 per cent capacity, passenger booking numbers will return to pre-pandemic levels. In reserved classes, we are introducing new services such as 400 Vande Bharat trains, which will augur well for travellers. In view of this, we are poised to have much better numbers in the passenger sector overall ï¿½?evident from the 43 per cent increase in passenger bookings since last year,ï¿½?Gaurav Krishna Bansal, senior railway spokesperson, told Business Standard. However, latest government data shows that the Railways is already running at 91 per cent capacity, with mail/express and suburban trains are at 101 per cent and 99 per cent capacity, respectively. According to experts, these two segments contribute to a large volume of passenger traffic, and the national transporter should have had higher numbers at this capacity utilisation. A Mumbai-based analyst also suggested that lower passenger figures could augur well for the freight side of Railways in the medium- to long-term, as lesser passengers would mean that it could readjust its passenger inventory according to the new demand and use the additional capacity to ferry more goods. Railways primarily earns its revenue from freight, which it in turn uses to subsidise passenger transport."

How do you distinguish Jellyfish from other holding companies? When it comes to the network agencies, as much as theyâre trying to reverse engineer it, theyâre still thinking in terms of performance media versus brand. Theyâre still thinking media versus creative. Theyâre still thinking ad tech and mar tech. Theyâve got very traditional views and narrative and language. And I think thatâs going to require some reverse engineering. I use the analogy that when it comes to size and revenue, we may look like weâre behind in the race, but I believe weâve done the pitstop. We integrated all of our companies, we are one P&L, we operate under one brand, weâve got a portfolio of products and services that cater for the world we live in today. Itâs not digital marketing ï¿½?itâs marketing in a digital world. And I think the difference being weâve said goodbye to performance marketing and hello to marketing performance. Weâre going to reclaim the word performance in the context of marketing, because who doesnât want their marketing to perform? Why canât they symbiotically provide both the performance that youâre looking for, but also the awareness and the brand building? Whoâs your competition? Nowadays, it is the consultancies, the networks, the S4âs ï¿½?even some of the performance agencies that are up and coming. I think that weâre all heading to the same place: we want global, we want the full complement of capabilities, we want to be able to create the assets in all the formats that are required. Advertising is the monetization of attention. And once upon a time, you could get peopleâs attention with far less work across far less platforms for a far longer period of time. Now, itâs just such a challenge, because itâs so fragmented and so quick. Itâs short form, itâs different formats, different platforms, different devices. Itâs just exponentially more difficult to get a message in front of the right eyeballs for the right period of time at the right time. So whoever is trying to produce either a platform, methodology or support services to allow brands to eliminate some of that complexity and concentrate on the message they want to get in front of the people, I would consider them our competitors. What are your geographic designs? Thatâs always a very difficult question for me to answer. We donât really have regional P&Ls. Every single client of Jellyfish is perceived as a global client. The reason why is that, the opportunity may have originated in one region, but often, because of the profile of clients weâre going for, they are marketing globally. So theyâre in all markets. But also we can facilitate their activity from any market. For example, if we happen to have bought or organically grown an incredible team who can support advertising in the metaverse, and theyâre in Japan, because weâve won a U.S. client, it doesnât mean we wouldnât leverage that team to facilitate whatever we need within that U.S. client. And it takes an organization without regional P&L or separate entities, with none of those silos, to do that. How do you approach winning clients? Weâve got very unique relationships with the Amazons and the Metas and the Googles of the world. Iâm not professing to be in the lead. But how weâre set up for success to go after the lead again, I feel like we are in a unique situation. The big pivotal moment for us is when we realized that we need to treat the big platforms like our best clients. We were facilitating, mediating and supporting the advertiser but ultimately, the platform knew who was spending the dollars ï¿½?they knew it was the advertiser that they needed. And they couldnât swap out the advertiser, but they could definitely swap out the partner helping. And so when we realized that we thought ï¿½?we should treat them in exactly the same way. And so we made sure that we understood all the stakeholders, that we understood strategically what theyâre trying to achieve, [and] which markets are important to them. We became certified experts on all of the products that they offer. What ended up happening is like a siphon. By proxy, we leveraged their brand, their reputation, and their recommendations, and started picking up the bigger clients. Because we were walking hand in hand with the platforms, itâs become popular to recommend Jellyfish, because we were completely aligned with them. Now that youâve got some of the biggest global brands saying that 90% of activity and budget is going to be spent on digital channels and platforms, weâre getting into those RFPs.

305,0,RESTAURANT GROUP CORBIN AND KING REPAYING Â£34M DEBT AFTER HIGH COURT RULINGS,620 words,Press Association National Newswire,"Corbin and King was placed into administration in January after failing to repay the debt when MHG called it in, but was also subject to a moratorium giving it two months ""breathing space"" to explore rescue and restructuring options. Last week, MI Squared, another subsidiary of Minor International which owns 74% of the shares in Corbin and King, asked a High Court judge for an injunction to prevent the group repaying its debt to MHG using a loan from the US-based CK Opportunities Fund.  Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Capital Management, which manage the fund, made an offer to buy the restaurant group for the amount of the loan when MHG demanded immediate repayment, but Minor rejected the offer. MI Squared argued that the repayment of the loan to its associate company MHG would be in breach of a shareholder agreement between itself and Corbin and King's directors - including Chris Corbin and Jeremy King. However, Mr Justice Foxton concluded it was not appropriate to grant the injunction sought, finding that while both parties would be likely to suffer adverse consequences, it would be worse for Corbin and King. The judge said in his ruling that there had been ""a substantial falling out"" between MI Squared and the directors of the restaurant group, who had issued ""unfair prejudice"" proceedings against the Minor subsidiary. MHG demanded repayment in January of a Â£14 million loan which had fallen due for payment in 2020, and a further Â£20 million which was due in 2024 but was able to be called in because of the previous default. Mr Justice Foxton said the decision to take the loan from the CK Opportunities Fund was open to the directors because it was on more favourable terms than the MHG loans and because MHG was demanding immediate repayment and the appointment of directors, while the fund was not. He also said the decision to enter into the proposed new loan was backed by independent monitors, who were assigned to the group as part of the moratorium. Lawyers representing MI Squared argued that, because the proposed new loan was ""arranged in secret"" without the knowledge of Minor, and because it was from a source which was content to allow Mr Corbin and Mr King to have a ""continuing role"" in the restaurant group, the judge could infer that the directors were motivated by ""an improper purpose"". However, the judge said he was unable to conclude the decision not to include either MI Squared or MHG in the development of these proposals was anything other than ""another manifestation of the poor relations between the respective sides"". In a further High Court ruling last week, Sir Alastair Norris concluded he would have dismissed an application by MHG to bring an end to the moratorium. However, he said in a written ruling on Thursday that, while he was preparing the judgment following a hearing earlier in February, he was ""told that the loan was in the course of being repaid"". The CK loan is also intended to pay a Â£4 million debt to HSBC and Â£600,000 to the landlord of The Wolseley Cafe in Bicester Village shopping centre, near Oxford."
570,0,Restrictions leave a bad taste in the mouth,689 words,The Hindu,"The fresh wave of COVID-19 in the city has brought with it another unpalatable experience for the restaurant industry, which is reeling under uncertainty and job losses. As restaurants have been restricted to functioning only as kitchens, employees have started leaving the city to avoid paying rent. Meanwhile, those from the city have started looking for opportunities in other sectors. Jugul Kishore, who works as a waiter at a plush restobar, lost his job overnight as the Delhi government issued orders to shut down. He is in search of employment to help make ends meet. âDuring the first lockdown, I was left jobless for two-three months before finding a job of a security guard. Before the second lockdown, I had an inkling that restaurants would shut again so I had applied for a job in advance. This time round, the company does not have a vacancy and I am looking for other opportunities,ï¿½?says Mr. Jugul. âLife was smooth and I was able to take care of my family well before the pandemic hit. However, the crisis has wiped out all my savings and I am unable to buy a phone for my Class VII daughter to attend online class. I have to think about how to share my phone with her while looking for a job,ï¿½?says Mr. Jugul. âGovt. should helpï¿½?He says that those employed in government jobs or the IT sector do not face job losses and wonders why it is the hospitality sector that is being singled out despite restaurants taking all precautions to ensure the safety of staffers and customers. âThe government needs to help us out financially in this time. It is easy to announce closure but how does one survive without a job? Compensation is offered to those families who have had COVID-19 victims, but what about those who are struggling to live?ï¿½?Mr. Jugul asks. The National Restaurantsï¿½?Association of India (NRAI) estimates that there are about 95,187 eateries in Delhi, of which 32,777 are organised restaurants with an FSSAI number and pay GST. âWe are worried about the fate of 3,01,715 people employed in Delhi restaurants. We donât want them to suffer, but unfortunately we donât have adequate resources to support them for long,ï¿½?says NRAI president Kabir Suri. Abhishek Patel, who manages a restaurant in south Delhi, says that most of his colleagues are from Himachal and Uttarakhand and they have already left for home so that they do not have to pay rent when restaurants are shut. âIt is better to go stay with family back home. My restaurant owners supported me financially through the previous lockdowns but many have lost jobs and had to find other sources of income. I do not have a background where there is any work for me at home. I have been away from my family for the last 12 years so I looked at it optimistically,ï¿½?says Mr. Patel. He adds that jobs are hard to find in this situation and the only option is to play the waiting game and hope things get back to normal. Tough to survive As established restaurants negotiate with landlords over rent, freshers in the field see their hopes and aspirations shattered as they had only recently signed agreements for their ventures. Sahil Bhalla, who started a cafÃ© on December 15, 2021, says the response was positive for the first 15 days but just as the word spread and positive reviews started coming in, COVID restrictions were announced. âOver the past week, we have been getting only 7-10 orders a day via online ordering platforms and 5-10 takeaways during the week when there is no curfew. With such small numbers it is very tough to survive as running costs are high,ï¿½?said Mr. Bhalla. However, he adds that another cloud kitchen venture of his is doing well as there are minimum running costs."

782,0,'Small portion' of customer data accessed without authorisation in security breach at Hong Kong online shopping platform,647 words,scmp.com,"A security breach at one of Hong Kongâs largest online shopping platforms last month led to the unauthorised access of customer information such as delivery addresses, recipient names and contact numbers. Hong Kong Technology Venture Company Limited (HKTV), HKTVmallâs parent company, said on Friday it had detected âabnormal and suspicious activitiesï¿½?in its computer systems on January 26 as servers located in other Asian regions gained unauthorised access to customer information on its delivery platform. âA small portion of the 4.38 million registered customer information at HKTVmall was accessed,ï¿½?it wrote in a statement. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge[https://www.scmp.com/knowledge], our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. âHKTV has immediately contained the event and conducted a thorough investigation. It has since engaged one international and one local leading cybersecurity firm on January 27, 2022 to conduct investigation, and to further enhance HKTVmallâs robust network and system security measures in addition to the current 24-hour network security monitoring.ï¿½?It added that there was no evidence of financial loss or misuse of customer data, while credit card information and order details were untouched. HKTVmall is one of the cityâs most popular online retailers. In January, it handled nearly HK$700 million (US$89.9 million) worth of purchases, processing a daily average of about 47,400 orders. Based on its investigation, it concluded that the affected customer information might include names of account holders, encrypted and masked login passwords, email addresses, recipientsï¿½?names, delivery addresses and contact numbers for orders placed between December 2014 and September 2018. The date of birth, recipientsï¿½?names and email addresses for HKTVmall accounts linked to Facebook accounts and Apple ID might also have been accessed. HKTV promised it would take responsibility for any unauthorised purchases made as a result of the data breach. Its vice-chairman and group CEO Ricky Wong Wai-kay apologised on behalf of the company. âWe hereby express our sincere apology to the affected customers,ï¿½?he said. âUpon discovery of such an incident, the group management, our technical department and the two cybersecurity firms made continuous efforts to investigate and strengthen system security, and will make full effort to prevent further attacks.ï¿½?The company said it had implemented measures to ensure network security and reduce vulnerabilities. It had launched a review to limit the amount of client data that would be collected and retained. It also reported the breach to police and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data. Francis Fong Po-kiu, honorary president of the Hong Kong Information Technology Federation, said although only a small portion of the information was involved, there might be tens of thousands of accounts based on the large number of customers using the platform. âAs the passwords are all encrypted, they probably will not be leaked,ï¿½?he said. âThe biggest problem is that some hackers may pose as staff from other companies and call the affected customers. By stating the customersï¿½?account names or personal information such as phone numbers and addresses, they may lure the customers into providing passwords or verification codes.ï¿½?He urged consumers to be vigilant about such calls or emails. Users should also consider changing the passwords of their accounts on the platform, Facebook or Apple ID and enabling two-step verification as a precaution, he added."
604,0,The government's corona group is twisting the restaurant lock - corporate corona subsidies are also on the table*** TRANSLATED ***,488 words,STT,"According to STT, the time window makes it difficult to make guidelines. The group has wondered how the effectiveness of the closure and the development of the disease situation can be assessed at this stage, when restaurant closures would only take effect in a couple of weeks. The timetable would be stretched by the fact that the closure would require legislation, in which case the round of opinions and parliamentary deliberations would require their own time. Ministers will have to wonder whether all restaurants should be closed, as the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health(STM) has wanted. One option is to close only bars and pubs, as recommended by the Department of Health and Welfare(THL). THL recommends closing the on-demand restaurants as soon as possible. Government sources say that classifying restaurants into food restaurants and on-premises restaurants can be tricky by law. Even after the morning's talks, government sources were skeptical about reaching a decision today. Today, restaurants should close at 6 p.m. New corona subsidies The government has also prepared new subsidies for companies affected by interest rate restrictions, and ministers are expected to be guided by this. Prime Minister Sanna Marin(sd.) Has also stated that if a restaurant closure is reached, restaurant compensation must be part of the whole. The subsidies would be similar to those used in the past, ie cost subsidies, closure compensation and unemployment benefits, but with little specification. A support package for the first draft amending budget for the year, due in early February, is being prepared. Just in case Ministries have also been asked to evaluate and prepare regulations for the introduction of possible contingency clauses just in case, but hardly anything is happening today. The settings must be ready if the situation requires it. Marin said yesterday in Iltalehti's presidential election exam that the preparation of the readiness law has been done as official work and the presentation may have to be brought in the coming weeks. - We hope that we will not get into this, but unfortunately we will also have to prepare for it, Marin said. In practice, sections of the Emergency Preparedness Act might be needed to relieve the hospital burden if, for example, there are no other arrangements for nursing staff. *** DISCLAIMER: THIS IS AN AUTOMATED TRANSLATION FROM FINNISH ***"
350,1,Mortgage rates top 5% as homebuying becomes 'most expensive in a generation',770 words,Deseret News,"Higher rates from the Fed will heighten borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and corporate loans. In doing so, the Fed hopes to cool economic growth and rising wages enough to rein in high inflation, which has caused hardships for millions of households and poses a severe political threat to President Joe Biden. Many economists have said they worry that the Fed has waited too long to begin raising rates and that the policymakers might end up responding so aggressively as to trigger a recession Earlier this week, the Department of Labor reported the annual U.S. inflation rate hit 8.5% in March, the highest since 1981. And Utah was among a group of Mountain West states feeling even tougher inflationary pressure with a nation-leading annual inflation rate of 10.4% in March. So, what does it mean for a current homebuyer? According to Thursday reporting by The Wall Street Journal, buying the median American home at prevailing rates a year ago meant a monthly mortgage bill of about $1,223 after a 20% down payment, according to calculations by George Ratiu, an economist at Realtor.com. At recent rates, such a purchase would require a monthly payment of nearly $1,700 - a 38% increase, he estimated. And in the West, especially for buyers inÂ high-demand states like Utah, impacts of ongoing rate increases could be even worse. Last month, as the nation's average 30-year f ixed mortgage rate was nearing 4%, a striking 67% of Utah households were already being ""priced out"" of the state's median-priced home, according Dejan Eskic, senior research fellow at the University of Utah's Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute who specializes in housing research. ""It's bad,"" Eskic said. Utah's median-priced, single-family home was $512,000 statewide in the fourth quarter of 2021, according to the National Association of Realtors. ""A good two-thirds of Utah cannot afford the median-priced home anywhere because of how fast rates rose in the last couple of months,"" Eskic said in the March story. ""If you were going to wait to buy in the spring, you're likely out of luck,"" Eskic said, as rising interest rates push even more homes out of reach with higher monthly loan payments. Utah's housing problem continues to be a supply and demand issue - so shouldn't rising interest rates help by dampening demand? Not in today's market, Eskic said. Rising interest rates will slow demand, he said, but not ""enough to completely slow the market down because there is nothing to buy."" The COVID-19 pandemic upended the whole nation's housing market as thousands of Americans reevaluated their lives and moved out of big cities in search of more space at lower price points.Â Many looked West, especially to states like Utah, where jobs flourish, and Idaho, where housing was comparably affordable. As a result, states likeÂ Utah and Idaho have seen record-shattering yearsÂ for house sales and price increases.Â In Utah, experts have warned of aÂ ""severely imbalanced"" housing marketÂ as demand continues to woefully outpace supply. But this isn't just the fault of the pandemic. It only compounded and accelerated Utah's housing problem. TheÂ West's housing shortage began years agoÂ amid the Great Recession, after the subprime mortgage crisis sent the nation's and the world's economy into a death spiral. After the crash, homebuilding contracted, and the market has been struggling to keep up with demand ever since. Contributing: Associated Press"
566,0,Keeping schools closed in view of COVID-19 not justified: World Bank education director,513 words,The Telegraph,"Saavendra also asserted that it does not make sense from a public policy perspective to wait till children are vaccinated before reopening schools as there is âno scienceï¿½?behind it. âThere is no relation between opening schools and the spread of Coronavirus. There is no evidence linking the two and there is no justification now to keep the schools closed,ï¿½?Saavedra said in an interview from Washington adding, âIt does not make sense to keep restaurants, bars and shopping malls open and keep schools closed. There is no excuse.ï¿½?According to various simulations by the World Bank, health risks for children if schools are opened are low and the cost of the closure is extremely high. âDuring 2020, we were navigating in a sea of ignorance. We just did not know what is the best way of combating the pandemic and the immediate reaction of most countries in the world was, letâs close schools,ï¿½?he said. âMany countries have also had waves when schools were closed, so obviously there has been no role of schools in some of the spikes,ï¿½?stressed Saavendra, adding that severe symptoms of infection in children were rarely reported. Talking about the impact of school closures owing to the pandemic in India, Saavedra said that the impact is more severe than previously thought and the learning poverty ï¿½?being unable to read and understand simple texts by the age of 10 years ï¿½?is likely to increase much more than anticipated. âThe learning poverty in India is expected to increase from 55% to 70% due to learning loss and more out-of-school children. In countries like India where the inequalities in education were already prevalent before the pandemic and the learning poverty levels were already gigantic, there is a lot at stake. Nearly two years later, schools remain closed for millions of children,ï¿½?he said. The potential increase of learning poverty might have a devastating impact on future productivity, earnings and well-being for this generation of children and youth, their families and the worldâs economies, added Saavendra. Rationalising the curriculum, reorganising the academic calendar, preparing the teachers for the huge task ahead are among the suggestions that the World Bank has made to reduce long-term learning losses caused by closure of schools during the pandemic. A 2020 report by the World Bank Education, titled âBeaten or Broken? Informality and COVID-19 in South Asiaï¿½? had predicted that the prolonged closure of schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India may cause a loss of over USD 400 billion in the countryâs future earnings."

75,1,Helping Latino businesses thrive,969 words,Austin American-Statesman,"""Once minority businesses are created, they are not growing at the same rate as their majority-owned counterparts,"" said Josh Daspit, a Texas State associate professor in the Department of Management and a founder of SCALEUP. ""Focusing on this issue is an opportunity where Texas State is uniquely positioned to make a difference with meaningful impact."" The aim of the program, Daspit said, is more business growth, which leads to a better economy, greater employment and more income for families. SCALEUP's research fellows will study local business owners, like those at Red Door, and gauge their success before using their findings to develop tools for other business owners. Buda's Red Door, which offers clothes, shoes, jewelry, home dÃ©cor, and other accessories, is one of millions of minority-owned companies in the United States, and one of several thousand in Texas, according to researchers. But the journey has not been easy, Montemayor and Keitz said. ""Buda wasn't where it was 16 years ago,"" Montemayor said. ""Buda has just exploded. When we first started, we were the only boutique. Back then in downtown Buda there were only antique (shops)."" Today, the boutique occupies its largest space to date and has several part-time employees to help run the store and social media accounts, including local teenagers. But the pair said it took 16 years of patience and willingness to embrace change and growth. ""We were barely getting by, but this is what we wanted to do, and we were not going to give up,"" Montemayor said. ""We moved a lot because of the economy, and rent is high, but this was a blessing."" The barriers facing businesses According to research from SCALEUP, Latino-owned businesses overall tend to start small and remain small, but if Hispanic-owned firms grew at the same rate as white-owned firms, as much as $2.5 trillion would be added to the nation's economy and more than 10 million jobs would be created. But something is stopping those businesses from growing, and three research fellows at Texas State ï¿½?Sid Anderson, assistant professor in the Department of Marketing, Omar LÃ³pez, associate professor in the Department of Organization, Workforce and Leadership Studies, and Min Wan, assistant professor in the Department of Management ï¿½?will take the next year to look at what those factors are. SCALEUP's research fellowships are partly paid for by a $25,000 grant from San Antonio-based Frost Bank. Anderson said business owners of color face a number of cultural barriers, including access to capital, distrust of financial institutions and a lack of mentors. The odds of a $100,000 loan approval from a national bank are 60% lower for Latinos than for white business owners, even after considering business performance. External capital is critical not just for weathering the coronavirus pandemic but to continue growth, according to the 2021 State of Latino Entrepreneurship report produced by Stanford University's Graduate School of Business. Work-family issues also can be a barrier for entrepreneurs, Wan said. ""Work-family balance is a critical thing,"" Wan said. ""A lot of people are working from home more than ever before. So, we are looking into what kind of resources are needed or need to be updated by employers to coincide with the current values and changes of the work-family balance dynamic, especially after the pandemic."" LÃ³pez said their multidisciplinary approach allows the research team to account for different perspectives so they can identify where bottlenecks are and where training is needed. The group will be focusing on Hispanic-owned businesses, but the idea is to take the research and adapt it for other communities of color. ""If we are going to help (solve this problem), we have to understand the context our community is in and that is defined by culture more than anything else,"" LÃ³pez said. The road to growth Montemayor and Keitz said moving into their new space on Main Street gave them exposure to foot traffic downtown, and they've seen growth from having an online presence. Montemayor's daughter, Marisol Consier, joined the team recently and helped to move the business into a technology-driven model with social media accounts on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, and an online store using digital bookkeeping and checkout systems. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Montemayor said, the online store helped the boutique have a steady flow of income. It has since joined other businesses across the globe that have reopened in person. The store uses Instagram to highlight products, and it allows customers to order items through the platform as well. ""But this did not just happen overnight,"" Keitz said. ""We built a following over the years and have really tried to listen to our customers and learn from our (young) employees about what they want and what they are looking for."""

745,0,"Fox viewers transformed after watching CNN for 30 days, report finds",655 words,Independent Online,"The study titled âThe manifold effects of partisan media on viewersï¿½?beliefs and attitudes: A field experiment with Fox News viewersï¿½?by David E Brockman and Joshua L Kalla was conducted in September 2020 and published last week. âOf 763 qualifying participants, we then randomised 40 per cent to treatment group. To change the slant of their media diet, we offered treatment group participants $15 per hour to watch 7 hours of CNN per week, during Sept. 2020, prioritising the hours at which participants indicated they typically watched Fox News,ï¿½?the study said. The study found changes in attitudes and policy preferences about Covid-19 [https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/covid-19], evaluations of then president Donald Trump [https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/donald-trump] and Republican candidates as well as elected officials. âDespite regular Fox viewers being largely strong partisans, we found manifold effects of changing the slant of their media diets on their factual beliefs, attitudes, perceptions of issuesï¿½?importance, and overall political views,ï¿½?the authors of the study said. They found that participants became more likely to agree that if Donald Trump made a mistake, Fox News would not cover it. âCNN provided extensive coverage of Covid-19, which included information about the severity of the Covid-19 crisis and poor aspects of Trumpâs performance handling Covid-19. Fox News covered COVID-19 much less,ï¿½?said the study.  Trump news -live updates [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-news-latest-jan-6-calls-b2050247.html]  It found that Fox News gave viewers information about why the disease is not a serious threat, while CNN provided a lot more information about the disease itself. Fox News covered racial issues âextensively but selectively about Biden and other Democratsï¿½?supposed positions on them and about outbreaks of violence at protests for racial justice in American citiesï¿½? The study found that CNN provided little information about either. The two networks also covered the issue of voting by mail, but again differed on the information provided about it in addition to offering different frames. A survey was conducted after three days on the participants, which captured significant shifts in beliefs. On Covid, viewers who switched were six percentage points more likely to believe other countries handled the virus better than the US, five points more likely to believe that people suffer from whats known as âlong Covidï¿½? and 11 points less likely to say a president should focus more on containing violent protests than the pandemic. On Mr Trump, there was a nearly three point decrease in the âfeeling thermometer ratingï¿½?after switching from Fox to CNN. On then-presidential candidate Mr Biden, switchers were 13 points less likely to agree that âweâll see many more police get shot by Black Lives Matter activistsï¿½?if he was elected and 10 points less likely to believe his supporters were happy when police officers get shot.  Biden news -live updates [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-news-latest-president-white-house-b2050221.html]  And on mail in voting, switchers were seven points more likely to support after watching CNN. âWe found large effects of watching CNN instead of Fox News on participantsï¿½?factual perceptions of current events (i.e., beliefs) and knowledge about the 2020 presidential candidatesï¿½?positions,ï¿½?the researchers said. âThey discovered changes in attitudes about Donald Trump and Republicans as well as a large effect on their opinions about Covid.ï¿½?The researchers concluded that this is an effect in part of âpartisan coverage filteringï¿½? wherein partisan outlets selectively report information, leading viewers to learn a biased set of facts. âConsistent with this, treated participants concluded that Fox concealed negative information about President Trump. Partisan media does not only present its side an electoral advantage ï¿½?it may present a challenge for democratic accountability,ï¿½?the study said."
453,0,Postcard from Dublin ï¿½?âThis is the most relaxing pubs have felt since before Covidï¿½?837 words,sundaytimes.co.uk,"It was the latest in a string of strict (some would say nonsensical) restrictions that weâve faced in Ireland since the pandemic began. But less than 24 hours after my early-bird dinner came the shock announcement[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/most-covid-restrictions-lifted-today-zbxdxf50r] that almost all the restrictions here were ending. No longer would we need to show vaccine certificates to enter any restaurant, cafÃ© or pub (as we had since July 2021); no longer would we need to socially distance or give our phone number to publicans for contact tracing, or abandon a half-drunk glass of wine at 7.55pm. It was all over. And Iâll be honest, it felt a little like a trap ï¿½?in the past weâve been eased out of each lockdown as slowly as a nervy kid dipping a toe into the swimming pool; this time we were flung into the deep end with barely any warning. The next day, January 22, people gathered to watch as the gaudy yellow stickers spread two metres apart were peeled off shopping-centre floors. Restaurants frantically tried to order enough food for new dinner bookings. By 8pm on Saturday the bars on the nightlife hub of Camden Street were swamped, with queues snaking around the block. The pavements became so jammed with people that it was easier to walk in the road. I wish I could tell you what it was like inside those bars, but I was at home in my pyjamas by 8.30pm. And I wasnât the only one ï¿½?the news that the restrictions were ending seemed to divide people, between the jubilant and those who have chosen to hibernate a little longer. After almost two years spent living in the dark, our eyes have to adjust to the light. Itâs the timing that sits a little oddly. Just two weeks previously we had recorded the highest number of daily new cases in Ireland (26,122 on January 8). Between Christmas and the new year we had more confirmed cases than in the whole of 2020; at one stage it became impossible to book a PCR test. To go from that to relative freedom in the space of a few weeks is more than a little jarring. Not that weâre complaining of course. For one thing it means that our pubs are finally back to normal. After the first lockdown they were allowed to open only for those eating a meal costing at least Â£8, with a time limit of 105 minutes on each table. Some were closed for 496 days because they didnât serve food and had to wait until the rules changed to allow in fully vaccinated punters. This is now the most relaxing that pubs have felt since before Covid. One of the greatest joys in an Irish pub is grabbing a stool at the bar for a sneaky afternoon pint while having a chat with the barman or reading the paper, but sitting at the bar has been off-limits since March 2020. When the lifting of restrictions was announced that Friday evening, it felt like Christmas Eve, knowing that the next morning weâd wake to a world free of (almost) all rules. Part of this freedom stems from our vaccine uptake ï¿½?94.5 per cent of adults are double-jabbed, while the figure for all those eligible, including children over the age of five, is 83 per cent. The booster jabs are in full swing too ï¿½?anyone over the age of 16 can get a booster and, at the time of writing, 66 per cent have done so. âHumans are social beings, and we Irish are more social than most,ï¿½?MicheÃ¡l Martin, the taoiseach, said in his January 21 address to the nation. âAs we look forward to this spring we need to see each other again. We need to see each other smile. We need to sing again.ï¿½?Martin said that he has never looked forward to a spring as much as this one. And I suppose I have to agree. Itâll be nice just to go for dinner without feeling like a kid on curfew, or to perch up at the bar for a quiet pint. I just hope that his statement doesnât lead to an epidemic of singsongs ï¿½?the nation has suffered enough.

238,1,SK Ecoplant's pre-IPO enjoys attention from wealthy individuals,450 words,The Korea Economic Daily Global Edition,"Its pre-IPO reached 800 billion won ($651.2 million), set to sell 600 billion won worth of newly issued convertible preferred stocks (CPS) and 200 billion won worth of shares owned by its chemical affiliate SK Discovery Co. The weighted average price per share is calculated as 94,700 won, and the corporate value after the pre-IPO is estimated to be 4 trillion won. Four Korean financial investors participated in the pre-IPO funding -- Premier Partners LLC will invest 280 billion won, Ium Private Equity and the consortium of Brain Asset Management Co. and NH Investment & Securities Co. each will inject 200 billion won, and Find Value Asset Management will put120 billion won. Find Value is understood to sell part of the 120 billion won project fund to retail investors and look for securities firms for the sales. The private fund will allow individualsï¿½?participation with a 300 million won or higher commitment per person. Deep-pocketed investors are hopeful for more than double their return after the IPO in the second half of 2023. The lead manager candidates estimate the corporate value at the timing of IPO as 8 trillion to 13 trillion won. The investors were also attracted by the pre-IPOâs stability as SK Ecoplant will gradually raise the CPSï¿½?dividend rate if it fails to go public in a certain period. Formerly SK E&C, SK Ecoplant was renamed in May 2021 as part of shifting its identity to an environmentally friendly company. It acquired Koreaâs largest waste treatment company EMC Holdings Co. [https://www.kedglobal.com/waste-management/newsView/ked202008190003] for 1 trillion won in 2020 and bought Singapore-based electronic waste disposal and recycling company TES-Envirocorp Pte [https://www.kedglobal.com/m-as/newsView/ked202202210008] for 1.2 trillion won in February of this year.

While certain of Quanta's operations were impacted by the pandemic and broader challenges in the energy market, the Company achieved many record financial results based on continued collaboration with customers, including record annual revenues, net income attributable to common stock and earnings per share. During 2021, the Company also accomplished key strategic objectives related to base business operations growth, workforce development and customer expansion. Notably, Quanta completed its largest acquisition to date by acquiring Blattner Holding Company (""Blattner""), a premier utility-scale renewable energy infrastructure solutions provider, which significantly expanded Quanta's service offerings with respect to the renewable energy market and ability to collaborate with customers on their energy-transition projects and long-term plans. The Company believes its performance and accomplishments are indicative of the resiliency and sustainability of its business model. Additionally, as a result of the Company's ability to perform notwithstanding the difficult circumstances, the Compensation Committee, as supported by the Company's Chief Executive Officer (""CEO""), did not make any adjustments in 2021 directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Quanta's strong performance during 2021 resulted in a payout under the 2021 annual incentive plan at approximately 165.9% of target and the completion of an exceptional 2019-2021 performance cycle that resulted in performance exceeding the maximum performance goals set under the 2019 long-term incentive plan. Additionally, the performance targets and metrics utilized in the Company's 2021 long-term incentive plan, which apply to the 2021-2023 performance cycle, continue to represent improvement over prior performance and/or targets and support Quanta's strategic initiatives with respect to return on invested capital, efficient and sustainable usage of property and equipment and employee safety. 2021 Target Compensation Mix  Quanta's named executive officer (""NEO"") compensation is primarily comprised of base salary, short-term cash incentives and long-term equity incentives. Target award levels generally reflect competitive market levels and practices, with upside opportunity for performance above target levels, and performance measures are chosen to align the interests of executives with stockholders. iv Table of Contents PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan Equity Mix A significant portion of equity-based incentive awards (70% with respect to the CEO and 60% with respect to other NEOs) are tied to measurable Company performance over a 3-year performance period. Elements of Executive Compensation Element and Form of Compensation Performance / Payment Criteria Purpose Base Salary Cash Individual performance and experience in the role are factors To provide fixed compensation necessary to attract and retain key executives, and offset the cyclicality in our business that may impact variable pay Short-Term Incentive Cash Tied to the achievement of performance targets related to (i) AIP Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below); (ii) AIP Adjusted EBITDA margin (as defined below); and (iii) safety performance To incentivize and reward achievement of annual financial and operational performance targets, which focus on profitable growth and safe execution Long-Term Incentive Performance Stock Units (""PSUs"") Cliff-vest at the end of a 3-year performance period Tied to the achievement of return on invested capital, relative total stockholder return, capital efficiency and certain sustainability-based metrics (i.e., fleet idle time and composite driver safety) To incentivize achievement of our long-term financial performance targets that focus on strategic initiatives To align management and stockholder interests and to attract and promote retention of key executives To incentivize sustainable performance through reduced environmental impact and enhanced employee safety Restricted Stock Units (""RSUs"") Vest over three years in equal annual installments To align management and stockholder interests and attract and promote retention of key executives Other Compensation Retirement Benefits and Perquisites Not applicable To maintain the health and safety of executives To provide a competitive compensation package and, in certain cases, optimize key executives' time v Table of Contents PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY Compensation Governance We are committed to strong governance standards that ensure our executive compensation programs are closely aligned with the interests of our stockholders and other stakeholders, as evidenced by the policies and practices described below. What We Do ï¿½?Stock Ownership Guidelines. We maintain meaningful stock ownership guidelines that align our executives' long-term interests with those of our stockholders and discourage excessive risk-taking. ï¿½?Clawback Policy. We maintain a clawback policy that permits our Board to recover from executive officers and key employees of Quanta and its subsidiaries cash or equity incentive compensation in certain circumstances involving a restatement of the Company's financial statements. ï¿½?Annual Review. Our Compensation Committee engages its own independent compensation consultant, which performs an annual comprehensive market analysis of our executive compensation program and pay levels. ï¿½?Annual Say-on-Pay Vote. We provide our stockholders with an annual opportunity to participate in an advisory vote on NEO compensation. ï¿½?Performance-Based Compensation. The majority of the target compensation for our NEOs is subject to objective and measurable financial and operational performance metrics. ï¿½?Performance Thresholds and Maximums. All performance- based awards require that the Company achieve a threshold level of performance to receive any award and provide for a cap on the maximum award in the event the established performance criteria is dramatically exceeded. ï¿½?Modest Perquisites. Our NEOs receive a modest amount of perquisites, which are intended to promote wellness, provide convenience in light of the demands of their positions, assist them in serving necessary business purposes, and provide a competitive compensation package. ï¿½?Sustainability Performance Metrics. Both short-term cash incentive compensation and long-term equity incentive compensation for NEOs are tied to successful performance of sustainability initiatives, including employee safety measures and efficient utilization of equipment. What We Don't Do X Anti-Pledging Policy. We maintain an anti-pledging policy that prohibits directors and executive officers from pledging Quanta securities as collateral for a loan absent pre-clearance and demonstration of financial capacity to repay without resorting to the pledged securities. X Anti-Hedging Policy. We maintain an anti-hedging policy that prohibits directors and executive officers from hedging the economic risk of ownership of Quanta common stock. X No Gross-Up.Our employment agreements with NEOs do not provide for gross-ups of excise taxes on severance or other payments in connection with a change of control. Proposal 3: Ratification of the Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Quanta's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2022. u See page 66 for further information vi Table of Contents PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY Proposal 4: Approval of Amendment to Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR approval of the amendment to the Quanta Services, Inc. 2019 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the ""2019 Omnibus Plan""). u See page 69for further information Summary of Amendment Stockholders are being asked to approve an amendment to the 2019 Omnibus Plan. The 2019 Omnibus Plan was approved by the Board on March 21, 2019 and by Quanta's stockholders on May 23, 2019. On March 30, 2022, the Board approved Amendment No. 1 to the 2019 Omnibus Plan, subject to stockholder approval, which increases the number of shares of Quanta common stock that may be issued thereunder by 2,173,000 shares and clarifies that dividends and dividend equivalents granted in tandem with any award under the 2019 Omnibus Plan will not be paid unless and until such award vests and the restrictions on such award lapse (the ""Amendment"").  Quanta's Grant Practices and Use of Equity-Based Compensation ï¿½?Motivation and Alignment of Interests. Quanta utilizes equity-based compensation to attract, retain and incentivize key personnel and believes that such equity-based compensation has been integral to Quanta's success in the past and will be important for continued strong performance. ï¿½?Broad-Based Grant Practices. Quanta grants equity-based compensation to management and key operations personnel at the majority of our operating companies and has awarded equity-based incentive compensation to approximately 2,500 individuals on an annual average basis over the last three fiscal years. Approximately 79% of the equity-based compensation awards under the 2019 Omnibus Plan have been granted to employees that are not executive officers or directors of Quanta. We believe these broad-based grants help align incentives throughout the organization, which is key given our decentralized structure. ï¿½?Strategic Grant Practices. Quanta has historically utilized strategic acquisitions as a key component of our strategic plan, including to broaden our customer base, expand its geographic area of operations, grow our portfolio of services and increase opportunities across the organization. Granting equity-based compensation awards to key personnel of an acquired business helps foster retention and an ownership culture and align incentives throughout Quanta's decentralized structure. Since May 2019, when the 2019 Omnibus Plan was adopted, Quanta has granted equity-based compensation awards covering approximately 1.3 million shares to key employees of acquired businesses in connection with the closing of strategic acquisitions. ï¿½?Stock Repurchases Offset Dilution. Quanta repurchased approximately 7.8 million shares of Quanta common stock from 2019 through 2021, which has provided a significant return of capital to investors and offset the dilutive effect of shares underlying equity-based compensation awards granted during 2019, 2020 and 2021. ï¿½?Reasonable Share Request. Quanta believes that the increase to the number of shares of Quanta common stock available for issuance under the 2019 Omnibus Plan, together with the remaining shares currently available for issuance under the 2019 Omnibus Plan, would be sufficient for equity compensation awards over approximately the next three years, and that such a request is reasonable and consistent with general market practices. ï¿½?Impact of Insufficient Shares. If stockholders do not approve the Amendment, we expect that we will have an insufficient number of shares available to make equity-based compensation a meaningful part of our employees' overall compensation in the future, requiring us to consider providing additional cash awards or remuneration in order to maintain competitive levels of compensation. We believe that outcome could negatively impact our ability to align employee compensation with the interests of our stockholders. vii Table of Contents PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY 2019 Omnibus Plan Best Practices The 2019 Omnibus Plan includes features designed to protect stockholder interests and reflect our compensation and governance principles, as described below. ï¿½?One-Year Minimum Vesting Requirement. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the 2019 Omnibus Plan requires future equity awards to have minimum vesting periods of not less than one year from the date an award is granted. ï¿½?No Payment of Dividends on Unvested Awards. As further clarified by the Amendment, payment of dividends and dividend equivalents on shares underlying unvested awards is expressly prohibited until awards vest or restrictions lapse, such that declared dividends and dividend equivalents are subject to forfeiture until such vesting and/or lapsing. ï¿½?Director Compensation Limit. Awards under the 2019 Omnibus Plan and all other compensation payable to each non-employee director is subject to an aggregate limit of $500,000 per year, provided that a newly elected director may receive up to $750,000 for his or her initial calendar year of service on the Board and a director serving as Chairman of the Board or Lead Director may receive up to $750,000 per calendar year. ï¿½?No Liberal Share Recycling. Shares tendered or withheld to cover taxes or pay the exercise of an award are not again available for grant under the 2019 Omnibus Plan. ï¿½?Clawback Policy. Incentive compensation is subject to recoupment as required by law or pursuant to the Company's clawback policy (as described in further detail in Compensation Discussion& Analysis - Clawback Policy), or if the Board determines that a participant has violated applicable restrictive covenants. ï¿½?No Discounted Options or Stock Appreciation Rights. Options and stock appreciation rights must have an exercise price or base price at or above the fair market value per share of Quanta common stock on the date of grant. ï¿½?Prohibition on Repricing. Repricing of stock options and stock appreciation rights without the approval of our stockholders is expressly prohibited. ï¿½?No Liberal Change in Control Definition. The 2019 Omnibus Plan does not include a ""liberal"" change in control definition (i.e., mergers require actual consummation). ï¿½?No Excise Tax Gross-Ups.A default ""best-net"" parachute payment provision states that either parachute payments will be reduced to avoid excise taxes or a participant will receive the full benefit and pay the related excise taxes, whichever results in the better after-tax result for the participant. ï¿½?Transfer Restrictions. The 2019 Omnibus Plan includes robust transfer restrictions, including that no award may be transferred to a third-party financial institution for value. ï¿½?Fixed Term and Fixed Share Authorization. The 2019 Omnibus Plan has a term of ten years and does not have an ""evergreen"" feature (i.e., the amount of shares authorized is fixed and can only be increased with stockholder approval). viii Table of Contents TABLE OF CONTENTS Board Recommendation âX PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY i QUANTA BOARD OF DIRECTORS 2 âProposal 1: Election of Directors 2 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 9 Board Leadership Structure 9 The Board's Role in Strategy 10 The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 10 Board Independence 11 Executive Sessions ofNon-ManagementDirectors 12 Director Meetings 12 Committees of the Board 13 Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 15 Code of Conduct 15 Engagement and Communications with the Board 15 Board and Committee Evaluations 17 Identifying and Evaluating Nominees for Director 17 Director Qualifications 18 Director Compensation 18 2021 Director Compensation Table 21 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 22 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 24 Compensation Committee Report 24 Executive Summary 24 Compensation Philosophy 29 Elements of Executive Compensation 30 Executive Compensation Decisions for 2021 31 Stock Ownership Guidelines 42 Pledging, Hedging and Other Transactions in QuantaSecurities 43 Clawback Policy 43 Employment Agreements 44 Indemnification Agreements 44 Risk Considerations in Our Compensation Program 44 Compensation Process 45 Impact of Regulatory Requirements on Our Executive Compensation Decisions 46 Conclusion 47 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 48 2021 Compensation Tables 48 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in 2021 54 Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 56 Estimated Potential Payments 60 Equity Compensation Plan Information 62 Chief Executive Officer Pay Ratio 63 ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 64 âProposal 2: Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation 64 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR 66 âProposal 3: Ratification of the Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 66 Audit Committee Report 67 Audit Fees 68 AMENDMENT TO OMNIBUS EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN 69 âProposal 4: Approval of Amendment to the Quanta Services, Inc. 2019 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan 69 Outstanding Full-Value Awards and Shares Available 71 Summary of 2019 Omnibus Plan 71 Plan Benefits 75 SECURITY OWNERSHIP 77 Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners 77 Security Ownership of Management 78 Employee, Officer and Director Hedging 79 CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS 80 Related Party Transactions 80 Review of Related Party Transactions 80 Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports 81 GENERAL INFORMATION 82 Questions and Answers About the Annual Meeting 82 Stockholder Proposals and Nominations of Directors for the 2023 Annual Meeting 86 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 87 Other Matters 87 APPENDIX A - RECONCILIATION OFNON-GAAPFINANCIAL MEASURES A-1 APPENDIX B - AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO QUANTA SERVICES, INC. 2019 OMNIBUS EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN B-1 APPENDIX C - QUANTA SERVICES, INC. 2019 OMNIBUS EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN C-1 Table of Contents QUANTA BOARD OF DIRECTORS Proposal 1: Election of Directors The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the election of each of the director nominees.

550,0,Dutch cultural sector protests pandemic lockdown measures,472 words,Associated Press Newswires,"The tough Dutch lockdown is running into increasing anger from businesses hit by the restrictions. Last week and over the weekend hundreds of Dutch bars and restaurants also opened their doors as a protest against the lockdown they say is crippling their businesses. On Wednesday it was the turn of the cultural sector, who turned themselves into businesses such as hairdressers or nail salons to press home their demand to reopen. âWe do not understand and there is no reasoning for it because we have shown over the last two years that itâs very, very safe to go to a concert or to go to a museum,ï¿½?said Simon Reinink, director of Amsterdamâs Concertgebouw concert hall. âActually, itâs our profession ï¿½?crowd management. We know how to deal with large crowds. And weâve done it in a very, very safe way,ï¿½?Reinink added. The resident orchestra, conducted by Susanna MÃ¤lkki, played American composer Charles Ives' Symphony Number 2, while two hairdressers cut hair in the historic venue. Across the street at the Van Gogh Museum, a barber cut the hair of 10 visitors and 10 more people got a nail treatment. âItâs definitely a first for us at the Van Gogh Museum,"" the museum's director, Emilie Gordenker, told The Associated Press. âI understand that the government has opened gyms but ... you need a mental gym, too, and a museum is a place where people are increasingly coming to find a little depth or reason for their life,"" she added. ""And the theme of mental health is particularly relevant to our museum, obviously, because of Vincent van Goghâs own mental situation.ï¿½?The government has said it will look at possible further easing Jan. 25. While omicron has sent infection rates soaring to levels never earlier seen during the pandemic, hospital admissions continue to decline. Culture Minister Gunay Uslu said in a tweet: âI understand the cry for help and that artists want to show all the beautiful things they have to offer us. But the opening of society must go step by step. Culture is high on the agenda.ï¿½?___ Follow APâs pandemic coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic[https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic]"

The approval for Aquila Acquisition Corp[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3163778/spac-backed-chinese-brokerage-cmb-international-becomes], sponsored by the asset management arm of Chinese brokerage CMB International, was reflected in an updated draft prospectus published on website of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) on Wednesday. While the company did not say how much it plans to raise from the share sale, SPACs in Hong Kong must raise a minimum of HK$1 billion (US$128 million).

Green Tea Group, a Chinese restaurant chain operator with 236 outlets nationwide, also received a nod from the cityâs bourse operator for its IPO. The firm aims to raise between US$100 million and US$200 million, a source familiar with the transaction said. These companies are pressing ahead with their IPO plans despite concerns over the global economy following Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, which has roiled equities and commodities markets. The price of crude, which has risen to the highest level since 2008, has fuelled fears of a global recession, sending the Hang Seng Index[https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3169772/hong-kong-stocks-slide-approaching-six-year-low-energy] towards a six-year low.

Aquila Acquisition, which is led by CMB International Asset Management along with several executive directors and senior management, said it planned to use the IPO proceeds to buy companies in the ânew economy sectorï¿½? âOur objective is to generate attractive returns for the shareholders by selecting a high-quality [acquisition] target,ï¿½?it said in the prospectus.  Aquila also said that CMB International has invested in over 100 Chinese technology companies, many of which have gone on to launch their own stock offerings. These include Chinaâs super app Meituan and electric-car battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology.  Morgan Stanley and CMB International are the joint sponsors of the SPAC deal. Green Tea Group, which claims to be the fourth-largest casual Chinese dining chain, plans to open up to 100 new restaurants between 2022 and 2024, according to its draft prospectus. It also plans to use part of the IPO proceeds to upgrade its information technology network.  Citigroup and CMB International are joint sponsors of the deal. The group earned 94.9 million yuan (US$15 million) of profit in the nine months to September 2021, compared with a net loss of 30.7 million yuan in the same period a year earlier. So far this year, only eight companies have completed IPOs in Hong Kong, raising US$1.3 billion, versus US$10.1 billion in the same period a year ago from 23 deals, data from Refinitiv shows.

943,0,Genting blames German state for shipbuilder's collapse,321 words,Agence France Presse,"The company took the state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania to court in December for the payment of $88 million (78 million euros). The money Genting HK claimed dates back to an agreement with the government in June to provide a bridging loan for the struggling dockyard operation on the Baltic coast. A ruling in the case is expected shortly. According to Genting, the state linked the payment to conditions that were not in the original contract, including increasing Genting's own contribution to the rescue package from 30 million to 60 million euros. Lawyers representing Mecklenburg-West Pomerania rejected the suggestion the state had a political motivation, saying it was required under its budget law to closely examine the loans it made. The state also said that the June agreement extended a credit line of up to 148 million euros, while the shipbuilder's funding gap had risen to 600 million euros. The shipbuilder MV Werften, which employs around 2,000 people across three dockyards, filed for bankruptcy on Monday after failing to secure funding for the completion of the ""Global One"" cruise ship. Until recently the company was engaged in negotiations with stated and federal government to try and reach an agreement on a financial support package to finish the mega-liner, 80 percent built up to now. Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Monday that the government had ""pulled out all the stops"" to avoid MV Werften filing for bankruptcy. sea/hmn/lth"

123,1,Elon Muskâs pursuit of Twitter will destroy Tesla,1084 words,The Telegraph Online,"Even if he faces furious opposition from the company itself, from other media giants, and from its own over-excitable user-baser, there are plenty of reasons for Elon Musk to buy Twitter. A few of them even make sense. Yet in business, as in most of lifeâs endeavours, there is always a downside as well. Musk's pursuit of Twitter[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/04/14/elon-musk-offers-buy-twitter-43bn/] will end up destroying his greatest creation, Tesla. It will be hugely contentious, at a time when the emerging electric car giant still needs lots of attention. It will alienate its core user base, and that will spread to every product he is involved with-and it will turn Musk into a politically contentious figure, exposing Tesla to intense regulatory scrutiny. In truth, the bid has now thrown the vast market for electric vehicles wide open, and may hand it to rivals such as Ford, Volkswagen or even Apple. It was obvious from the moment he turned down a seat on its board that Musk was planning to launch a full-scale bid for Twitter. There was never much point in just owning 9pc, his initial stake[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/04/04/twitter-shares-soar-elon-musk-takes-29bn-stake/], and Musk is not the kind of character to be a passive shareholder. We will find out in the next few weeks how that plays out. It promises to be an epic battle. Musk has already argued that he is fighting to âdefend democracyï¿½?and âprotect the future of civilisationï¿½? Twitter, led by chief executive Parag Agrawal, has already indicated it will reject the offer. I made an offer https://t.co/VvreuPMeLu[https://t.co/VvreuPMeLu]  It has rallied the support of other major shareholder such as Saudi Arabiaâs Prince Alwaleed bin Talal (possibly not the best ally if it the contest turns on who is âdefending democracyï¿½?since the Saudis have never been especially keen on the idea), and may well adopt a poison pill defence to protect its independence. It promises to be nail-biting for the participants, and a lot of fun for the rest of us. There is a problem, however, and it is far from a minor one. Tesla may well be a casualty of the battle. Taking control of Twitter will be hugely contentious. The company is not going to go down without a fight. To win control, Musk will have to spend the next few months locked up with his bankers, lawyers and PR campaigners figuring out how to win over the shareholders. It is not just that it will be expensive ï¿½?the $40bn or so it will end up costing wonât make a massive dent in his estimated $240bn fortune even though he will have to sell some Tesla shares to fund it ï¿½?it will also be very time-consuming. At a time when Tesla should be seizing the opportunity gifted to it by a soaring oil price, and an energy crisis, to drive home its dominance of the electric vehicle industry its founder is distracting himself with a quixotic pursuit of what is, comparatively, a minor business. It is hard to believe that Tesla is not going to suffer from that. Every company needs someone in charge, and Musk is going to be absent for months. Next, Twitter is a fiercely controversial space. The technical term in clinical psychology for its average user is âbatsh!&t crazyï¿½? Most social media might be pernicious, but they are also relatively harmless.  Facebook is mainly used to keep up with friends and families, Instagram to post pictures of what everyone is having for brunch, Snapchat for teens to flirt nervously with each other, and WhatsApp to text your Mum.  Twitter is the place where the world congregates for bitter political fights. It is characterised by a hysterical form of left-wing virtue signalling [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/04/11/ridding-twitter-left-wing-bias-could-elon-musks-finest-achievement/]where anyone mildly to the right of Lenin is dismissed as a Nazi. Most of these âtopï¿½?accounts tweet rarely and post very little content. Is Twitter dying? https://t.co/lj9rRXfDHE[https://t.co/lj9rRXfDHE]  Sure, it is commendable for Musk to try and fix that. But there is no point in pretending it wonât affect Tesla. Everyone angry with him will be angry with the car maker as well. And that will hurt. Finally, it is going to turn Musk into a politically contentious figure. It might be hypocritical, but other media organisations will be out to get him. So will political leaders. Musk is perfectly right that the site has become a left-wing echo chamber that has worsened public debate, but clearing that up is going to be hugely controversial. The result? Tesla is now likely to be subjected to a lot more regulatory scrutiny. Is it really that green, once you figure out the impact of all the raw materials that go into making it? Should it get a share of all the tax subsidies doled out for EVs now it is so well-established? Should its new factories, such as the huge new Berlin plant, still get government grants? Those questions will all be open to debate in a way they were not before. In reality, the electric vehicle market is still wide open. Tesla has made all the early running, and has the best brand in the industry. Its best-selling models are dominating the sales charts and production is ramping up to meet the demand. And yet the competition is turning more intense. Ford has quietly built up a range of technologies and new models that will be a real challenge. Volkswagen is investing billions in its own line of battery powered cars. In the background, Apple is ready to pounce, and an i-Car would be every bit as attractive as a Tesla. True, great entrepreneurs often veer off in new directions. Jeff Bezos has purchased the Washington Post and most of the Premier League is owned by one billionaire or another. But typically that is only when their main creation is very well established. In reality, the Twitter offer may mark the end of Teslaâs glorious run. And other companies can now muscle into a fast-developing market."
585,0,"Crown, Blackstone hopeful of approval for $8.9b deal",518 words,The Age,"""There are a few things that need to be done in terms of finalising our probity, but it's mostly done, and I'd have to say we haven't found anything that is going to be a bar to them proceeding,"" he said. Sources close to Crown and Blackstone are also confident regulators in Victoria, NSW and WA will support the transaction and give Blackstone approval to take up Crown's casino licences. Former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett, who spearheaded Crown casino's opening in the 1990s, said he would ""like nothing more"" than for Crown to be in the hands of new owners with the experience and reputation for governance needed to run it. ""For more than 20 years it has been an icon of quality and our largest single-site employer. I could think of nothing more important than for it to find security through an owner that can with experience provide consistently good governance."" Blackstone is hoping to secure the approval to have the deal completed mid-year. The James Packer-controlled Crown has come under scrutiny amid revelations of serious governance breaches including that some of its customers were engaged in criminal activity such as money laundering. Crown has faced inquiries in all three states where it operates. NSW stripped Crown of its prized licence for Barangaroo in late 2020 following the Bergin Inquiry. A Victorian royal commission into Crown's Melbourne casino led by retired judge Ray Finkelstein, QC, found Crown was unfit to run its flagship property but decided not to recommend cancelling its licence, and instead gave it two years to reform itself. Blackstone has also faced questions about its appropriateness amid concerns about the governance of its casino businesses in Latin America and Las Vegas. Blackstone - spearheaded by local dealmaker Chris Tynan - lobbed its fourth takeover offer for Crown Resorts this week, raising the offer to $13.10 a share. Blackstone's newest offer has already gained the approval of the casino's board and the attention of billionaire majority shareholder Mr Packer, who said he was ""encouraged"". A binding offer from Blackstone is needed before regulators make a final call. A person close to Blackstone who could not speak publicly said the private equity firm had done all it could to win over regulators, and did not believe it would struggle to win the approval of the Foreign Investment Review Board which is required for the deal's completion. Crown's chairman, Ziggy Switkowski, said things were ""working well""."

173,0,McDonald's to shut down in Russia,702 words,The Daily Telegraph,"The news comes as Russia suspended the sale of foreign currencies until September, meaning that citizens will not be able to buy them in local banks. They will, however, be able to change foreign currencies into the local ruble unit. Meanwhile, Fitch downgraded its rating of Russia to ""C"", indicating that the rating agency believes a sovereign default is imminent.  McDonald's said it was temporarily closing 850 outlets because it ""cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine"", while Starbucks is both shuttering cafes and suspending shipments. It comes after Britain, the US and the EU set out plans to ditch Russian oil and gas in a move which President Joe Biden said was aimed at ""targeting the main artery of Russia's economy"". President Biden added: ""Americans have rallied to support the Ukrainian people and made it clear we will not be part of subsidising Putin's war.""  McDonald's opened its first restaurant in Moscow in 1990, attracting queues of an estimated 30,000 people in Pushkin Square in what came to be seen as a defining moment for the triumph of capitalism after the Cold War. The company's success gave rise to Thomas Friedman's Golden Arches theory, in which he suggested that con sumerism was a force for peace because no two countries that both had the chain's restaurants had ever fought a war against each other.  Chris Kempczinski , the chief executive of McDonald's , wrote to employees to say the business was facing an ""extraordinarily challenging"" situation.  McDonald's employs 62,000 people in Russia, works with hundreds of local suppliers and serves millions of customers every day. Around 9pc of the business's revenues come from Russia and Ukraine, equal to about $2bn (Â£1.5bn). However, Mr Kempczinski said it was a case of ""doing the right thing"", and so McDonald's was pausing all operations in Russia. He said: ""The conflict in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis in Europe has caused unspeakable suffering to innocent people We join the world in condemning aggression and violence and praying for peace."" Clive Black , a director at Shore Capital , said the closure would likely bring the impact of sanctions home to ordinary Russians. He said: ""It's one thing when there are external things happening around banking and oil, but it's another thing when 850 restaurants close down. It's a very clear symbol that something is changing which is quite material. ""In isolation, it wouldn't necessarily be the end of the world, but we saw how popular McDonald's was in the UK when Covid controls ended, and I'd imagine it was the same in Russia. ""This is a very big statement, and along with everything else will turn up the pressure [among the public] that what's going on isn't normal and maybe the narrative needs to be questioned.""  McDonald's said it will continue to pay all its employees in Russia, despite the restaurants being shut. It is impossible to predict when they will reopen, the business said. The step follows a mounting public backlash against the brand, with customers over the weekend vowing to boycott the chain if it continued to sell in Russia. It came as Kwasi Kwarteng , the Business Secretary, announced that Britain would ban Russian oil imports by the end of 2022, and President Joe Biden signed an executive order blocking imports of Russian oil, coal and gas. Moments before their announcements, the European Commission published plans to try to cut EU demand for Russian gas by two thirds before the end of the year, and make Europe ""independent from Russian fossil fuels well before 2030"".

412,0,"As Olympic torch is lit in hope, I see light at end of the tunnel",790 words,The Herald,"When Ivy League universities in America are closing their doors and sending students home until August, donât rule out the first cancellation of an Olympic Games since World War II.? The IOC and host nation Japan are still confident that the Games will go ahead as planned, but no one has any real idea on how long this might go on for. Just from athletes I have spoken to, there is definitely real concern over the Games. The concern isnât just over whether the games get cancelled or not. For each individual athlete, it is also over their own preparations. As an athlete, getting sick is never great and if you got this virus bad you might face missing weeks of training. It could result on you missing the podium in Tokyo.? Or missing the Games altogether. Another friend of mine told me of his concerns that if they move the Games then he might not even get selected.? With markets crashing and supermarket shelves being cleared, these are definitely interesting times for everybody. But when you are living during this Covid-19 pandemic with a spinal-cord injury I guess it becomes even more daunting ï¿½?as such an injury can remove your cough and sneeze reflex. With very little core function, the thought of not being able to cough is a pretty scary proposition.? This might not sound too bad. But this virus hits elderly people hard ï¿½?and this also includes your biological age due to underlying medical conditions. So this is a scary time, and I completely feel for everyone in the same boat as me how scary this is.?I remember back to catching the flu in November last year ï¿½?I thought I was going to stop breathing. I couldnât cough to clear my lungs as the level of my injury is right at the nerves which go to the lungs.? It knocked me out for weeks, so I would be lying if I said I wasnât slightly scared of Covid-19 and its possible effects on my lungs.? I am a very optimistic person who always looks for solutions over problems. But I must admit this has got me a little bit shaken.? Watching whatâs happening in Italy has been hard to believe ï¿½?particularly as life seemed to be continuing almost as normal here.? I looked at the MRI of a 44-year-old manâs lungs and it was unbelievable, unfortunately he didnât survive.? So I am staying positive but also taking advice from Austrian neurologist Viktor Frankl.?He speaks of acceptance of your current situation. These are his own words ï¿½?which I have had on my wall for the last four years: âThe meaning of life lies in finding a purpose and taking responsibility for ourselves and other human beings.ï¿½? In other words, by having a clear âwhyï¿½?we can face all the âhowï¿½?questions of life. This has got me through all those hours in hospital and continues to serve me daily.? Thereâs a reason that in-flight safety presentations always instruct us to secure our own oxygen masks before assisting fellow passengers. We canât help others effectively unless we first protect ourselves. So I spoke with a medical oncologist friend and they advised me to self-isolate.? I am now on day four and thinking this could be a long road ahead; thankfully the weather is getting warmer and I got out on my bike for a few laps of Richmond Park. Along with indoor turbo sessions I am well prepared mentally for the process. I guess all my time in hospital equipped my mind to deal with self-isolating. It also probably helps being an introvert.? I canât help but think of the poor people undergoing their cancer treatment right now though, as I prepare for my own hospital appointment in a few weeks, but I am grateful that side of things is under control. My main goal is keeping my immune system strong because another issue I have from my spinal-cord injury is a compromised immune system, thus moving me into a vulnerable group.? Itâs hard to go from a strong athlete to now feeling so vulnerable, but thankfully I have a strong mind."
186,1,Leveraging social media to boost offline sales,635 words,The Times of India - Mumbai Edition,"Charath Narsimhan, managing director of a clothing brand, recollects an incident a couple of years ago, when a popular singer picked up a few clothes from their store and wore it as a part of his ensemble during a show. ""All we did was to tag our clothes in social media posts. As he made it look so appealing, we found that those clothes and similar outfits, moved exceedingly well in terms of sales,"" he says. More and more brands have been resorting to reaching out to youngsters by way of digital marketing tools. Today, with people spending a significant amount of time on their phones and devices, this mode of marketing is proving to be an important route to reach consumers. PROMOTIONAL CONTENT Marketing by way of social media in relation to fashion and apparel works in different ways. Through videos on social media platforms, brands can showcase their garments while getting content creators to wear them, share their styling tips and so on. This helps brands to display their latest collections to a wider audience and thereby improve sales. This is perhaps why many brands are exploring this medium alongside traditional advertising to convey a diverse range of products- from apparel to accessories, appliances, skincare and more-to customers. And it isn't just the products that are showcased, useful tips, user guides and insights too are presented, so as to allow consumers to get more information about the products. SOCIAL MEDIA IMPACT A survey by a marketing company found that 56 per cent of its respondents made a purchase based on posts they saw on social media. Sixtythree per cent of them said they found the content on such mediums to be more compelling than other tools. Rehana Basheer, a boutique owner, feels that customers are receptive to content they view on websites and social media platforms. She says, ""Customers trust the look of the garment they see on a social media site."" She also feels that customers find it to be realistic and relatable. Many brands including top couture design- ers, feel that this kind of marketing strategy can massively boost a brand's reputation and sales. ON THE FLIP SIDE Despite this, brands are already seeing the flip side of social media marketing. ""Advertising through social media could sway the audience considerably until a couple of years ago. Of late, consumers are finding this kind of marketing to be too commercial,"" says Narsimhan. ""Brands should be wary of overcommercialisation, as it takes away the authenticity,"" shares Narsimhan. Amritha Ram, a styl- ist, however, finds social media marketing in India, still in its nascent stages compared to the west. She says, ""Brands need to adopt an organic approach and a well-thought-out strategy. Content creators too, should work on gaining more knowledge of the products which will breathe life into the posts they share."" In this manner, brands need to adopt a balanced approach that includes a mix of digital and traditional forms of marketing to reach their audiences faster and offer more relevant information and insights that are valued by consumers today. And with consumers and their needs evolving rapidly, this medium of marketing, when clubbed with more traditional forms of marketing, is only set to grow and become more important in the days to come."

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended February 28, 2022 Net sales for the three months ended February 28, 2022 increased by 28.9% to $10.5 million, as compared to net sales of $8.2 million for the three months ended February 28, 2021. The increase in net sales for the three-month period is primarily attributable to an increase in business with new customers as well as an increase in business with existing customers. Gross profit for the three months ended February 28, 2022 increased by 28.8% to $3.0 million, as compared to $2.3 million for the three months ended February 28, 2021. Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales remained flat at 28.2% for the three months ended February 28, 2022, as compared to the three months ended February 28, 2021. We attribute the increase in gross profit to an increase in sales volume in the three months ended February 28, 2022. Our industry will continue to receive pressure from customers for price reductions. Selling and shipping expenses for the three months ended February 28, 2022 increased 2.9% to $700,978, as compared to $681,132 for the three months ended February 28, 2021. We attribute the increase to an increase in commissions, auto and entertainment expenses, and offset by a decrease in salesman payroll and freight out costs. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended February 28, 2022 increased 4.6% to $1.3 million, as compared to $1.2 million for three months ended February 28, 2021. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to increases in rent, temporary help and general insurance expenses, professional fees as well as salaries and related payroll taxes, directors fees and public company expenses, offset by decreases in settlement expenses due to a settlement with a customer in the three months ended February 28, 2021. Net income for the three months ended February 28, 2022 was $671,753, as compared to net income of $277,664 for the three months ended February 28, 2021.

451,1,Guess Which Generation Wants Sustainable Clothes the Most?,1212 words,Sourcing Journal,"While younger consumers are more concerned about sustainability, theyâre not alone. First Insight partnered with the Baker Retailing Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania on a consumer sustainability report. It found that âa profound sustainability knowledge gap existsï¿½?between the nationâs top retail executives and consumers. This, writes First Insightâs Gretchen Jezerc, senior vice president of marketing, âpresents opportunities for retailers not only to bolster their reputations and enhance consumer loyalty, but also to increase profits.ï¿½?The First Insight/Baker Retailing Center report found two-thirds of consumers say they would pay more for sustainable products, while two-thirds of retailers believe consumers would not be willing to do so. It also found nearly three-quarters of consumers value product sustainability over brand name. Ironically, 94 percent of retailers believe the opposite, saying brand name would be more important to consumers. âThis report clearly demonstrates that retailers are leaving money on the table,ï¿½?states First Insightâs Greg Petro, CEO. âBrands and retailers must listen to the voice of the customer on issues as critical as sustainability. Consumers want more than performative measures from retailers and brands when it comes to ESG (environmental, social and governance) priorities, which will only become more important as Gen Z grows in influence.ï¿½?In apparel, natural fibers are inherently perceived as more sustainable than synthetics, according to the Cotton Council International (CCI) and Cotton Incorporated 2021 Global Sustainability Study. The data shows âmade with natural fibers like cottonï¿½?is a top consideration (43 percent) when consumers are determining the sustainability/environmental friendliness of an apparel item. Boomers are most likely to feel that way (56 percent), followed by Gen X (49 percent), Millennials (37 percent), and Gen Z (34 percent). Most consumers (72 percent) are likely to look for apparel that is made from natural fibers such as cotton, wool, silk, etc., according to U.S. Sustainability Research. Boomers (80 percent) are especially likely to look for clothes made of natural fibers. Theyâre followed by Gen X (75 percent), Millennials (70 percent), and Gen Z (63 percent). Not only are consumers seeking natural fibers, theyâre going out of their way to actively avoid certain textiles. About two-thirds of all consumers (64 percent) check the fiber content label before purchasing a garment to eschew clothes made from rayon, according to the U.S. Sustainability Research. Fibers such as viscose, lyocell, and modal are manmade fibers that start out as trees, and are then processed and chemically converted into rayon fibers. Every year, more than 120 million trees are cut down to produce rayon fiber. Concern about deforestation issues caused by rayon production (78 percent) is the number one fiber production related issue among consumers, especially among Gen X (83 percent). Theyâre followed by Millennials (81 percent), Gen Z (70 percent), and Boomers (56 percent, according to the U.S. Sustainability Research.). While consumers say they prefer to avoid synthetics, just 29 percent say they regularly buy clothes made from sustainable, environmentally friendly, or natural materials, according to the U.S. Sustainability Research. Millennials (39 percent) made the biggest effort to buy eco-friendly clothes, followed by Boomers (27 percent), Gen X (24 percent), and Gen Z (21 percent). But the dichotomy between what shoppers say they want to buy and what they end of purchasing may likely be due to a couple of factors: where they shop and the most popular type of fabrics used by todayâs apparel brands. The top stores for clothes shopping are mass merchants like Target and Walmart (23 percent), according to the Cotton Incorporated Lifestyle Monitor Survey. That includes 19 percent of those aged 13-to-34 and 26 percent of those aged 35-to-70. Fast fashion stores like Zara, H&M, and Uniqlo are also popular among Gen Z and Millennial shoppers (11 percent). These stores are all known for their low-priced garments. Now consider that most apparel today is made with polyester, which is derived from petroleum. As CFDA points out, polyester has âsignificant negative environmental impacts during production, use and disposal.ï¿½?To wit, the Materials Systems Laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology reports, polyester requires a large amount of energy to produce: In 2015, production of polyester textiles emitted 706 billion kg (or 778.2 million U.S. tons) of CO2e, or greenhouse gas emissions. That compared to 107.5 million tons of CO2e for cotton. Further, polyester microfibers are contributing to the microplastic pollution in the planetâs oceans and waterways. A recent YPulse sustainability report found more than a third of Gen Z and Millennial shoppers say they âhave changed the products they buy because of climate change, and nearly a third have changed the way they shop, as well.ï¿½?But these younger consumers want brands to get involved in making a change. YPulse found 58 percent of Gen Z and 47 percent of Millennials want brands to create more eco-friendly products. Gen Z (51 percent) and Millennials (42 percent) also want brands to use eco-friendly business practices. âGen Z and Millennials want brands to help them be environmentally responsible when shopping. Over a third tell us they seek out eco-friendly products already,ï¿½?the YPulse report states. âBut their responses also show something else: Gen Z is more likely than Millennials to think brands should be taking many of these eco-friendly actions. Our data shows the younger generation doesnât have the spending power to purchase all of the eco-friendly products they want, with 50 percent saying âIâd like to buy more eco-friendly products, but I care about price more.ï¿½?But clearly they are interested in environmentally conscious items and ultimately they want brands to provide them more eco-friendly options that are accessible to them.ï¿½?âGiven that Gen Z (and their kidsï¿½?generations) will be the ones who will feel and see the long-term effects of climate changes, it makes sense that they would be the most concerned with how the crisis will impact their futures.ï¿½?The Cotton Incorporated Lifestyle Monitor Survey is an ongoing research program that measures consumer attitudes and behaviors relating to apparel, shopping, fashion, sustainability, and more.

Dan Brady, who leads MA Financial's hotel funds business (including the now unlisted Redcape Hotel Group and its $1.2 billion portfolio), said appetite for quality pubs would ""continue to be full in 2022"" and the fund manager would be among those looking to add to its extensive portfolio. ""Pub assets, specifically those operators that own land, buildings and business, are in high demand due to attractive growth in earnings and high barriers to entry,"" Mr Brady said. ""A post-COVID world is likely to reinforce the deep sense of connection that we all have to our local pub."" Data compiled by pub brokers HTL Property shows metropolitan Sydney accounted for about a third of all deals in 2021, reaching almost $700 million, a 75 per cent increase on 2020. These figures included the $160 million of sales racked up by the Stanford family, which sold its three large-format venues in Sydney's outer west. Among these, the Vineyard hotel sold for a record $70 million. HTL Property managing director Andrew Jolliffe said a deep pool of capital seeking assets would keep the investment market buoyant this year. While much of 2021 was dominated by wealthy families, established operators and sophisticated corporate investors beefing up their portfolios, new offshore capital sources made their presence known in the market towards the end of the year, Mr Jolliffe said. ""A lot of them were underbidders in 2021. They won't be in 2022,"" he said. In a further sign of investment appetite, the sector also attracted new local entrants including Martin Scott, Australian boss of Swiss fund manager Partners Group, who swooped on the Lucky Hotel in the Newcastle CBD for about $20 million in December."
81,0,What does the aftermath of the pandemic look like for Chinese restaurants in York Region?,708 words,The Canadian Press,"It cannot be compared with pre-pandemic levels of business, because many employees in the buildings around Fang's restaurant havenât returned to the office yet, but he is relieved that the business situation is gradually improving. A more comforting phenomenon is that the proportion of non-Chinese customers in his restaurant is higher than before. ""This shows that discrimination and hatred towards Chinese restaurants in the beginning of the pandemic were just temporary,"" Fang said. In fact, soaring food bills have been Fangâs primary concern. âWe have been operating at higher costs than ever before,ï¿½?he said, hoping that food prices can be brought under control as soon as possible. With insufficient customer flow, he cannot afford to double the price tag on his dishes. Fang isnât alone in his experience. Tim Tang, who runs a number of Chinese restaurants in Markham and Richmond Hill, has seen business pick up as Ontario has phased out COVID-19 restrictions, but the renewed business comes with more than just joy ï¿½?there have been troubles as well. âWith the improvement of business, a new problem has emerged: the shortage of labour,ï¿½?Tang said, explaining that it has been particularly difficult for restaurants to hire staff, as many people prefer collecting government benefits at home rather than working outside since the pandemic began. âWe can only raise wages, coupled with the rising cost of raw material prices, leading to the increase in the cost of the entire food industry, which can only be passed on to consumers in the end,ï¿½?Tang said. âThis is a vicious circle.ï¿½?Such market chaos was confirmed by Catherine Hou, president of Chinese Cuisine and Hospitality Association of Canada. âMany restaurants are poaching from each other by using high salaries to attract other waiters and waitress to work in their own restaurants,ï¿½?Hou said. She believes this is not a long-term solution. âWe hope to create wealth with hard-working hands, and we also hope that the government can support us with a policy of rewarding diligence and punishing laziness.ï¿½?The restaurant industry has gone through a hugely difficult time, but Walter Wang has no confidence in the quick arrival of a golden recovery period. As the general manager of B&H Investment Management Inc., Wang manages a number of Chinese specialty restaurants, including Xiaolongkan Chinese Fondue and Zao Men Kan. âEven if the restaurants are ready, what about diners?ï¿½?Wang said. He is not sure if there will be increased consumption to make up for the lack of in-person dining and shopping during COVID-19 lockdowns; most of his restaurants are trendy and target young people, and yet the pandemic has forced many international students to stay in China and take online courses, which made him lose his main source of customers. âYou know some restaurants were permanently closed during the pandemic, not because of food or service issues, but because no matter how hard you try, the customers are gone.ï¿½?In the post-pandemic era, Wang feels that most restaurants owners will have to learn to live with the food delivery industry, although it might greatly reduce the amount of hotpots and buffets and reduce overall restaurant profits, as the delivery platforms charge a high commission fee. COVID-19 has changed people's dining habits to a large extent, he said, and all they can do is adopt the market trends, cater to customers and wait for the economic wounds from the pandemic to slowly heal."

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than May 3, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company.

The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, the Offering Documents were negligently prepared and, as a result, contained untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading and were not prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations governing their preparation. Additionally, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding C3.ai's business, operations, and compliance policies. Specifically, the Offering Documents and defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) C3.ai's partnership with Baker Hughes was deteriorating; (2) C3.ai's was employing a flawed accounting methodology to conceal the deterioration of its Baker Hughes partnership; (3) C3.ai faced challenges in product adoption and significant salesforce turnover; (4) C3.ai overstated, inter alia, the extent of its investment in technology, description of its customers, its total addressable market, the pace of its market growth, and the scale of alliances with its major business partners; and (5) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice.

599,0,"2ND LEAD Netherlands eases lockdown, but restaurants and shops to stay closed By Annette Birschel, dpa",394 words,dpa International Service in English,"The easing of rules comes amid pressure from businesses - and outrage in the restaurant and cultural sectors. Rutte said lifting the lockdown completely was not an option due to dramatically rising infection figures. ""Everything at the same time is not possible, the risk is too great,"" he said, while noting that there might be a further easing of the rules at the end of the month. Health Minister Ernst Kuipers said the nation had reached a ""new phase of the pandemic."" He acknowledged that many citizens and business owners were distressed by the nationwide lockdown, currently the only in Europe. ""We have to learn to live with the virus,"" Kuipers added but cautioned that the risk of overwhelming the health system remained high. Opposition to the harsh measures grew strongly over the past few days. Restaurant owners have already announced protests for Saturday and some plan to open again for service despite the ban. Many of these businesses have the support of local mayors. In the southern town of Valkenburg, near the German border city of Aachen, many shops and restaurants were already open on Friday. Following the government's decision, shops will again be allowed to receive customers until 5 pm daily. Citizens can have four visitors in their homes at once, up from two previously. Quarantine requirements will no longer apply to those who have received a booster vaccination or were already infected with the coronavirus this year. Up until now, only supermarkets and pharmacies have been allowed to open. The lockdown, which began on December 19, was intended to ease the pressure on hospitals. And despite daily peaks in new infections, the number of patients in hospitals is decreasing. On Friday, more than 35,000 new infections were registered - more than ever before. That is more than 1,300 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over seven days. # Notebook ## Note to editors - Releads with government announcement and updates throughout - dpa photos"

It has been assessed by experts that those behind the attack have a ""China nexus"" and are ""likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelli- gence to benefit China's interests"", they said. The cyberattack affected a limited number of employees. Based on investigations to date, it is believed that the threat activity has been contained. Kline said: ""We take seriously any attack on our organisation and our employees, including our journalists."" The vast majority of people's emails and documents were not targeted in the attack. News Corp disclosed the hack in a securities filing yesterday. A cyberalert sent out at lunchtime to all employees read: ""On January 20, News Corp discovered attack activity on a system used by several of our business units. ""As soon as we discovered the activity, we notified US law enforcement and launched an investigation with the assistance of Mandiant, a leading cybersecurity firm. ""As part of our efforts, we promptly took steps to contain the activity and our investigation to date indicates that the systems housing customer and financial data were not affected."" News Corp has not experienced any related interruptions to its business operations. It is believed that the activity affected a limited number of business email accounts and documents from News Corp headquarters, News Technology Services, Dow Jones, News UK, and the New York Post. News Corp's ""highest concern is the protection of our employees, including our journalists, and their sources"", the alert said. ""We will not tolerate attacks on our journalism, nor will we be deterred from our reporting, which provides readers everywhere with the news that matters"", Kline and O'Brien added. Dave Wong, vice-president of Mandiant, said: ""Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests."""
460,0,Oh snow! Moment mystery customer falls to his knees in defeat when he discovers Toronto restaurant is closed after trudging through a blizzard,651 words,Mail Online,"* He drops to his knees in despair as soon as he realises the restaurant is shut * The restaurant is offering a free meal to the man labelled 'Nicey's Most Wanted' A restaurant is searching for a mystery customer who was captured falling to his knees in defeat when he discovered the eatery was closed after trudging through a blizzard. CCTV footage shows the man arriving at Nicey's Eatery, a Caribbean-themed restaurant in Scarborough, Toronto, on January 17. He is seen walking up to the restaurant and dropping to his knees in the thick snow as it suddenly dawns on him that it is closed. Posting the video onto their Instagram page, the team at Nicey's Eatery said they were looking for the man and offered him a free meal. In the short video clip, the loyal customer - who the restaurant has now nicknamed 'Nicey's most wanted' - is seen wearing a grey and black jacket with the hood up, a facemask and back tracksuit bottoms. With the snow up to his knees, he trudges his way up to the front of the restaurant. Just a few feet from the front door it suddenly dawns on him that the restaurant is closed. He drops to his knees and raises his left hand up to his head in despair. He remains on his knees with his hands on his hips for a few seconds before struggling out of the snow. He waves his arms out to the side before making his way back home. Valerie Lai, the owner of Niceyâs Eatery, said she and her husband, who is from Jamaica, decided to close the restaurant because of the blizzard. But when they returned the next day they found footprints in the snow and decided to look at the security footage. There they found the clip of the man trudging through the snow and watched the sudden heartbreak as he finds the restaurant closed. 'I am in total disbelief that it happened', Mrs Lai told City News[https://digg.com/video/watch-this-guy-die-inside-after-realizing-his-favorite-restaurant-is-closed-after-trudging-through-the-snow]. 'My heart just went down, I can't believe that this person actually came. I felt really bad that we were not open for him.' Nicey's Eatery posted the video onto their Instagram page where it has been viewed more than 65,000 times, and offered the loyal customer a free meal. In the post, they said: 'To our loyal customer, we don't know who you are but we will be looking out for you. 'We are terribly sorry the restaurant was closed. We feel your disappointment and hope to see you soon. 'What ever you had on your mind to purchase today, that meal is on us.' The video attracted hundreds of comment, including from one user who said: 'Now I must try your food. If he went that hard for a plate. I must try.' Another added: 'I can see his soul crumbling.' A third said: 'This is next level disappointment. This goes to show how incredible the food and service is though.' Nicey's Eatery are appealing for help tracking down the unknown man, and have issued a 'most wanted' poster, adding 'Where are you Mystery man? You are our angel in disguise who has brought unexpected publicity to our restaurant. Who are you? It's been a week now, will you be coming to our doorsteps today? We are waiting and really want to meet.' The man has been described as 'wearing a grey jacket with dark trim, a mask, black joggers with white stripes and in search of soul food'."

464,1,Russiaâs Rostec diversifying production,751 words,Russia's Defense and Technologies Newswire,"""Rostec enterprises are successfully dealing with the diversification task set by the president, doing it ahead of schedule,"" Chemezov said. In 2021, Rostec enterprises sold civilian goods worth more than 900 billion rubles ($11 billion), which made up 45% of the total revenues, he added. According to him, Rostec includes a number of enterprises that have always manufactured civilian products, namely, the Russian Helicopters Group, the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) and Uralvagonzavod. At the same time, Chemezov noted, entry into civilian markets has become a challenge for many enterprises. ""The market of civilian goods is characterized by high uncertainty, there are no guarantees for the sale of manufactured products,"" he noted. ""The unprecedented sanction pressure of recent months on our country by the United States and its allies is both a challenge and a growth opportunity for defense enterprises,"" the Rostec CEO said. According to him, the current situation has two aspects. On the one hand, some components that foreign companies refused to supply will be replaced with products from other suppliers. On the other hand, the withdrawal of some Western companies from the Russian market opens up new prospects for the production of modern domestic civilian goods that are not inferior to their foreign rivals. Chemezov expressed confidence that there would be more such products in future. Production of aircraft engines and planes ""We are planning to start producing 20 import-substituted Sukhoi Superjet planes with Russian-made PD-8 engines per year in 2024,"" Chemezov said. Earlier, Head of the United Aircraft Corporation Yuri Slyusar said that the first flight of the SSJ-100 aircraft with the Russian-made PD-8 engines would take place in early 2023. According to him, the production plan includes 20-30 SSJ-100 aircraft per year, the company is technologically capable of producing up to 40 such planes, including those with Russian components. ""The first six MC-21 with the domestically-made PD-14 engines will be delivered to the customers in 2024,"" Chemezov said. He recalled that the first flight of the MC-21 with a Russian-made composite wing took place in late 2021. The overall percentage of composite materials in MC-21 is 40%, he said. For the MC-21 and SSJ, the United Engine Corporation is developing new power units, while, according to Chemezov, the PD-14 engine, designed for the MC-21, will also be used for a new family of gas turbine plants. Chemezov also said that Russian airlines would start to receive Tupolev Tu-214 and Ilyushin Il-96 aircraft in addition to MC-21 and SSJ-100 airliners. ""These planes are being delivered to special customers in small numbers. Their production is growing,"" Chemezov said. The Rostec CEO explained that the talk was mainly about the supplies of Tu-214 planes. ""The main focus is on the Tu-214, its output will be increased by more than three times, over 70 aircraft by 2030. As for the Il-96, the production growth is not so noticeable, this plane will not be so mass-produced,"" Chemezov explained. Fully Russian-made Kamaz trucks ""Work to localize the production of a new world-class six-cylinder engine with a capacity of 400 to 500 hp deserves special attention,"" Chemezov said. Chemezov recalled that the Kamaz Enterprise planned to produce K5 generation trucks in Russia by 2023. ""Although they were originally developed and created jointly with our foreign partners, we will fully replace foreign-made components by 2023, and from 2023 trucks will be assembled from our Russian components,"" he said. Special hardware The Rostec CEO expressed confidence that domestically produced components would be in demand not only by the Kamaz Enterprise, but also by other Russian transport manufacturers, including those producing agricultural machinery. ""In-demand special equipment is produced by enterprises of the High-Precision Systems Group,"" Chemezov said, adding that the company manufactures mini-loaders, excavators and tractors. As Chemezov said, Kurganmashzavod produces a series of tracked all-terrain vehicles that have excellent cross-country ability, maneuverability and can operate in bad weather conditions. ""In 2021, the companyâs enterprises shipped a total of more than 500 items of civilian special equipment, including for export to Kazakhstan, Armenia and Venezuela,"" he added."

222,0,"Full list of flood-hit restaurants reopened, still closed",1352 words,Courier Mailï¿½?- âOnline,"The damage bill Mr Rennell estimates as close to $1 million, plus revenue losses of around $50,000-$70,000 each week they are closed ï¿½?and thatâs not even including his recently launched new culinary precinct Craftâd Grounds next door. Housing the Seven Miles Coffee Roasters headquarters, Brewtide Brewing and K.I.S.S. Burgers, the venue, which was built to withstand one-in-100-year flooding, had water come through 400mm above the timber floorboards, wiping out all their stock and equipment, including a $60,000 coffee grinding machine ï¿½?with at least a two-month wait for it all to be replaced. âEverything that was in this venue had to be thrown, so all that stock is gone, we threw it and we donât even want to put a figure on what that meant to us,ï¿½?he says. But just when Mr Rennell says he felt at rock bottom, clean-up volunteers began flooding through the doors. âFrom there I just thought, well thereâs only way and thatâs up, so letâs get on with it,ï¿½?he says. While to be fully functioning will take months, Craftâd Grounds is already open for coffee, and hopes to transform into a temporary liquor store, with a small range of cakes, to keep the venue ticking over. As for Collingwood Black, Mr Rennell is on a three-week deadline, after promising a bride her wedding will go ahead there in less than a month. Across the road at recently opened distillery Granddad Jackâs, everything has also been lost. Water shin-deep swamped the bar and spirit making equipment rendering it useless, but owners David and Luke Ridden have vowed to rebuild. Brisbane culinary icon Jocelynâs Provisions down the road is another heartbreaking story, their major production kitchen in Albion supplying their four stores has been wiped out, with the entire business and every outlet having to close as they simply cannot make product. Next door, Brett Hutleyâs voice shakes, he is audibly close to tears as he looks around his submerged business, brown and muddied from flood waters. Botanica Real Food was the work of he and wife Alison, starting as a single store selling salads and cakes out of Red Hill about a decade ago, before blossoming into a successful business with five outlets across Brisbane, and a major production kitchen at Albion, which supplies all venues. On Sunday, that four-month-old production kitchen became filled with water around knee height ï¿½?destroying all their equipment, stock, their delivery vehicles and rendering their entire business inoperable. âWe spent so much money down here and itâs just devastating. I can barely speak,ï¿½?he says, fighting back tears. âItâs just destroyed everything. I donât think weâre going to have insurance to cover it. Weâve got about 60 staff.ï¿½?While the newly built building was constructed to sit above the one-in-100-year flood levels, it was still inundated with water, and despite the coupleâs best efforts to lift things to higher ground, they were too late. Now the pair is left assessing the damage, unsure how to start again, with only their Greenhaus Coffee shop in Teneriffe operational. âThis will be close to wiping us out,ï¿½?Mr Hutley says. Equally heartbreaking stories can be heard from all corners of the city. Thereâs Peach Cafe in Auchenflower, which went under, with the young owners devastated and unsure when they can reopen, while their almost completed renovation out the back has been significantly pushed back. At South Bank, The Spaghetti House was just starting to get back on track after Covid had dampened trade, when the carpark housing their power was flooded, causing them to lose all their stock. With the power issue still not sorted, they donât know when theyâll be able to reopen. In New Farm, popular cafes Joedyâs and Miss Jones were both damaged, amassing big bills on lost supplies and lost revenue. âFinancially, itâs been difficult. Iâve dipped into all my savings to keep afloat with the hope we can turn the corner,ï¿½?says Tam Pham of Miss Jones. In Wilston, popular cafe Willow & Spoon has been without power for a week, unable to clean up and watching the mud dry on its walls. In Bulimba, the rain damaged the roof so badly at Melrose restaurant and bar it lead to internal destruction, with the venue now forced to close for two weeks for repairs. While popular Brisbane caterers Cuisine on Cue and Wine & Dineâm were both affected and have been in clean-up mode. In Zillmere and Newstead, tiny family owned business Banh Mi Factory were inundated with flood waters, losing stock and fridges. Family and friends pitched in to clean up and upon reopening at Zillmere were met with long queues of customers desperate to dine in and support them. But the support needs to keep coming, hospitality operators say. Compounded by two years of Covid hell, business owners are asking for people to dine in with them and keep dining in with them after the clean-up finishes. They want the community to support the industry that employs the most Queenslanders in the state.

820,0,Andrew Forrest launches criminal action against Facebook over scam ads that used his image,599 words,The Guardian,"The action in the Western Australia magistrates court is the first time Facebook has faced criminal charges anywhere in the world, Forrest said on Thursday. The charges allege Facebook was criminally reckless by not taking sufficient steps to stop criminals from using its social media platform to send scam advertisements that aimed to defraud Australian users. It is alleged the scam advertisements ï¿½?which used Forrestâs image and purported to promote cryptocurrency investment schemes ï¿½?have appeared on Facebook since March 2019. Forrest, the chairman of Fortescue Metals Group, also claims Facebook failed to create controls or a corporate culture that would prevent its systems from being used to commit alleged crimes. It is unusual for a private citizen to bring criminal charges against a corporation. Forrest said he had sought and received approval from Australiaâs attorney general, Michaelia Cash, to launch the action under the commonwealth criminal code. The attorney general has been contacted for comment. Forrest in September 2021 launched civil proceedings against Facebook in California in the US. The Australian legal action comes after Forrest asked Facebook to prevent his image from being used to scam Australian users ï¿½?including an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg in November 2019. âIâm doing this because Iâm concerned about innocent Australians being scammed through clickbait advertising on social media,ï¿½?Forest said on Thursday. âIâm committed to ensuring that social media operators donât allow their sites to be used by criminal syndicates. âThis action is being taken on behalf of those everyday Australians ï¿½?mums and dads, grans and grandads ï¿½?who work all their lives to gather their savings and to ensure those savings arenât swindled away by scammers. Iâm acting here for Australians but this is happening all over the world.ï¿½? Facebook said it couldnât comment on Forrestâs case specifically because it was âa potentially active legal matterï¿½? But the company said generally âwe donât want ads seeking to scam people out of money or mislead people on Facebook ï¿½?they violate our policies and are not good for our communityï¿½? *  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning[https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed]  A spokesperson told Guardian Australia: âWe take a multifaceted approach to stop these ads, we work not just to detect and reject the ads themselves but also block advertisers from our services and, in some cases, take court action to enforce our policies. Weâre committed to keeping these people off our platform.ï¿½?One difficulty for social media companies and publishers is that scammers often use technology to show different content to users and internal ad reviewers ï¿½?a practice called âcloakingï¿½? But Forrest said he wanted social media companies to use their resources and revenue to protect vulnerable people. âSocial media is part of our lives, but itâs in the public interest for more to be done to ensure fraud on social media platforms is eliminated or significantly reduced,ï¿½?the mining magnate said on Thursday. An initial court hearing in WA is scheduled for 28 March, with a committal hearing expected later in 2022. Additional reporting by Narelle Towie"
343,1,Koreaâs No. 2 app market One Store keeps to IPO band of $28-34 for pricing on May 10,353 words,Maeil Business Newspaper,"Public subscription will take place on May 12-13 with an aim to list the company on the Kospi market by the end of May. The operator of One Store claimed it has applied maximum 41.5 percent discount to its valuation, which is higher than latest IPO candidates to brush aside overvaluation claims. It added warning that it could go on incurring losses to expand in the app market dominated by Google. It will float 6,660,000 shares, including 4,725,000 new issues. Its market capitalization would reach 1.1 trillion won upon making the public debut, based on the top end of 41,700 won. It changed its reference for valuation to Tencent, Naver, Kako, and Nexon from previous bigger multinational tech giants, Apple and Alphabet (parent of Google). One Store is operator of its namesake mobile app store One Store, which was launched in 2016 as a local alternative to Googleâs Play store on the Android operating system. Its major shareholder is Korean telco giant SK Telecom Co., which established the app marketplace in partnership with other local wireless carriers KT and LG Uplus, and internet giant Naver. One Store plans to use the IPO proceeds primarily on upgrading its mobile app store platform to expand its presence in the global market. It currently services only in Korea, where it commands about 14 percent share. One Storeâs IPO is jointly led by NH Investment & Securities, KB Securities, and SK Securities, with Hana Financial Investment and Daishin Securities as co-underwriters.

675,1,Amazon CEO Andy Jassy Pledges to Improve Worker Safety in Shareholder Letter -- Update,762 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"""We spent Amazon's first 25 years building a very large fulfillment network, and then had to double it in the last 24 months to meet customer demand,"" Mr. Jassy said. He also noted the challenges of the labor shortage and supply-chain issues that led to higher costs. On employee safety, he said the company's injury rates were ""sometimes misunderstood"" but vowed to do better. ""We're not close to being done in how we improve the lives of our employees,"" Mr. Jassy said in the letter. He noted that the company identified ""the top 100 employee experience pain points"" and is working to try to solve them. ""We're also passionate about further improving safety in our fulfillment network, with a focus on reducing strains, sprains, falls, and repetitive stress injuries,"" he said. On the company's injury rates, he said incidents in its warehouses were slightly above Amazon's peers' average, and slightly lower than the company's peers' average in the courier and delivery business. He said those numbers put the company at about average compared with its peers, but that the company wants ""to be best in class."" ""When I first started in my new role, I spent significant time in our fulfillment centers and with our safety team, and hoped there might be a silver bullet that could change the numbers quickly,"" he added. ""I didn't find that."" Mr. Jassy took over Amazon from Mr. Bezos, the founder who is now executive chairman of the company. Mr. Bezos used to write annual shareholder letters since the company went public in 1997. The letters often highlighted the company's successes, usually told with a storytelling flourish. In a CNBC interview on Thursday, Mr. Jassy said he speaks to Mr. Bezos weekly. ""It's great to have a sounding board,"" he said. ""He has so much wisdom."" Mr. Jassy's comments about worker safety come as one of the company's warehouses in Staten Island, N.Y., recently voted to unionize. Amazon said in a legal filing last week it intends to appeal the loss because of actions taken by the National Labor Relations Board and the Amazon Labor Union. ""It's [the] employees' choice whether or not they want to join a union,"" Mr. Jassy said on CNBC. ""We happen to think they're better off not doing so."" He noted employees tend to perform better when they have direct connections with their managers. ""If [employees] see something they can do better for customers or for themselves, they can go meet in a room, decide how to change it and change it,"" he said on CNBC. ""That type of empowerment doesn't happen when you have unions. It's much more bureaucratic, it's much slower."" While Amazon hired more than 300,000 workers last year, Mr. Jassy said on CNBC that the company still didn't have enough people in certain locations. Mr. Jassy also touched on the company's popular Prime business. He said that prior to the pandemic, Amazon had decided to put billions of incremental dollars over multiple years toward boosting the number of Prime packages it was delivering on a daily basis. ""This initiative was slowed by the challenges of the pandemic, but we've since resumed our focus here,"" Mr. Jassy said in his letter. Mr. Jassy in his letter also addressed Amazon's carbon footprint and said the company is making significant progress on its climate pledge to be net-zero carbon by 2040. He said Amazon is committed to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of the company's initial target.  Amazon reported in February that fourth-quarter earnings nearly doubled and revenue rose. Mr. Jassy at the time said the company's costs were higher over the holidays because of inflation and labor supply shortages.

425,0,Barcelona hotels lose up to ï¿½?.5bn since start of pandemic,407 words,Catalan News by ACN,"Hotel stays in the Catalan capital were lower than first expected. At the beginning of the year, it was thought 85% of the hotels would be open. However, at the end of the year, only 73% were open. For this reason, the sector hopes that the Mobile World Congress (MWC) will mark a turning point. So far, there are 10,000 bookings for the MWC, held in the city between February 28 and March 3. Despite the ""good figures,"" Clos did not want to make any firm predictions. Tourism still low The tourism industry is still lagging behind after the coronavirus pandemic and business is still ""quite slow,"" Clos said during the press conference. Right now, tourists only represent 8% to 15% of occupied rooms in Barcelona. The loss of international tourism has affected the city as, before the coronavirus, 85% of visitors came from abroad. To soften the fall, hotels had to reduce their prices up to 40% to attract Spanish tourists. Barcelona, different from Madrid Jordi Clos avoided making comparisons between Barcelona and Madrid, as they have different target markets. The Spanish capital ""does not depend as much as Barcelona on the international market,"" Clos said. In December, the Catalan city had 27% of hotels closed, a similar figure to New York City (25%), Tokyo (20%), or Rome (30%). One year, three periods The hotel sector in Barcelona does not want to analyze 2021 as one whole year, instead dividing it into three different periods. During the first one, January to April, hotels had ""really low"" occupancy, not filling more than 20% of rooms. Later, between May and September, the vaccination campaign and the lifting of some restrictions, especially on travel, allowed 50% to open. The summer period saw an average occupancy of 50%. Finally, in the third period, from October to December, figures dropped again as the sector registered around 30% of rooms booked, with the exception of New Yearâs Eve [https://www.catalannews.com/../../../../../life-style/item/barcelona-cancels-its-new-year-s-eve-alternative-party]when the number increased to 60%."

892,0,"Social media bosses from YouTube, Facebook, TikTok and Twitter are labelled a 'disgrace' for not doing enough to stamp down on online scams in tough grilling from MPs",2409 words,Mail Online,"* Demanded that all four firms paid back money that had been defrauded off Britons for 'many years' Social media bosses were labelled a 'disgrace' in the Houses of Parliament today for failing to do enough to stop online scams in an extraordinary attack by a furious committee chairman. Conservative MP Julian Knight left executives from YouTube, Facebook, TikTok and Twitter sitting in silence as he condemned their refusal to share information on scam artists with each other to protect the public. He demanded that all four companies paid back money that had been defrauded off Britons for 'many years' while the firms were taking adverts from companies not authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Mr Knight said none of the companies share the data with each other and were only doing so with the 'already overworked' police, giving scammers a better chance of targetting social media users on different platforms. He compared this to the Mail Order Protection Scheme (Mops), an old scheme run by newspapers where direct response adverts were vetted before publication and the findings shared with other publishers to protect readers. Pausing his questioning of the four bosses today, an exasperated 50-year-old Mr Knight issued the attack around 20 minutes into a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport sub-committee on online harms and disinformation today. He spoke to 'all social media platforms' - including witnesses Iain Bundred, YouTube's head of public policy in the UK and Ireland; Richard Earley, the UK public policy manager for Facebook owner Meta; Elizabeth Kanter, TikTok's director of government relations and public policy; and Niamh McDade, Twitter's deputy head of UK policy. Conmen stole Â£754million from Britons through fraud in just the first half of 2021 which was an increase of 30 per cent on the previous year according to trade group UK Finance - with most of these scams originating online. Interrupting an answer being given by Mr Earley today, Mr Knight said: 'I'll be honest with you, my thoughts - this goes to all social media platforms, frankly - is that you ought to pay back the money that has been defrauded off the British public over many years while you have been taking adverts which are not FCA authorised.' Mr Knight has plenty of expertise in the media industry having been a personal finance and consumer rights journalist before entering the House of Commons. The MP for Solihull started off as a personal finance reporter for BBC News before becoming the money and property editor for the Independent on Sunday in 2007. What was the Mail Order Protection Scheme? The Mail Order Protection Scheme, known as 'Mops', was a reader protection scheme run by the Newspaper Publishers' Association and Periodical Publishers' Association groups for advertisements intended to be displayed in newspaper and magazines. It meant that direct response advertisements were vetted before publication and advertisers have to contribute to a pool which was available to be used to compensation a reader who lost money because a trader went bankrupt. The scheme did not cover classified adverts or goods supplied on approval. In 2006 the scheme was renamed to the Safe Homes Ordering Protection Scheme, or 'Shops', with the intention of emphasising that it protected consumers when they ordered by mail order, telephone or internet. The scheme had been supported by consumer rights champion Lynn Faulds-Wood and companies including John Lewis and the Royal Mint, but it was dissolved last October according to Companies House records. And he told today's hearing in the Grimond Room at Portcullis House: 'Now I used to work in the dim and distant past in the newspaper industry and at that stage we used to have Mail Order 'Mops', it was called. 'You used to be able to see precisely whether or not a company had a deposit, whether or not it was authorised therefore to trade, and whether or not it could effectively advertise in your newspaper. 'And if you found that there was any sort of idea or linkage or the idea that effectively these companies could not so, you phone each other up, you got on the phone, you told each other this company is dodgy and do not take their adverts.' He continued: 'Now I don't see anything in what you've just said there, in fact I know across all your companies, none of you have effectively even shared this data with each other - you do share it to the police, they're already overworked - but you don't do it with each other. 'And then secondly, as a result, you have for many years taken money from these scam artists and not actually made sure, the one thing you could do to stop it, which is to prevent anyone advertising with you who was not FCA authorised. 'Personally, I think that's a disgrace and I think it's been going on for far too long. And each and every one of your companies should refund the British public any scam money they've been removed. 'That's actually not a question. That's an observation I have to say at this point. But I just have to say anything you say in that regard, I think you've just not done enough over a long period of time.' Speaking directly to Mr Earley, Mr Knight said: 'It seems incredible to me and to the public, the idea that you are systematically, over a period of years, making money from our constituents' misery over being defrauded. 'You are making money off that and you are continuing to make money, and you're still waiting for legislation to come forward before you appropriately react in order to exclude these scams from your platforms permanently.' Mr Earley defended Meta's review process, which he said checks over any advertisement to ensure it is in line with their compliance and advertisement policies. However, despite announcing last year that it would do so, Meta's review process does not currently enforce that all advertisements are authorised by the FCA. Rishi writes off Â£4.3bn taken by shameless fraudsters from furlough and other business support during lockdown By DAVID WILCOCK FOR MAILONLINE More than Â£4billion of taxpayers money taken by Covid fraudsters during the pandemic could be written off by the Treasury. Figures released by HM Revenue and Customs show that some Â£5.8billion has been criminally siphoned off from furlough and other business relief schemes since coronavirus struck. A taskforce set up to get the money back has so far got its hands on around Â£500million, and is projected to have received a further Â£1billion by the end of 2023. But questions remain over the fate of the remaining Â£4.3billion, almost three-quarters of the total, with the Times today suggesting it could simply be ignored. Downing Street did not deny the money could be written off today, with a spokesman instead highlighting the positive impact the furlough scheme had had on the economy. But shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: 'While prices soar, billions in hard-earned taxpayer cash has been frittered away by fraud - and the Chancellor is happy to shrug his shoulders and lose it forever.' The Prime Minister's official spokesman today told reporters: 'We introduced these unprecedented Covid support schemes at speed to protect jobs and livelihoods. The result of the action is that the economy is back to pre-pandemic levels, and we are the first major European economy to report that. Employee numbers are growing at a record rate and redundancies are at their lowest level since December 2006. 'Obviously fraud is unacceptable and we are taking action against those abusing the system;. 150,000 ineligible claims blocked, Â£500m recovered last year and HMRC taxpayer protection taskforce is expected to recover an additional Â£1bn of taxpayers' money.' Mr Knight said: 'People have lost thousands of pounds, some people have lost their entire livelihoods, frankly we have had people commit suicide as a result of the scams, and you have continued to take advertising throughout the entire time from organisations which are not FCA authorised, and only now are you pulling your finger out and bringing that very crucial change. You have just not done enough.' He added: 'This goes for all social media platforms actually, you ought to pay back the money that has been defrauded off the British public over many years.' Mr Earley said in response: 'We have been working to try and tackle these uses of our platform ever since we first began to run adverts on our platforms many years ago. 'Certainly one of the big challenges we face is that fraud and advertising scams are by their very nature designed to be difficult to tell apart from authentic advertising. 'That's why we've invested so much money in not just the pre-uploading review... but also our ability to see how scams are performing and use technology to look at any inauthentic signals from the producers of the adverts themselves as well.' Representatives from Meta, Twitter, Instagram and TikTok were given a grilling by MPs at the hearing, which focused on an inquiry into online safety and online harms and which has previously heard evidence from ex-Love Island contestant Amy Hart. Mr Knight also quoted money-saving expert Martin Lewis, who he said 'pulls his hair out' at the number of paid-for scam advertisements on Facebook using his face. The MP criticised the companies for not sharing data with each other regarding scams, calling it a 'disgrace' that 'has been going on far too long'. During the panel, Twitter was also heavily criticised for its verification process by John Nicolson, MP for the Scottish National Party, Ochil and South Perthshire. He cited a Twitter account that was created under the name Mickey Mouse, with the email address 'MickeyMouseIsNotMyRealName', and a phone number from a phone that cost 99p, that then tweeted the footballer Marcus Rashford the word 'squeak'. Mr Nicolson called Twitter's verification system 'hopeless and chaotic' and said it did not work. He said: 'You've tried to manipulate the description of an anonymous account, because someone like that Mickey Mouse account is designated as a non-anonymous account under your current system. Your system does not work.' He added: 'If you can't protect him (Marcus Rashford) what hope is there for all the anonymous folk who just get the daily misery if they use your platform, of abuse?' Ms McDade defended the system in place. She said she was not aware of the specific account Mr Nicolson was referring to, but did condemn all forms of racist abuse on the platform. And Ms McDade said Twitter was 'constantly evolving our rules and policies in terms of the environments we're working within, in terms of the challenges that are faced by our users and communities across the world'. The social media leaders also said that the different companies do work together through other platforms including on the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children which reports to the National Crime Agency. It comes after Culture Minister Chris Philp told MPs last week that there are a 'number of areas' where the Online Safety Bill can be 'improved substantially', with a revised piece of legislation expected in the coming months. MPs have been debating a report by the Joint Committee on the Draft Online Safety Bill, which said more offences needed to be covered. These included paid-for scam and fraudulent advertising, cyber flashing, content promoting self-harm and the deliberate sending of flashing images to people with photosensitive epilepsy. The Bill must also be clearer about what is specifically illegal online and proposed that pornography sites should have a legal duty to keep children off them regardless of whether they host user-to-user content, the report added among other recommendations. The legislation is expected to force the biggest operators, such as Meta ï¿½?formerly Facebook ï¿½?and Google, to abide by a duty of care to users, overseen by Ofcom as the new regulator for the sector. It comes as Ministers revealed today that cryptocurrency adverts will have to meet the same standards as other financial promotions, such as insurance, to help protect people from potentially misleading claims. Promotions will be brought into line with other financial advertising, ensuring they are fair and clear, and helping people to make informed decisions, the Government said. Under the plans, the promotion of cryptoassets will come under FCA rules - in line with other financial promotions, for example, stocks, shares, and insurance products. The Government said this will balance the desire to encourage innovation with the need to ensure adverts are fair, clear, and not misleading. Around 2.3 million people in the UK are thought to own cryptoassets but research suggests some users may not fully understand what they are buying - posing a risk that products could be mis-sold. Around Â£300 of cryptoassets are held on average. The changes will be brought in by amending the Financial Promotion Order, which sets out the investments and activities to which the financial promotion regime applies. Under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, a business cannot promote a financial product unless they are authorised by the FCA or the PRA (Prudential Regulation Authority), or the content of the promotion is approved by a firm which is. Firms that wish to promote such investments and activities must comply with binding rules that financial promotions must be fair, clear, and not misleading. The legislation will be brought forward once parliamentary time allows, the Government said.  Santander UK recently warned that around Â£1 million of cryptocurrency scams were being reported to it by customers each month. The bank said it had seen an increase in the value of such cases, which can involve a fraudster taking over a victim's computer and freezing them out of their accounts. Customers may see adverts online for cryptocurrency investment 'opportunities', or be introduced to them by other social media users, and adverts can appear to be endorsed by celebrities."
873,1,A HARD SHOVE TO BOOST RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS,993 words,The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal,"The House of Representatives recently approved a bill that will increase the age that people are required to start withdrawing money from their retirement accounts from 72 to age 75 in three steps over the next 11 years. The comprehensive retirement bill called Securing a Strong Retirement Act of 2022 - or Secure Act 2.0 - passed the U.S. House by a vote of 414-5, and will now go to the U.S. Senate where it has bipartisan support. If it becomes law, Secure 2.0 will be the second time in three years that Congress has raised the required minimum distribution, or RMD age. It would establish a schedule to raise the age in stages until the year 2033. ""While a bit complicated to keep track of in my humble opinion, I like the fact that people will be able to delay further the requirement of taking money out of IRAs if they don't need the money - thus delaying paying income tax on that money,"" said financial adviser J. Victor Conrad, owner of Pinnacle Financial Strategies in Pine Township, Pennsylvania. Broad approach The legislation builds on the first Secure Act, which was passed in 2019, and paints a broad brush across the entire spectrum of retirement issues - opening the doors of access to retirement plans for more people, allowing retirement savers to put away more. The act would require employers to auto enroll workers in retirement plans - which will result in more savings. It increases the limits on catch-up contributions for older workers and makes special provisions for workers burdened with student loan debt by allowing employers to match the workers' debt payments with contributions to the workers' retirement account. ""The act appears to significantly strengthen and expand opportunities for individuals to build retirement assets,"" said Chris Chaney, a vice president and financial adviser at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Green Tree, Pennsylvania. ""This is a recognition that Social Security will likely face challenges,"" Chaney said. ""So, the more assets people can build for themselves the better."" People with enough retirement income to live on can let their IRAs sit in tax-deferred investments and let the balances grow before having to pay taxes on the money if Secure 2.0 becomes law. The federal government requires retirement account owners to start withdrawing a minimum percentage of the account balance when they reach a certain age so that the person can begin paying taxes on the withdrawals. For years, the age for RMD was 70 1/2. The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act, also known as the Secure Act of 2019, increased the age to 72. Secure 2.0 also encourages more retirement dollars going into Roth retirement accounts. Roth account contributions receive no pre-tax benefit. Money that goes into those accounts is taxed upfront. But account owners can withdraw money from Roth accounts tax-free in retirement. Currently, employer matching contributions to retirement plans must be paid into pretax accounts. Under Secure 2.0, starting in 2023, company retirement plan sponsors could allow employees to elect for some or all of their matching contributions to be treated as Roth contributions. ""These post-tax contributions, as I understand it, would not be excluded from employees' gross taxable income,"" Conrad said. ""So that's something to be aware of, since currently, company matching contributions in the pretax account is not included in the employees' taxable income. ""I frankly like this option being made available to savers,"" he said, ""just need to be aware of the tax treatment of the Roth company matching contribution."" Bigger catch-up rates Secure 2.0 keeps the existing 401k and 403b plan catch-up contribution limits for those age 50 through 61. But the annual catch-up amount for retirement plan participants ages 62 through 64 increases to $10,000 starting in 2024. Another change in retirement savings rules that encourages Roth contributions is that starting in 2023, all catch-up contributions to employer-sponsored plans must be made to Roth accounts. It also expands automatic enrollment. Whereas employers have had the option to add eligible new employees to their retirement plans since the late 1990s, Secure 2.0 requires employers that offer qualified retirement plans to enroll all newly eligible employees in the plan at a 3% contribution level that ticks up by 1% annually to 10%. Shana Bielich, vice president at Coghill Investment Strategies, said Secure 2.0 will make retirement saving more accessible. ""Several studies suggest that most Americans are not adequately saving for a secure financial future,"" she said. ""For some, it may be because retirement is too far in the future. ... But for most, they simply don't have enough resources to allocate to a retirement plan."" Running out of money in retirement worries 63% of non-retirees more than the fear of death, according to a new study from Allianz Life based in Minneapolis. Kelly LaVigne, vice president of consumer insights at Allianz Life, said the study found pre-retirees are concerned about the current market and aren't sure how they will be able to save enough for retirement. He believes provisions in Secure 2.0 such as auto enrollment in 401Ks at 3% and allowing employer matching contributions for workers saddled with student loan debt will address some of the retirement savings gap. ""What this does for the younger saver is it puts money away for retirement before they even see it or before they miss it,"" LaVigne said. ""And it encourages saving for future retirement. The earlier you start the better off you are."" CREDIT: TIM GRANT Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"

166,0,Golden Arches bend to pressure as McDonald's closes Russian restaurants,403 words,Financial Times,"Chief executive Chris Kempczinski said it was ""impossible to predict"" when McDonald's would be able to reopen its restaurants in Russia. The company was experiencing supply chain disruption as a result of the conflict and would continue to monitor the ""humanitarian situation"" in the region, he added.  McDonald's is the latest in a string of companies to put its business on hold in Russia, but the Golden Arches stand out as one of the US brands that became a symbol of the post-Soviet era. When the first McDonald's opened in Moscow on January 30 1990, more than 30,000 people queued for a burger. This week Levi Strauss, whose blue jeans were coveted on the black market in Soviet Russia, also said it would suspend commercial operations in Russia. Kempczinski said the situation was ""extraordinarily challenging"" for a global brand such as McDonald's. ""For 66 years, we have operated with the belief that communities are made better when there's a McDonald's nearby,"" he said. ""At the same time, our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine.""  McDonald's decision comes as Danone's chief executive told the Financial Times that the French maker of dairy products and baby formula would stay in Russia despite the western corporate exodus, insisting it had a ""responsibility"" to its Russian consumers. The food and drinks group faces a hit to its business from the war in Ukraine and its fallout in Russia. Bernstein analysts estimate that the company earns about 6 per cent of its ï¿½?4bn in annual revenue in Russia, making it the most exposed of Europe's large consumer groups. Asked whether remaining in Russia would damage Danone's reputation, Antoine de Saint-Affrique said: ""We have a responsibility to the people we feed, the farmers who provide us with milk and the tens of thousands of people who depend on us."""

166,1,Romania - Energy Companies - Electricity - Generation,438 words,Global Energy Research,"Nuclearelectrica (Ministry of Energy 82.5%, Fondul Proprietatea 9.1%) is the second largest generator: it operates the 1.3 GW Cernavoda nuclear plant (nearly 11 TWh in 2020, 21% of total generation). In 2013, the Government sold a 10% stake in the company through a capital increase and an IPO. A new capital increase was organised in 2015 but failed to attract minority shareholders.  CE Oltenia (100% state-owned) ranks third with a capacity of 3.2Â GW of lignite-fired power plants and 14% of total power generation. CE Oltenia was created in 2013 following the restructuring of Termoelectrica and the merger of several power plants (Craiova, Rovinari, and Turceni) with the mining company SNLO. CE Oltenia plans to shut down all its lignite-fired capacity by 2025 and to build 1.4 GW of gas-fired capacities and 300 MW of solar. The government plans to sell a 15% stake in CE Oltenia through a capital increase and an IPO; a restructuring process has been launched to increase its attractiveness for investors. (In February 2021, the European Commission opened an investigation on the compliance of the restructuring plan with EU state aid rules.) Other large power producers include OMV Petrom (OMV 51%, State 20.6%, Fondul Proprietatea 7%), which commissioned an 860Â MW CCGT in Brazi in 2012 (4.2 TWh in 2020), Electrocentrale BucureÅti (Elcen, 97.5% state owned, 2.5% Romgaz), which operates 4 power plants supplying heat and electricity to Budapest (less than 2 TWh in 2020), and CE Hunedoara (1.2Â GW at Mintia Deva and ParoÅeni, in insolvency since 2019). In April 2021, Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA) acquired ÄEZ's power generation assets in Romania (mostly the 600 MW Fantanele-Cogealac wind park), along with Distributie Energie Oltenia and an electricity and gas supply business with 1.4 million residential and industrial connections in the Southwest of Romania.

The two-day event was held on April 12 and April 13 under the theme âInspire: Accelerating your Digital Maturityï¿½? âDue to their size, some small businesses are more agile and can more easily incorporate new technologies, thereby positioning themselves to compete successfully with larger companies."" Senator Aubyn Hill, minister of industry, investment and commerce Hill argued that digital maturity is not just for highly capitalised businesses. âSmall businesses, too, can adopt technology to improve their return on investment. Due to their size, some small businesses are more agile and can more easily incorporate new technologies, thereby positioning themselves to compete successfully with larger companies,ï¿½?the minister said. Hill commended the tTech management and staff for their entrepreneurial and focused leadership over the years. This focus and leadership, he said, âhas given birth to one of our premier technology service companies in Jamaicaï¿½? âI also commend you for providing this annual conference, where leaders across various sectors of industry can benefit from the robust exchange of experiences, perspectives, and ideas to which this conference lends itself,ï¿½?Hill added. IMPORTANCE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION The minister commended and encouraged local businesses, which have been employing creative digital solutions to offer an improved customer experience and earning improved profits While consumers were encouraged to take the step towards digital maturity, he highlighted the importance of consumer protection as a way for businesses to safeguard themselves against cybercrime. Citing the Data Protection Act, which was passed in the Senate on June 12, 2020, and which provides guidelines on how personal data should be handled in physical or electronic forms, he said that âall business owners who manage customer data must familiarise themselves and their staff with the tenets of this Act, to ensure complianceï¿½?

967,0,Read the obnoxious texts a would-be customer sent a restaurant owner after Covid forced him to close his restaurant and cancel her booking,676 words,Mail Online,"* The owners were forced to cancel 240 guests bookings over the weekend * A disgruntled customer replied with abusive messages, calling them a 'disgrace' * They accused the eatery of being 'unprofessional' and giving 'next to no notice' A would-be customer of a high-end Tasmanian restaurant has bombarded the owners with abusive texts after their booking was cancelled because of the state's Covid outbreak. The Agarian Kitchen Eatery, in New Norfolk, 32km north of Hobart, was forced to temporarily close on January 7 due to staff shortages after several workers contracted the virus. Announcing with a 'heavy heart' their business would be shutting for at least six-days, owners Rodd Dunn and his wife Severine Demanet issued an apology to customers, saying the closure would be re-assessed on January 13. 'We have watched closely as rising Covid cases have resulted in staff shortages all across Australia, not only in the hospitality industry,' they posted on the restaurant's Instagram page. 'Every couple of hours another restaurant temporarily closes - it has been heart breaking to read and we have been preparing ourselves for this momentï¿½? but it has come much sooner than we expected.' The couple advised they would be in contact with customers to cancel upcoming bookings and thanked regulars and dinners for their ongoing support. But while most reservation holders were understanding, one outraged prospective guest slammed the restaurant owners for providing 'next to no notice'. In screenshots of the fiery text exchange, posted online by head chef Stephen Peak, the disgruntled would-be guest labelled the restaurant a 'disgrace' after being notified about the situation. 'That's incredibly unsatisfactory... I can't believe you give [sic] us next to no notice when we are travelling to Tasmania for a birthday treat for my partner to go to your restaurant,' the person wrote to the owner. 'What are we now meant to do? So much for professionalism in Australian hospitality. This is a disgrace!!!!! And to think you end with the 'kind regards' expression.' After the owners suggested they hoped the person would consider visiting their eatery during more favourable time, the prospective diner launched into another attack. 'Why would I ever visit Tasmania again? You're a rude person in the extreme,' the rant continued. 'I cannot believe your lack of endeavour and reliance on Covid as a crutch... Australia needs to get back to work. How would you have coped in world war. Not I suspect. 'I will never darken your door again and will so inform all my friends and acquaintances of which there are many.' Sharing the messages on Instagram, Mr Peak said almost all of the 240 guests whose bookings were understanding and wished the business and sick staff well. He said the support was much appreciated but it was really upsetting to receive furious responses from some people. 'No one wants to close. No one wants to risk financial security. No one wants to be without work,' he wrote over the screen shots. 'Please be kind! Please treat everyone with respect.' The post quickly went viral across social media as appalled Aussies slammed the diner's reaction. 'This is particularly upsetting given that my partner and I recently had to cancel our trip to TAS - and our booking at AK - super last minute because we both got COVID and the co-founder responded so kindly and didnât charge us,' one woman Tweeted. Others vowed to rally behind the restaurant by booking in once it reopened. 'This restaurant is now on my bucket list,' one woman said. 'What an incredibly unpleasant person. Will make a point to visit the Agrarian Kitchen when they reopen, because I am this petty,' another said."
180,0,The Ukraine Crisis: Pepsi and Coke Take a Step Back,797 words,The Wall Street Journal,"Large Western companies are under increasing pressure to pull out of the country in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Many companies -- such as American Express Co ., Shell PLC and Boeing Co . -- already have announced plans to suspend or scale back their operations. Those moves came after Western governments imposed sanctions on the country in retaliation for the invasion, and financial firms took steps that could close off Russia from global markets.  McDonald's said it was temporarily closing its roughly 850 restaurants in the country and would continue paying the 62,000 people it employs in Russia. The company said it couldn't yet determine when it might reopen the restaurants in Russia and would consider whether any additional steps might be required Coke's business in Russia and Ukraine contributed about 1% to 2% of its operating revenues and income in 2021. The company had an ownership interest of about 21% in Coca-Cola HBC AG , Coke's bottling and distribution partner in the region, as of Dec. 31.  Coca-Cola HBC and PepsiCo both import soft-drink concentrates to Russia from Ireland and bottle drinks in local plants. Coca-Cola HBC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  Unilever PLC also said it was suspending imports and exports of its products into and out of Russia. Unilever , which doesn't break out sales in the region, said it would continue to supply the essential food and hygiene products it makes in Russia.  PepsiCo is reluctant to shut its Russian unit, which includes a large dairy business it bought for about $5 billion a decade ago. In an email to staff on Tuesday, PepsiCo Chief Executive Ramon Laguarta wrote that the company has a responsibility to continue to operate there because tens of thousands of Russians depend on the company for their livelihoods and for daily essentials like milk and baby food. Revenue from PepsiCo 's Russian unit was $3.4 billion in 2021 -- a decline of 30% from its peak of $4.9 billion in 2013 -- making it the third-largest market for the company after the U.S. and Mexico. The impact of writing off the Russian unit would be minimal because it contributes little to PepsiCo 's earnings, some of the people familiar with the matter said.  PepsiCo has 20,000 employees in Russia. The bulk of its Russian business is Wimm-Bill-Dann , a dairy-and-juice company PepsiCo bought in 2011 for about $5 billion. Officials at PepsiCo 's highest levels have discussed the geopolitical crisis in the region nearly every day since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, some of the people familiar with the matter said. For weeks they have evaluated different scenarios of how the business may be affected by supply-chain and other financial challenges stemming from the conflict and what steps PepsiCo may need to take, one of the people said.  PepsiCo could write down the value of its Russian business to zero, modeling the process it used for its Venezuelan operations in 2015, some of the people said. The Venezuelan unit is still operating -- and PepsiCo still owns it -- but it doesn't contribute to the soda-and-snack giant's earnings.  PepsiCo could take this opportunity to write off a business that hasn't generated as much revenue as the company had hoped, some of the people said. At the same time, PepsiCo takes a long view on emerging markets, and doesn't want to lose the goodwill of shoppers there, current and former executives said. Pepsi was among the first American brands to take hold in the Soviet Union. In 1959, the company organized a booth at the American National Exhibition in Moscow. With the help of Vice President Richard Nixon, PepsiCo executive Don Kendall offered a glass to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, who agreed to several refills and declared it ""refreshing.""""  PepsiCo opened its first plant in the Soviet Union in 1974 after agreeing to a barter arrangement in which the beverage giant took its profit in Stolichnaya vodka."
466,1,Mitsubishi PH expands van production for export to ASEAN,305 words,Manila Bulletin,"MMPC President and CEO Takeshi Hara signed the Registration Agreement (RA) with PEZA as an ecozone export enterprise at the GAP-SEZ in Sta. Rosa, Laguna. Under the RA, MMPC is investing P585 million for its additional activity as manufacturer of motor vehicle -- L300 Right Hand Drive. It will also import materials, machinery, equipment, tools, goods, wares, articles, or merchandise for direct use in its registered operations at the GAP-SEZ. Plaza said MMPC started commercial operations in January this year and mass production by next week. The Japanese-owned car giant has also committed to start export in the third week of May this year to ASEAN countries. Accompanying MMPC President and CEO Hara during the signing were MMPC Executive Vice President of Corporate Division Takehisa Usami and MMPC Vice President of Legal and Government Affairs Atty. Imelda M. Abadilla-Brown. Currently, MMPC produces Mirage, Mirage G4 and Mitsubishi L-300 left-hand drive at the GAP-SEZ.  The Mirage car is MMPC's enrolled model in the government's Comprehensive Automotive Resurgence Strategy (CARS) program where it invested P4.3 billion for assembly and parts localization. Under the incentives-driven CARS, a participant is required to produce 200,000 units of its enrolled units over a 6-year period. The production of Mirage in the Philippines was expected to benefit 31 local businesses which were awarded to supply a total of 255 parts for the car."
333,0,"Japan to extend COVID quasi-emergency in 17 prefs., end it in 5",410 words,Kyodo News,"Shigeru Omi, the government's top COVID adviser, told a press conference after the panel's meeting that two of its members opposed the extension, saying the Omicron variant, which is said to cause no or mild symptoms, does not call for such restrictions. ""Remaining on guard, we will deal with the situation as we firmly keep the outlook in mind,"" Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said during a House of Representatives' Budget Committee meeting. Hitoshi Kikawada, senior vice minister at the Cabinet Office, told the panel that the 17 prefectures seeking extensions ""face the possibility of an increase in the number of patients with severe symptoms and need to reduce the burden on their health care systems."" Kikawada said the strain on hospitals had eased in the five other prefectures -- Yamagata, Shimane, Yamaguchi, Oita and Okinawa. The quasi-emergency measures are set to expire Sunday in 16 of the 17 prefectures and on Feb. 27 in Wakayama in western Japan. The remaining 13 prefectures are Hokkaido, Aomori, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Ishikawa, Nagano, Shizuoka, Hyogo, Okayama, Hiroshima, Saga and Kagoshima. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said at a news conference that experts believe the recent wave of infections has likely peaked, and the government plans to ""confirm the downtrends in the infection situation and the strain on hospitals"" in the extended two weeks. The government could lift the measures before the scheduled end date if the situation improves and local governors call for it. The quasi-emergency measures have been in place since January in many of the areas to prevent a surge in COVID-19 patients from overwhelming hospitals. The highly transmissible Omicron strain tends to cause no or mild symptoms. But elderly people and those with underlying health conditions are more likely to develop severe symptoms, requiring medical treatment. ==Kyodo"

454,1,"BUSINESS AS USUAL - Never mind robots, there is not enough tech talent available",900 words,Business Day,"""The biggest issue isnât that robots are taking all the jobs ï¿½?itâs that there arenât enough humans to take them,"" says the consulting firm.  Korn Ferryâs ""Future of Work"" series concluded that by 2030, there would be a global talent shortage of more than 85-million people, which could result in about $8.5-trillion in unrealised annual revenues. The savviest organisations are training talent themselves, increasing their hiring of people straight out of school, says Jean-Marc Laouchez, president of the Korn Ferry Institute. These firms are also trying to instil a continuous learning and training culture. ""Constant learning ï¿½?driven by both workers and organisation ï¿½?will be central to the future of work, extending far beyond the traditional definition of learning and development,"" he argues. In SA, the Covid pandemic forced many companies to embrace digital transformation, which quietly created demand for IT and tech talent. Capitec, SAâs third-biggest bank by market value, is on a hiring spree for IT and tech talent. On Tuesday, the bank told investors that its digital clients rose above 10-million in the 2022 financial year, which lifted its profits 84% to R8.4bn. Gerrie Fourie, Capitecâs boss, says the bankâs digital solutions have been crucial in enabling this growth. ""In addition, our staff have been instrumental in this adoption and have excelled in this new hybrid digital world.""  Capitec hired 1,367 new employees during the year, with 26% of new hires filling critical IT and data business development needs. Despite the pandemic, the business continues to grow and invest in its people and has already started recruiting top talent to fill 500 new positions in 2022. ""As SAâs leading digital bank, the group continued its strong hiring drive for specialists with the necessary data skills to align to our ambition of further accelerating our digital adoption. A total of 335 specialists were appointed during the year,"" says Fourie.  Capitecâs IT expenses are put at R1bn in 2022 compared to R700m earlier, largely due to increased investment in its digitalisation journey.  Capitec has introduced data and technology academies to ensure it accelerates the growth of all its employees, including specialists. It is not alone in searching for IT and tech specialists. Absa, FNB, MTN, Vodacom, ShopriteX, Amazon Web Services and Vantage Data Centers are recruiting top-flight candidates at unprecedented rates. Skills in software engineering, data science, cloud engineering, cybersecurity and machine learning are in demand. Six months ago, management consulting firm Monocle, which has offices in London and Amsterdam, announced its expansion into SA. Monocle also announced it was looking for tech talent. The company assists mostly large banks in SA and several prominent local insurers as a project execution partner. Other tech companies are also embarking on a hiring spree for scarce talent. In February, MTN SA revealed plans to hire 150 ""digital experts"" to meet the growing demand for digital services. Vodacom is searching for talent as it bulks up its financial services unit. Nedbank may also require more IT and tech skills as its super app Avo continues to gain traction. The fierce fight for scarce skills in SA is also influenced by the expansion of global data centres in the country. Tech giant Amazon Web Services continues to hire more people in SA. Meanwhile, Vantage Data Centers, a US-headquartered data centre specialist, plans to spend $1bn to build what it claims will be the largest data centre campus in Africa. Soon Vantage may seek to hire top IT and tech talent. Furthermore, retailers such as JSE-listed TFG and Shoprite are investing heavily in their digital transformation. Shoprite, SAâs largest retailer, has created 250 new jobs through its ShopriteX innovation hub, including jobs for data scientists and e-commerce and personalisation experts. While IT skills are in short supply, all is not lost. Global tech firms such as Huawei aim to help advance the ICT skills of more than 100,000 people across Sub-Saharan Africa within three years.  Capitec, Absa and others are also committed to training their employees in scarce skills. However, it is vital to note that while these training programmes offer hope of a medium- to long-term solution, they cannot answer the immediate pressing need for more IT and tech talent. The takeaway? Companies that fail to recruit and retain excellent tech talent are bound to lose their edge, cede ground to competitors and, in many cases, fade away, argues Bain & Company. ""Meanwhile, companies that adopt a winning talent strategy will have a powerful advantage thatâs just as critical to their success as the competitive moat created by their technology products."" Finally, one hopes Capitec can continue to transform banking through its high-calibre, diverse workforce hungry to make the bank succeed in the digital world.

Included in that was an $88 million backstop facility from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern that the Hong Kong group said it was due to draw down, but said that the German state imposed additional pre-conditions in December. The German government has said Genting Hong Kong had turned down aid that was offered to it. Genting's court case was heard by the regional court in the northern German town of Schwerin on Tuesday. A spokesman for the court said a ruling would be made on Monday at 2 p.m. local time (1300 GMT).  Genting Hong Kong also said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Tuesday that MV's insolvency led to defaults under its ""Global 1"" credit facility, which would in turn lead to further defaults on financing arrangements worth a total of around $2.8 billion. Shares in Genting Hong Kong have been suspended from trade since Friday. The company said they would continue to be suspended pending another announcement, which would include the outcome of legal proceedings.

843,1,"Africa poised for rapid private business formation, growth",1056 words,New Business Ethiopia,"The creation of a dedicated, purpose-led business and commercial client practice seeks to refine and focus Standard Bank's highly developed African business building abilities at a time at which local business formation across the continent is leading and sustaining the next phase of African growth. Sitting in South Africa with its own small and medium business development challenges, Africa doesn't always look like a natural home for successful business incubation. Looking further afield to East and West Africa, and more even broadly within our region, to Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Mozambique, however, a very different picture emerges. This continental view and ability is what Standard Bank's seasoned Africa-wide BCC team are harnessing to support business growth. Physically on the ground with experienced and capable workforces recruited and grown in-country, Standard Bank's BCC division supports full-service business banking operations in 15 African economies. This developed banking platform is directly supporting the emergence of domestic and regional businesses across the continent. The fact that Standard Bank has, for a long time, also been present in the development of the broader policy, legislative and infrastructure environments that give rise to independent business formation in Africa's emerging and frontier economies means BCC is ideally placed to lead the next wave of business formation on the continent. Whether clients are businesses evolving to support structured resource and infrastructure plays, or sole traders being equipped with the capital, networks and capabilities to become SMMEs or medium-sized enterprises, BCC has a clear view of how African businesses can grow, what is required to achieve this growth and what this growth will achieve for Africa. Growing small businesses into family enterprises or larger importer/exporter or wholesale distributor propositions, or eventually even into regional private and listed corporates, will sustain inclusive, privately-owned economic growth in Africa for generations to come. This will increase employment and broaden economic inclusion, creating the conditions for general prosperity and long term social and political stability. Critical to fostering this growth are the basic financial building blocks of independent capital formation especially control of one's own currency. The ability to manage and therefore predict the price of goods and services is essential for business formation. In Africa, micro, small and even medium sized businesses are routinely challenged by currency fluctuation. In these environments Standard Bank's presence, local balance sheets and access to finance is a critical for, especially, smaller businesses to insulate themselves from the cost and pricing volatility that often prevents their growth into larger and more stable operations. More broadly, as African businesses grow regionally and globally and foreign businesses and investors look to Africa, Standard Bank's reliable, present and capable counter-party banking structure on the continent will become increasingly important for Africa's emerging business segment. Standard Bank's now well-functioning working relationship with equity partner ICBC, unites Africa and the world's largest banks in a trade and finance capability ecosystem that, effectively, spans the globe. This is, daily, building the bridges, relationships and systems linking African businesses to the world along with a world of capital, investment and know-how to Africa. Despite the very real challenges that the continent continues to face, the learning of the recent past for Standard Bank is one of profound resilience and huge progress in Africa. Even in often difficult circumstances, the fact of Africa's astounding rise and growth is real. Standard Bank, however, is not alone in recognising the potential of the Africa's emerging businesses. Africa is home to many excellent domestic banks as well as world-class regional banks. In addition, Standard Bank faces, daily, intense competition from local fintech's and teleco ventures in every area from simple payments to complex cross border transactions. There is equally intense competition in the provision of credit and risk management. At the same time, most of the big global fintechs, like Apple Pay and Paypal, are also active on the continent. Faced with this competition, Standard Bank points to its hard-built physical presence, feet and infrastructure on the ground, local balance sheet and formidable digital capability spanning the continent. This established African ecosystem means that BCC has the right people, thought processes and relationships in place to support small and emerging regional businesses successfully navigate challenges and leverage the huge potential that the continent presents. In realising this potential, the role of technology cannot be overemphasised. For small and less well-capitalised businesses in particular, the sustained decrease in the cost of banking afforded by technology is a game changer. Technology, today, is the difference between survival and failure for businesses. Even simple things, like no longer having to go the bank on Saturdays to collect cash to pay staff has transformed many businesses. As technology increasingly frees up time and resources while reducing headcount and salary bills, otherwise marginal businesses are becoming increasingly viable especially in the critical first few years of startup and growth. Standard Bank's BCC division is resolutely committed to expanding the suit of both simple and complex technologies that are making ever more businesses possible in Africa. BCC has been assembled on the view that Africa is entering an exciting expansion phase, characterised by rapid private business formation and growth. As such, BCC will harness and focus Standard Bank's considerable business experience in tandem with its established African and global capital, knowledge and capability ecosystems to nurture and grow African businesses domestically, regionally and globally.

393,0,He doesn't need to butter anyone up,2158 words,The Boston Globe,"How did you end up at Alcove? To be honest, I was kind of dragging my feet a little bit in terms of finding something because, you know, with COVID, a chef with no sense of smell or taste is not really worth a lot. It's kind of like a pianist who has no use of his fingers. But [I heard] Tom Schlesinger-Guidelli was looking for somebody. I had always wanted to do sort of a fish-themed restaurant, and I've known him forever. It just seemed like a perfect fit. So I called him. I went in, and the place had such a really great vibe. I believe in the feel of a restaurant as soon as you walk in, and the feel was just very positive. The energy in everybody who worked there seemed really happy. The managers were awesome. So I just had this great vibe going in. If you know Tom, well, hospitality is in his bone marrow. He's the living embodiment of hospitality. So, you know, it's just a perfect fit. And I don't have to do a lot of the things that my own restaurant took me away from. I just basically have to focus on cooking. As somebody who's been in this industry in Boston a long time, what's going to happen to restaurants over the next year? Well, the thing that people don't really talk about that much is that it wasn't an easy business before COVID. Restaurants closed all the time, so there was that. Staffing has been nearly impossible for a long time. [At Erbaluce], we couldn't get a steady bartender. We had one in the very beginning, but it was nearly impossible to staff to begin with. And then COVID has made it so that a lot of people have taken a break. It's a cliche now, but they've taken a break and realized they don't want to stay in the restaurant business. A lot of my cooks I called to talk to, they're like, 'Well, we're making better money and better hours doing construction or driving trucks or something.' So there's that. ï¿½?Deliveries are difficult. But you know, even before COVID, a lot of my purveyors couldn't find people to drive trucks to make deliveries. COVID amplified the problems that were already there. What does all this mean for customers reading this? New restaurants are always going to open, right? Because every time a young cook gets into a kitchen, they're looking to gain experience, and they're looking to gain a client base, and hopefully some investors to open. There's always going to be investors, or people with money, who are looking to invest to have their favorite spot. And then there's always going to be new people coming in from other fields, whether they've been investment bankers, or lawyers or whatever, who have a dream of owning a restaurant. That's the problem a lot of times. Because they don't know the business, they have unrealistic expectations of the finances. So they're willing to sign leases for higher rent than they should, and higher rent than the business can sustain. So then everybody else is like, 'Well, this is the going rate.' Really, $100 a square foot? There's no way you can make that. 'Well, you know, Joe Blow is willing to pay it.' I'm like, yeah, but that's a commodities trader with a black Amex. They don't understand the business. So what does that mean for the Boston restaurant scene? To be honest with you ï¿½?I said years ago to another writer, and she thought I was crazy ï¿½?but I said, in a handful of years, Boston's going to basically be chain restaurants. You're going to have large corporate chains who can afford the rent because they have outlets in other cities with much lower rents; they can defray the cost. Do you still believe it? I think I'm a little more optimistic that the one-off or private restaurants or locally owned restaurants have a fighting chance in terms of competition. But still, the thing is the rents. It's just unrealistic, and landlords, with commercial real estate, would rather see their places sit fallow than to charge a reasonable rent. Now, when I say reasonable rent, over the last 10 or 15 years, the commercial real estate has gone up 10 times the rate of inflation. So it's much more where inflation has been going up, except for recently, but it's been an average of 1.6, under 2 percent a year. Landlords have been charging double, triple, quadruple their rents on renewals. I looked at one space when we opened our restaurant, 12 years ago, 13 years ago; it was $8,000 a month, and then it went to $45,000 a month after the 10-year lease. And then the landlord wouldn't renew for less than $65,000 a month. Well, it's impossible to pay that. That's the biggest issue: commercial real estate, and nobody can live around the city anymore. People working in restaurants used to live in Eastie. They can't anymore, so they're way down the South Shore, North Shore. The trains don't run late enough. The T closes too early. So, if you have a 2 a.m. license, you can't get your employees home. Maybe bartenders can afford an Uber but, you know, dishwashers, bus people, barbacks? They can't afford that. So that's been a problem. But that's been a problem for 35 years, since I moved to Boston. What about opening restaurants in the suburbs? I was never a big proponent of moving a restaurant to the suburbs. ï¿½?You don't have an early crowd, really, and you don't have later crowd. You have that 7:30 Saturday night, and that's it. That's your seating. So trying to get people on a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday is hard, and it's done by 9. In the restaurant business, margins are so slim, that it's the pre-theater and post-theater rush. Those things pay your bills. You can actually make money. But, if you do just one giant seating where you're packed but only for an hour, it's very hard to make a living that way. You need three seatings. ï¿½?But, at the same time, it used to be people went to the suburbs because you could get cheaper rents. But now you can be a half-hour outside of the city, and they're charging rents like they're in Boston. It's not that cheap. Let's talk about butter. I was told you don't cook with butter. That's kind of been my thing for a long time. I started to ease off of butter. At my restaurant and at Marcuccio's, I cooked completely without butter. What I found was, as I eased up on the butter, all the other flavors came out more. Some people think I have this thing against butter. I love butter. I put it on my toast in the morning. But, the amounts of butter that most restaurants use, I just did away with that. And you can taste everything. The thing is, a lot of chefs will say butter is flavor, right? You hear that all the time, but what happens is the butter first mutes the flavor. It just sits on top of it. And then you have to add a lot more salt to get the flavor of the food back up over the butter. If you take a recipe and you cook it straight out, it could be the same recipe, and at the end, you put a big spoon of butter, you now have to add 5 to 10 times as much salt to get the flavor back out over the butter. So you wind up with basically salty butter with some other flavors in there. On a night off, you're going someplace to eat just for taste, you know, just because it's delicious. Where you go, invariably, is Asian restaurants, or Middle Eastern food, or Central American, or all these places along that Equatorial belt that don't use butter. It's always some cuisine that doesn't use butter at all. But yet, butter is flavor, right? You never hear a chef say, 'You know what I really love is Norwegian cuisine!' Or, you know, 'The Bavarians really have their finger on the pulse.' You don't hear that. So what are you cooking at Alcove? I'm trying to keep it simple New England. Local fishermen, local farms, and I'm taking things they already have and just amplifying them. They had a good bar burger. But now I put on the best beef in the city. It's Painted Hills. I season some beef fat and fold it into the burger with thyme and black pepper. Now it's a really juicy burger. One of the best in the city, fantastic. I'm making some small changes like that. Is it hard to go from owning a place to working for someone else? It's so easy. Because so many of the things that took me away from cooking don't exist anymore. I can just focus on the food. When you own a place, between licensing, and getting investor calls, and all that kind of stuff? Cooking was a small percentage of it. Now, I can just focus on the food. I've been working seven days. And there's a young guy there who says, 'Oh, God, you're working so much.' You have no idea how easy this is. It's like retirement. But you can only do that if you're working with somebody who has your same mindset. I couldn't work with somebody who's like, 'OK, it's all about profit. Let's get the cheapest stuff and pretend it's good.' Tom's like, 'If it costs me extra, I don't care. I want really good stuff.' We want to support local farmers; we want to support local fishermen, all stuff I've been doing forever. When I moved to Boston 35 years ago, the farmers' market was at Government Center. It was Noquochoke Farms and a guy selling used books. That was the farmers' market. I'd buy as many apples as Noquochoke could give me, and I'd buy parsnips from them, and that was it. Tom's younger than me, but he kind of grew up with that mentality. He grew up in the business. You know, I'm Italian. So anything that people use for bait normally is what we have for dinner. Like whelks. I just put them on and people are like, 'Wow, we didn't know you could eat these things.' Nobody's serving whelks. Maybe a couple places in Chinatown, but I like doing that. And Tom loves it. Most missed restaurant? Tavern Road was great; consistently great. And Louis DiBiccari was awesome. And then he had Tony Susi in there with him. You couldn't get a bad meal in there if you tried. Favorite restaurant now? I don't really go out that much. But Giulia is just ï¿½?they're always knocking it out of the park there. Best pizza in the city? That's tough, because the thing with pizza is always about the oven being hot. ... The original [Pizzeria] Regina has a coal-fired oven that gets hot enough. ... But I would say Picco, because their oven gets hot enough. Picco's good. Upper Crust is good, too, but too much garlic. Takeout Chinese? Peach Farm. I love the owners. I love what they do. It's always Peach Farm. Interview was edited and condensed. Kara Baskin can be reached at kara.baskin@globe.com. Credit: By Kara Baskin GLOBE CORRESPONDENT"

824,0,"Exclusive-In heated meeting, India seeks tougher action from U.S. tech giants on fake news",716 words,Reuters News,"The sources, who were familiar with the proceedings at the virtual meeting on Monday, described the conversation as tense and heated, signalling a new low in ties between American tech giants and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration. The officials did not issue any ultimatum to the companies at the meeting, the sources said. The government has been tightening tech sector regulations but wants companies to do more on content moderation. The meeting was a follow-up to the I&B ministry's use of ""emergency powers"" in December and January to order the blocking of 55 channels on Google's YouTube platform, and some Twitter and Facebook accounts The government had said the channels were promoting ""fake news"" or ""anti-India"" content and that the disinformation was being spread by accounts based in neighbouring Pakistan. The I&B ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the meeting, which was also attended by Indian content-sharing platforms ShareChat and Koo, which have millions of users in the country.  Facebook, now known as Meta, Twitter and ShareChat declined comment. Without commenting on the meeting, Alphabet Inc's Google said in a statement it reviews governmentâs requests and âwhere appropriate, we restrict or remove content in keeping with local laws.ï¿½?Koo said it complies with local laws and has strong content moderation practices in place. In its transparency reports, Twitter has said the Indian government makes among the highest number of requests to remove content from its platform. Technology website Comparitech in October said India made 97,631 content removal requests in 2020, the second-highest in the world after Russia, mostly to Facebook and Google. STRAINED TIES During the meeting, senior tech executives told the officials that they take adequate measures to remove or curb the spread of misinformation on their platforms, and act on legally-valid content removal requests, said the sources. The officials told Google to review its internal guidelines to remove fake content automatically, said the sources. The officials also said the government was disappointed that big social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, weren't detecting and removing such content on their own. Instead, the government was forced to order takedowns, opening it to criticism and damaging its public image, the officials said during the meeting, according to the sources. Executives from Google told the I&B officials that one way to resolve that was for the ministry to avoid making takedown decisions public. The firms could work with the government and act on the alleged fake content, which could be a win-win for both sides, Google said, according to one of the sources. The idea was summarily rejected by the government officials, who said the takedowns also publicise how the companies weren't doing enough to tackle fake news on their own, the person said. While ordering takedowns of certain online accounts in January, the government said it was doing so to ""secure the overall information environment in India"", adding that such fake content was on ""sensitive subjects"" such as the Indian Army, India's foreign relations and local state elections. Digital rights advocates say such government orders curb free speech and set a worrying precedent. ""Detailed takedown orders are not made public by the government,"" said Apar Gupta, the executive director at Internet Freedom Foundation, adding that the basis for the action was not explained. This allowed authorities to censor content even if it does not violate public order or the security of the state, he said.

Our direct sales expansion into one of the largest medical device markets in the world is just one of many new initiatives intended to drive our core growth overall."" About CytoSorbents Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSO)  CytoSorbents Corporation is a leader in the treatment of life-threatening conditions in intensive care and cardiac surgery using blood purification. Its flagship product, CytoSorbÂ®, is approved in the European Union with distribution in more than 70 countries around the world as an extracorporeal cytokine adsorber designed to reduce the ""cytokine storm"" or ""cytokine release syndrome"" seen in common critical illnesses that may result in massive inflammation, organ failure and patient death. These are conditions where the risk of death can be extremely high, yet few to no effective treatments exist. CytoSorb is also being used during and after cardiothoracic surgery to remove inflammatory mediators that can lead to post-operative complications, including multiple organ failure. More than 162,000 cumulative CytoSorb devices have been utilized as of December 31, 2021. CytoSorb was originally introduced into the European Union under CE-Mark as a first-in-kind cytokine adsorber. Additional CE-Mark label expansions were received for the removal of bilirubin and myoglobin in clinical conditions such as liver disease and trauma, respectively, and both ticagrelor and rivaroxaban during cardiothoracic surgery. CytoSorb has also received FDA Emergency Use Authorization in the United States for use in adult critically ill COVID-19 patients with imminent or confirmed respiratory failure. The DrugSorbï¿½?ATR Antithrombotic Removal System, which is based on the same polymer technology as CytoSorb, has also been granted FDA Breakthrough Designation for the removal of ticagrelor, as well as FDA Breakthrough Designation for the removal of the direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) drugs, apixaban and rivaroxaban, in a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit during urgent cardiothoracic surgery. The Company has initiated two FDA approved pivotal trials designed to support U.S. marketing approval of DrugSorb-ATR. The first is the 120-patient, 20 center STAR-T (Safe and Timely Antithrombotic Removal-Ticagrelor) randomized, controlled trial evaluating the ability of intraoperative DrugSorb-ATR use to reduce perioperative bleeding risk in patients on ticagrelor undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. The second is the 120-patient, 25 center STAR-D (Safe and Timely Antithrombotic Removal-Direct Oral Anticoagulants) randomized, controlled trial, evaluating the intraoperative use of DrugSorb-ATR to reduce perioperative bleeding risk in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery on direct oral anticoagulants, including apixaban and rivaroxaban.  CytoSorbents' purification technologies are based on biocompatible, highly porous polymer beads that can actively remove toxic substances from blood and other bodily fluids by pore capture and surface adsorption.

909,0,How ProPublica and The Post researched the postings of Facebook groups,898 words,The Washington Post,"Many of these groups disappeared from public view during the period of our analysis. To determine when groups focused on U.S. politics within our data set went offline, we analyzed the more than 5,000 groups that had meaningful activity (more than 10 posts tracked) but were no longer online as of Aug. 30, 2021. We hand-labeled each group as political if its name and description showed that it was created to represent or support a U.S. political interest or group, to be a forum for U.S. political speech, or to represent or discuss a social or cultural movement with a strong connection to U.S. politics (national or local). We ultimately found more than 2,500 such groups, including those for and against various parties, candidates and issues across the political spectrum; groups for various kinds of political memes and discussions; and groups for movements such as the QAnon extremist ideology, militia groups and Stop the Steal. We then estimated the time of disappearance for each of these 2,500-plus U.S. political groups by taking the latest date seen on their posts and other group activity. Based on our reporting and the timing of spikes in group disappearances, which often coincided with Facebook's announcements of group suspensions, we believe the majority of them were removed by Facebook. However, some may have been deleted or removed from public view by their own administrators. We shared the list of more than 2,500 groups with Facebook and asked it to clarify whether they were removed by the company or taken offline by their own administrators. Facebook did not respond to our questions about these groups or any other of our quantitative findings. We used these labeled offline groups to predict which of the still-online groups within our sample were also U.S. political groups. We used posts from the offline groups to train a text classification model to predict whether a post was from a U.S. political group and ran it against all the posts from each group in our data set. We labeled a group as a likely U.S. political Facebook group when the mean prediction for its posts was over 0.5 (1.0 indicates that the model predicts with maximum probability that the post is from a U.S. political group). We used this labeling method to identify over 27,000 likely U.S. political groups with posts between Election Day and Jan 6. We hand-checked a sample of the groups to calculate an estimate of the proportion of groups that were actually U.S. political groups, and got a precision rate of about 79 percent. To count the number of posts that specifically sought to delegitimize the election results, we examined 18.7 million posts from Election Day through Jan. 6 within the likely U.S. political Facebook groups. We separated out posts from groups with ""Stop the Steal"" in their name and calculated which keywords and phrases were disproportionately common in posts from those groups using a text-analysis technique called TF-IDF. Then, we handpicked the terms and keywords that were meaningfully linked to election delegitimization theories (e.g., ""stop the steal,"" ""steal the election,"" ""every legal vote""). We had about 60 terms that indicated delegitimization on their own, plus 86 more in two buckets that, if terms from both buckets were present, indicated delegitimization (e.g., a reference to absentee ballots on its own did not indicate delegitimization, but a reference to ""absentee ballots"" and ""fraud"" did.) We identified about 1.03 million posts that likely referenced delegitimization. Finally, we hand-checked a sample of these posts to estimate the proportion that actually sought to delegitimize the election, and got a precision rate of about 64 percent. (False positives included mainstream news articles, debunks of fraud claims, and references to other countries' elections.) We arrived at our final estimate of delegitimizing posts by multiplying the two together, to get an estimate of a bit more than 655,000. Because of CounterAction's sampling method, the groups we analyzed are likely to contain a greater proportion of right-wing groups than the platform as a whole. The activity of the right-wing groups we analyzed matches with the findings of our reporting, and group activity in our sample coincided with Facebook's public announcements about group removals.

762,0,Korean zombie drama becomes latest victim of piracy in China,487 words,Korea Times,"Netflix's new zombie apocalypse series, 'All of Us Are Dead,' the third Korean show to top the streaming giant's global chart since its debut on Jan. 28, has become the latest victim of piracy and illegal distribution in China. In Taobao, one of the biggest online shopping platforms in the country, a pirated copy of the horror series, renamed 'Zombie Campus' in Mandarin, is currently being sold for the price of 5 Chinese yuan, or around 1,000 won ($0.84). Already purchased more than 2,000 times, the video can be downloaded via a file-sharing service, with Mandarin subtitles provided. As Netflix remains unavailable in China, it is understood that businesses and individuals there have been cashing in on the popularity of the hit series by downloading the high-quality clips illegally through VPNs. All of the drama's episodes have also been made available for free through dozens of unofficial streaming services and the popular microblogging platform, Weibo. In Douban, the largest social networking website in China that allows users to submit ratings of films, dramas and books, over 58,000 reviews have been uploaded for the zombie series. 'All of Us Are Dead' is not the first Korean original series to fall victim to rampant illegal distribution and sales in China. The global sensation, 'Squid Game,' gained a massive following in the country after pirated DVDs became available and local businesses and vendors further profited from the dystopian thriller through selling thematic merchandise. 'Hellbound,' 'Space Sweepers' and 'Kingdom: Ashin of the North' form just a fraction of the Korean content released in 2021 that has become subject to piracy. The pirating of 'All of Us Are Dead' comes at a time when anti-China sentiment is already on the rise in Korea, due to Beijing's string of claims to the cultural heritage of its neighboring country, including Korean traditional dress, hanbok, and its fermented side dish, kimchi. The ongoing 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics has seen such cultural conflicts escalate even further. During last week's opening ceremony for the Games, one of the performers representing an ethnic Korean minority of China and carrying the Chinese national flag caused a stir for donning hanbok as national dress. This controversy was followed by what many Koreans saw as an 'unfair' decision during the short track speed skating competitions on Monday, when two Korean athletes, Hwang Dae-heon and Lee June-seo ï¿½?who came in first and second, respectively, in different groups for the men's 1,000-meter semifinals ï¿½?were disqualified. These penalties, which led to China collecting gold and silver in the finals, enraged many Koreans over what they believe to be a biased ruling in favor of the host country."

772,0,Spotify Chooses Profits Over Truth,1025 words,The New York Times,"In recent days several well-known musicians have protested Spotify's enormously popular podcast ''The Joe Rogan Experience,'' in which Mr. Rogan has, among other things, irresponsibly promoted ivermectin, used to treat parasitic infections, as a Covid treatment, and protested vaccine requirements. And when his guests have offered up gobs of bad information about Covid and vaccine efficacy, he has offered up too little pushback. After hundreds of medical experts signed an open letter to Spotify denouncing such disinformation, the singer Neil Young issued an ultimatum to Spotify: ''They can have Neil Young or Rogan. Not both.'' Joni Mitchell soon followed, as did others like the Spotify podcaster BrenÃ© Brown, who vowed over the weekend not to release new episodes of her shows ''Unlocking Us'' and ''Dare to Lead.'' Rather than give in to critics, Spotify has held its ground and, in recent days, most of Mr. Young's and Ms. Mitchell's music has been pulled from its library. The service said suppressing or editing Mr. Rogan's podcast would amount to censorship -- but anyone who's paid attention to online content moderation knows that's a charade. Facebook, in particular, has trotted out that excuse time and again when it ought to have blocked or removed content or users. Don't be fooled. Peer just beneath the surface and it becomes clear that for big social media companies, matters of ''censorship'' are always matters of business. Facebook, for example, has had special exemptions from its rules for the very people who are most likely to be believed: politicians and celebrities. More such speech, more advertising revenue.  Facebook, Twitter and YouTube remove content posted by regular folks every day with no apparent worries about grand matters of free speech. Removing accounts by Donald Trump and, more recently, Marjorie Taylor Greene after repeated and flagrant policy violations was done only when it became a business imperative. If, as Spotify implies, Mr. Rogan's views offend its sensibilities, there ought to be nothing to prevent the service from scaling his podcast back. As the exclusive rights holder for the podcast, it has more control over and responsibility for Mr. Rogan's content than do social media companies over users who post Covid misinformation. But Spotify paid dearly for Mr. Rogan's podcast (a reported $100 million) and the will of two rockers past their primes and a few others, does not -- from a business perspective -- outweigh Mr. Rogan's 11 million regular listeners. Mr. Rogan has expressed contrition and vowed to more carefully vet his guests. Spotify, for its part, said it will post warning labels on his content and that of others directly discussing Covid. But that's all window dressing. Twitter and Facebook's experiments with warning labels and links to authoritative sources proved unable to stop the spread of misinformation during the 2020 election and haven't been effective in culling similarly dangerous ideas in the pandemic. In a Sunday blog post that did not include any mention of Mr. Rogan or his podcast, Spotify's chief executive, Daniel Ek, appears to take a strong stance against violations of the service's rules. Still, he resisted calls to take more muscular action. ''There are plenty of individuals and views on Spotify that I disagree with strongly,'' Mr. Ek wrote. ''We have a critical role to play in supporting creator expression while balancing it with the safety of our users. In that role, it is important to me that we don't take on the position of being content censor.'' Whatever Spotify executives' true feelings about Mr. Rogan or the pandemic, Mr. Ek is really playing defense for his cash cow -- and if he gives in on this issue he'll have to give in on the next one and the next one after that. Handed an opening, there's no shortage of customers and artists who'd be thrilled to pressure the company to remove content from Barack and Michelle Obama's production company, which has its own exclusive deal with Spotify. Losing Joni Mitchell is a shame, but losing Mr. Rogan or Mr. Obama would be terrible for business, whatever nonsense either may spew. Investors have rewarded the strategy. Shares of Spotify are up more than 15 percent since Mr. Young's music started being taken off the service last week, even amid what was the worst start to the year in over a decade for the broader market. Mr. Ek's blog post laid out the company's rules of the road, but Spotify knew exactly who Mr. Rogan was when it signed its exclusive deal with him nearly two years ago. Before reaching the deal, Mr. Rogan had belittled transgender people, given airtime to Alex Jones and once likened a movie theater in a predominantly Black neighborhood as akin to ''Planet of the Apes.'' Spotify knew what it was getting with Mr. Rogan. If its ''longstanding platform rules'' truly mattered or were being applied consistently, you'd expect Mr. Rogan to have already been dealt with. Where the rubber meets the road for Spotify is a market backlash, a principled stance from bigger names like Taylor Swift, as some have suggested, or a slew of artists, not the trickle we've seen so far. So, for now, Mr. Rogan is untouchable and our health is at risk. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Announces That a Class Action Lawsuit Has Been Filed Against Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc. and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm",586 words,Business Wire,"Click here to participate in the action. In October 2021, the Company completed its IPO, selling 7,690,400 shares of Class A common stock at $19.00 per share. On March 29, 2022, after the market closed, Stronghold announced its fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results. The Company reported a net loss of $0.52 for the quarter, below analyst estimates of $0.04 earnings per share, and Stronghold's Chief Executive Officer cited ""significant headwinds in our operations which have materially impacted recent financial performance.""

789,0,Did Hackers Get an Early Look At Earnings of 165+ Companies? -- Barron's,1694 words,Dow Jones Institutional News,"Hackers may have found a new way to get their hands on inside information for stock trading. Two indictments unsealed Dec. 20 in Boston's federal court allege that a group led by a Russian cybersecurity executive stole early looks at unannounced earnings -- making over $82 million trading ahead of unreleased announcements from Tesla (ticker: TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM), and over 165 other companies. But Vladislav Klyushin and his four co-defendants aren't alleged to have hacked those companies. Instead, prosecutors charge that the hackers targeted a little-known choke point for market-moving information: two firms that thousands of public companies use to make electronic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It's one of the largest hackings of inside information on stocks ever charged, and the case is likely to shine an uncomfortable light on an obscure but crucial industry that handles the market's most-sensitive information. Charging documents from the Department of Justice, and a parallel civil case by the SEC, conceal the names of the two filing services. The SEC complaint describes ""Servicer A"" as a Chicago-based company, and ""Servicer B"" as a division of a foreign company. Barron's was able to determine that Servicer A is Chicago-based Donnelley Financial Solutions (DFIN), while Servicer B is the Toppan Merrill unit of Japan's Toppan (TOPPY). That's because the SEC's public archive, known as Edgar, has digital copies of the earnings announcements mentioned in the criminal case, and each filing names the responsible filing service. Federal prosecutors in Boston allege that the Klyushin group stole computer passwords from the filing agents' employees and then roamed the firms' networks from 2017 through 2020 to steal copies of more than 500 unannounced earnings drafts. After his arrest in Switzerland and extradition to Boston, Klyushin pleaded not guilty at his Jan. 5 arraignment before U.S. Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler. The judge declined to release him on bail. His co-defendants remain at large and aren't represented in court. Toppan Merrill acknowledged to Barron's that it is one of the filing agents described in the indictments of the hacking ring. ""Toppan Merrill has been cooperating fully with government authorities in support of their investigations in this matter,"" the company's general counsel Lisa Bilcik wrote in an email. ""We have communicated with the limited set of customers whose information was allegedly accessed and used in the illegal trading scheme."" Toppan Merrill declined to comment further. Donnelley Financial did not respond to repeated requests for comment, and it has never publicly spoken about the hacking cases. On its website, DFIN -- as Donnelley Financial now styles itself -- tells potential customers that its ActiveDisclosure system is secure. ""Unsurpassed security gives you peace of mind,"" says the website. ""At DFIN, we successfully handle some of the most sensitive documents in the world thanks to our best-in-class security architecture and fraud detection solutions."" Donnelley Financial and Toppan Merrill are remnants of a once-thriving financial printing industry, relied upon by Wall Street to confidentially prepare the prospectuses, proxies, and sensitive announcements of public companies. As ink and paper gave way to electronic files, financial printers evolved into software suppliers hired by public companies and investment funds to securely format and submit the SEC filings that contain some of the most actionable trading information on the planet. The Donnelley Financial business was spun off in 2016 from R.R. Donnelley & Sons (RRD) -- the 150-year-old Chicago firm that had been America's largest printer, producing catalogs for Sears Roebuck and magazines for Time Inc. The first-known infiltration of the filing agent's systems was in October 2017, according to prosecutors: a year after Donnelley Financial first traded on the New York Stock Exchange for $28 a share. Nearly every public company now uses the software systems of three firms: Donnelley Financial, Toppan Merrill, or the Ames, Iowa--based Workiva (WK). At Workiva, the filing firm that wasn't involved with the alleged hacks, chief information security officer, Eric Anders, expressed sympathy for his rivals. ""Let's be clear,"" he blogged, after the unsealing of the hacking case, ""[N]o company is completely immune to attack, and anyone who promises otherwise is lying."" In a March 2021 affidavit filed by prosecutors to obtain Klyushin's arrest warrant, Federal Bureau of Investigation agent B.J. Kang alleged that the hacking group penetrated one of the filing agents in November 2018 and used inside information to buy or sell short shares of its clients, including IBM, Avnet (AVT), Steel Dynamics (STLD), and 3M (MMM). Public filings at the SEC show that those firms were clients of Toppan Merrill. Infiltration of the second filing agent began in 2017, Kang alleged, allowing the conspirators to trade ahead of the announcements of a long list of that filing service's customers, which included Tesla, Grubhub, Nielsen Holdings (NLSN), Kohl's (KSS), Hexcel (HXL), Roku (ROKU), HubSpot (HUBS), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), and Snap (SNAP). The SEC Edgar database shows that Donnelley Financial was the filing agent for those companies, and dozens of others mentioned in the FBI affidavit. Barron's queried the public companies whose announcements were alleged to have been stolen. Only Nielsen Holdings would comment, saying that the charges unsealed in December were its first notice of the alleged inside trading. Nielsen says it has asked for more information from its filing agent, Donnelley Financial. One of the four co-defendants alleged to have carried out the intrusions, Ivan Yermakov (or ""Ermakov""), worked for Klyushin's Moscow-based cybersecurity firm, M-13, prosecutors say. The 35-year-old Yermakov, they say, is a veteran of the Russian military intelligence agency known by the initials GRU. While at GRU, according to a 2018 federal indictment, Yermakov infiltrated the computers of the Democratic Party and the campaign of Hillary Clinton, ahead of the 2016 elections. A second indictment in 2018 charged him with hacking antidoping agencies, sports federations, and antidoping officials, as well as the nuclear reactor unit of Westinghouse Electric, the international agency against chemical weapons, and a lab that had investigated suspected Russian poisonings in the United Kingdom. Yermakov remains at large, and no charges were lodged against M-13. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Yermakov in 2018 for his alleged hacking of the 2016 election, and an FBI wanted poster seeks him for the election and sports-doping-related charges. No attorney has appeared for him in any of the U.S. proceedings, including the recent stock trading cases. Yermakov appears never to have commented publicly on his U.S. indictments, and his social media accounts were closed down after the first case filings. The M-13 cybersecurity firm where Klyushin employed Yermakov is hired by its clients to attempt computer attacks in an exercise known as penetration testing, according to its website. The website listed clients that include Russian government agencies and the office of President Vladimir Putin. In June 2020, Putin awarded Klyushin a national medal of honor. M-13 did not respond to requests for comment. Klyushin's activities have left him well off, say prosecutors. In arguing that he posed a flight risk if released on bail, prosecutors presented photos they say Klyushin sent Yermakov, showing a safe with an estimated $3 million in $100 bills. Klyushin has a $2 million London apartment and a $4 million yacht, according to court filings. The attorney representing Klyushin in the federal criminal case did not respond to queries. Letters to Judge Bowler, purporting to come from Klyushin's employees, praised Klyushin's fairness and generosity, saying that he paid their medical bills and took them on retreats to resorts like the Russian city of Sochi. He paid to repair the roof of Moscow's Sretensky Monastery, said one writer, and loved pets and nature. ""I can't imagine a situation in which Vladislav could hurt someone or wish evil,"" wrote his second wife, Zhannetta Kliushina. ""Vladislav cannot commit what he is accused of."" Previous criminal cases have charged overseas hackers with stealing advance knowledge of market-moving information from public relations newswires, the SEC itself, or from merger-and-acquisition lawyers. Only the illicit gains alleged in the newswires case exceeded the $82.5 million that Klyushin and his co-defendants are charged with reaping. According to the latest federal charges, Yermakov stole log-in credentials from employees of the two filing agents and installed malware that allowed him to query their networks from over 100 rotating, anonymous internet addresses associated with locations around the world. He had bought and established the fictitious addresses using cryptocurrency to cover his tracks, say prosecutors. Klyushin and others allegedly traded on the stolen information in the hours and days before the announcements became public. A statistical analysis by the SEC claims that the probability that the group would have traded as it did around the companies' earnings -- by chance alone -- is one in a trillion. In prosecutors' filings, they cite an array of evidence that includes photos and text messages exchanged by Klyushin, Yermakov, and their associates, as well as trading records from Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR) and brokers in the U.K., Denmark, Russia, Cyprus, and Portugal. None of the brokers have been accused of wrongdoing. 4 Feb 2022 21:30 ET Did Hackers Get an Early Look At Earnings of 165+ -2- In a June 2020 exchange of texts, prosecutors say, Yermakov told Klyushin that they needed to go to work to make money to buy an apartment. Klyushin responded that there was no need to do that, because they just had to ""turn on the computer"" to make money, according to prosecutors.

But the world's largest alternative asset manager - with $US881 billion ($1.2 trillion) in assets under management across private equity, real estate, debt and infrastructure - has considerable experience buying, overhauling and selling casinos across Las Vegas, Europe and Latin America. Casino industry analyst Ben Lee, who runs the consultancy IGamiX, said Blackstone first step would be to parachute in a team of American executives and start cutting costs. ""They've got no interest in running casinos long term,"" Mr Lee said. ""So they will slash and burn, they will cut costs and make it very lean, fix it up, and then sell it off."" Blackstone bought the Cosmopolitan casino and hotel on the Las Vegas Strip in 2014 for $US1.8 billion, spent about $US500 million sprucing it up and then sold it for $US5.65 billion in September last year. Blackstone owns two other hotels in Nevada's famed Sin City - the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay (bought for $US4.6 billion in 2020) and the Bellagio (bought for $US4.25 billion in 2019) - as well as Spanish gambling outfit Cirsa, which has 147 casinos globally, mostly in Latin America. Blackstone also has a track record of turning around hotels and hospitality businesses: it owned Hilton Worldwide for 11 years before selling it in 2018 at a $US14 billion profit - triple its initial investment. Last year the firm bought a controlling stake in UK domestic holiday market leader Bourne Leisure, US hotel operator Extended Stays, and a portfolio of eight Japanese hotels. The Chinese high-roller market Crown spent years pursuing has been sidelined by the banning of ""junket"" tour operators in NSW and Victoria after the Age, Sydney Morning Herald and 60 Minutes revealed many were linked to international crime rings. Mr Lee said that meant Blackstone will be more focused on local customers, particularly by luring rival The Star Sydney's domestic VIP gamblers across to the new Crown Sydney tower at Barangaroo. Forager Funds' chief investment officer Steve Johnson, whose fund has a small shareholding in Crown, said Blackstone would probably refinance the company with higher levels of debt than equity markets were comfortable with, and then split Crown's property assets off from the operating business. ""If you can separate those two things you'll get more combined value,"" Mr Johnson said. ""They've got experience running these assets, but my guess is that in 10 years' time they probably don't want to own either."" Blackstone leases its two remaining Las Vegas casinos out to MGM International to operate in a model analyst and investors say it could pursue here by bringing The Star in to run the Crown properties. Chris Tynan, Blackstone Australia's senior managing director and head of real estate, said in a statement on Monday that Crown played a ""pivotal role in Australia's economy through job creation, investment and as a tourism destination for locals and visitors alike"". ""We are excited to bring our local expertise and global hospitality and gaming experience to contribute to Australia's post-pandemic recovery and position Crown for future growth,"" he said.

89,1,"She lost her house, sold her car and gave herself untold stress during the...",1144 words,Rochdale Observer,"âItâs been a rollercoaster. Iâd been thinking about it for a while, and for anyone who has stopped doing anything, whether a job or a relationship, itâs so weird when you say the words out loud,ï¿½?says the Glasgow-born presenter, reflecting on leaving Loose Women in late 2020 after 13 years. Despite the hard times, Andrea is now showing others how to tame their fears and create the changes they want ï¿½?in her new self-help book, You Just Need To Believe It, in which she charts how to unlock your courage and reclaim power in your life. She shares her personal journey, along with steps on how people can learn to believe in themselves and live the lives they want, with exercises including visualisation and journaling and guidance on sticking with habit changes and turning to friends. Mother-of-two Andrea has practised what she preaches, switching careers and now planning winters in sunnier climes with Nick. âOur second biggest market is America, so we are making plans to spend a few months of the year there. Weâve earmarked Miami,ï¿½?she explains. âI donât want to spend any more winters in England. Iâm 52 and weâve got about 30 summers left. Do I want to spend them wishing I was somewhere else, or do I want to be somewhere else? Our ultimate goal is to move to Florida for winters and France for summers. Weâve booked it for next year.ï¿½?This âcan doï¿½?attitude and sense of taking control of her life is evident in the book. âPeople ask if Iâd go back to TV, and yes, of course, if it suited me, but my plans are different now. Itâs about living in a way that suits me,ï¿½?she says. After leaving Loose Women, Andrea worked 15-hour days on her business ï¿½?but at one point, she was so stressed that her left eye kept twitching, her jaw hurt from clenching her teeth during what little sleep she got, and her skin was sore to the touch. Technical issues meant the launch of the This Girl Is On Fire app was months behind schedule and they needed more funds to move things forwards, while publicity jobs sheâd been counting on as a financial buffer dropped off as she was no longer on TV. âThe day we realised we had to put our home on the market was a dark one,ï¿½?she recalls in the book. They moved from their Surrey home the week before Christmas, and both had Covid at the time. That period put a strain on her marriage, Andrea admits. âBut because of everything Iâve been through in my bumpy life, Iâve learned what works for me and what doesnât. My go-to is to go very quiet and not say anything, and Iâve realised through burning out that thatâs a really stupid idea. âIâm able now to say (to Nick), âWeâre getting tetchy and things are really stressed. Itâs no-oneâs fault, itâs just what we are going through and we need to address itï¿½? Luckily Iâm with someone who feels the same.ï¿½?They have relationship coaching with a counsellor through Zoom, which is a brilliant help, she says, as well as their own coping mechanisms. âThere are two human beings involved, thereâs personality and ego. Itâs not a Disney movie, but we are able to sit down and talk about getting really prickly and maybe have a weekend doing our own thing. âOur main problem is over-exposure, which is the same problem so many people had in lockdown, but a lot of people have gone back to work. We donât do that. We work with each other. Itâs finding ways where we can do our own thing,ï¿½?she says. âHe plays golf and goes to the gym. Iâm not interested in golf. I like to pootle, but he finds pootling really irritating.ï¿½?What keeps the marriage fresh? âHe makes me smile. Heâs a really good man. All he wants is for all of us to be happy and I love that so much. In your 50s, your dynamics and what you want changes. You want someone whoâs pretty easy-going. We have fun together and we laugh a lot. âIt is hard when you are starting a business and youâre both entrepreneurs. The key to it all is getting some space and drawing lines in the sand. We also have times when we are not going to talk about work.ï¿½?They moved house to free up equity for the business, and Andrea says: âI felt very sad because it was the house I bought when I got divorced (Andrea has two previous marriages) and it was where Iâd raised my kids. The hardest thing to leave was my garden. Gardening is my happy place. Everyone leaves me alone because no one wants to help. However, Andrea doesnât regret leaving Loose Women. âEven though it seems really hard and challenging, I genuinely love what I do. When I left Loose Women. It was such a weird feeling, because it was all Iâd ever known. From the age of 27, Iâd worked for ITV. I had this box of belongings ï¿½?a cake, some presents and a card. I thought, âThatâs all I have to show for all that timeï¿½? âI felt at peace with it because I was starting a new chapter ï¿½?and Iâve felt like that ever since.ï¿½?She says her breakdown was burnout from taking on too much work, but that she might be lured back to TV if it fitted in with her life coaching career. âIâd love to help people overcome their fears, but not in a quick way. Iâd rather work on something that takes a little time,ï¿½?says Andrea. âItâs never about the quick-fix.ï¿½?You Just Need To Believe It: 10 Ways In 10 Days To Unlock Your Courage And Reclaim Your Power by Andrea McLean is published by Hay House, priced Â£12.99"
517,0,"In Hong Kong, a directive that gnaws",1072 words,The Washington Post,"But when the government announced a cull of 2,000 pet hamsters, a line was crossed. The rodents could carry the coronavirus, officials said, and transmit it to humans. Now, an underground operation is trying to save abandoned hamsters, with foster caregivers taking them in and concealing them. Pet owners are in an uproar over the government's plan to kill the hamsters, which experts say is rooted in knee-jerk panic rather than science. The hamsters are casualties of Hong Kong's ""zero covid"" policy, which many here see as a futile political quest. Resistance groups have assembled on the Telegram messaging app to share updates, drawing on methods used in anti-government protests in 2019. Nearly 3,000 people have volunteered to house the affected hamsters. On social media, concerned residents have shared photos of abandoned hamsters in the hope of enlisting rescuers. Many garnered responses in seconds. The furor erupted when the government said Tuesday that hamsters purchased from pet shops after Dec. 22 were potentially infected with the virus - after several imported from the Netherlands tested positive. Authorities ""strongly recommended"" that pet owners surrender hamsters to their fate. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department has begun to cull small animals from the Little Boss pet store, where the infected hamsters were found after a 23-year-old worker tested positive. The hamsters ""can infect other animals, other hamsters and human beings,"" Thomas Sit, assistant director of the department and a veterinarian, said at a news conference Tuesday. ""We have to protect public health, and we have no choice."" For many pet owners, the response was a resounding ""no."" Alice, 36, said she would never turn in Siu Ding, purchased from Little Boss for her 6-year-old daughter after the cutoff date. She spoke on the condition that only her first name be used, for fear that the authorities could trace the pet. ""Their sins are too deep,"" she said, referring to the government as she held back tears. ""I don't want my hamster killed."" Experts have questioned the merits of the policy. Guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is ""no evidence"" that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus. The City University of Hong Kong's Center for Animal Health and Welfare said the risk of contracting the virus from pets is ""negligible."" The hamsters could be ""innocent bystanders,"" said veterinarian Lawren Durocher-Babek. The government is moving too quickly with the cull, she said, leaving owners struggling to make decisions about the level of risk with no data available. ""There are way too many unknowns to definitively blame hamsters,"" she said. The government has no legal means to force owners to give up their pets, and authorities say there will be no criminal consequences for noncompliance. But some are pushing for stronger action. On Wednesday, lawmaker Michael Tien said a mandate to round up hamsters is necessary as long as there is a risk that they could spread the virus. ""To 'strongly recommend' people to turn in their hamsters is neither fish nor fowl,"" he said. ""There could be drastic consequences."" Hamster supporters are mobilizing in creative ways. One, who is skilled in Photoshop, has offered to amend hamster purchase receipts to indicate the pets were bought before Dec. 22. For some hamsters, it is too late. Convinced by the government or prompted by panic, some families have begun surrendering their furry friends. A boy was seen bawling in a video recorded by local TV channel i-Cable News, saying amid sobs that he didn't want his hamster to go, while taking pictures of their last moments together before his father turned in the doomed animal. At the agriculture department's entrance, a local media outlet interviewed a man who had relinquished his hamster, fearing that the government could trace him to the pet shop via credit card records. Another told reporters that ""the government only wants what's best for citizens."" Volunteers have tried to intercept owners heading to hand over their hamsters, offering to take the animals into their care instead. On Friday, the department warned that if the ""people concerned continue with such action,"" officials would report them to the police. If the authorities come for Siu Ding, Alice said, she will stash the pudding dwarf hamster at a friend's place. ""If, say, horses and dogs are the ones infected, would you decide to kill them all?"" she said. A woman with the last name Yuen, 36, said her mother asked her to dump her hamster, Bao Bao, onto the streets. ""I told my mother, 'I won't throw you out if anything happens to you, as you are my family. Same goes for my hamster; it is my family,' "" she said, withholding her full name out of security concerns. Animal rights groups say the authorities failed to take into account animal-to-human bonds or consider alternative policies, such as testing the hamsters. Poor messaging has led to panic, said Sophia Chan of Life on Palm, a hamster concern group. Chan has been inundated with messages from hamster owners, many of whom face family pressure to abandon their pets. Her apartment has become a safe house for several dozen hamsters she is fostering - not all of them purchased after Dec. 22. The group has received close to 100 abandoned hamsters, Chan said. One woman called in tears after her family threw away her hamster without asking. She rummaged through the trash, but her pet was nowhere to be seen. Despite the outrage, authorities have continued with the hamster slaughter. On Wednesday, officials in full-body protective gear were seen holding medical bags retrieved from pet shops and loading them into vehicles. That same day, 1,213 small animals, including hamsters, rabbits, guinea pigs and chinchillas, were euthanized, according to the agriculture department. shibani.mahtani@washpost.com theodora.yu@washpost.com"

549,1,Public hearings convened to update gas and electricity tariffs,715 words,CE NoticiasFinancieras,"On the other hand, the average correction for most gas users in the country will be 21.5%, with slight variations depending on the regions. The implementation of a tariff scheme for gas and electricity services for the 2022/2023 biennium that, with ""criteria of justice and distributive equity"", includes the segmentation policy and does not exceed the level of salaries is part of the program agreed by the Government with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Today, through resolutions 235, 236 and 237/2022, the portfolio headed by DarÃ­o MartÃ­nez established the call for public hearings that will submit these mechanisms and tariff updates to the users for their consideration. These will especially contemplate the situation of the ""vulnerable sectors and those with lower payment capacity"", within the margins defined therein and which will be governed by the principle of ""gradualness"", as highlighted by the Secretariat of Energy. In this way, the tariff updating process defined by the National Government in the economic program, which aims at achieving ""reasonable tariff levels and susceptible of being applied with criteria of justice and distributive equity"" for gas and electricity public utilities, is initiated. This process will be governed according to criteria and guidelines of ""gradualness and proportionality"" established in the National Constitution and indicated by the Supreme Court of Justice, they pointed out. Thus, the tariff update will be promoted, after a public hearing, with a scheme aimed at ""protecting the most vulnerable sectors and those with lower payment capacity"", and at the same time encouraging the ""adoption of measures that promote the rational use of the services and the reduction of the environmental impact"". For residential users, a ""tariff correction related to the evolution of their income"" will be considered as an objective criterion, represented by the coefficient of salary variation (CVS), as established in Law No. 27,443, which was frustrated by the total veto imposed by the previous administration. For 90% of residential users, this mechanism guarantees that tariff updates will always be lower than salary increases, implying corrections in their bills lower than the increase in income in real terms. The purpose of this criterion is ""to protect real income and improve the distributive aspect of the subsidy policy"", the resolutions state in their recitals. Thus, the tariff scheme for the 2022-2023 biennium contemplates that gas users who are beneficiaries of the social tariff will not have another increase in their bill this year, and for 2023, this correction will be equivalent to 40% of the CVS of the previous year. Meanwhile, for the beneficiaries of the social tariff of the electricity distributors Edenor and Edesur, the new tariff correction for 2022 will not exceed 6%. For the rest of the users, the total increase in the bill for each calendar year will be equivalent to 80% of the Salary Variation Coefficient corresponding to the previous year. Based on this scheme, for 2022 and considering the tariff update made last March, the proposed increase for June will be an average of 17% for electricity tariffs for AMBA users, and an average of 21.5% over the current value of the bill for gas users throughout the country. Finally, the 10% of users with higher income and with full payment capacity will no longer be beneficiaries of energy consumption subsidies. (TÃ©lam)"
426,0,Government spending Â£1.2 million a day housing asylum seekers in hotels,696 words,Evening Standard Online,"Overall, around 25,000 asylum seekers are in hotels, with costs racking up to around Â£1.2 million a day, the Home Affairs Committee[https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/home-affairs-committee] was told.  Home Secretary[https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/home-secretary]  Priti Patel[https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/priti-patel] said there was a challenge in finding homes for thousands of refugees who were still in hotels, months after they were evacuated from Afghanistan. She told MPs: âWe are absolutely struggling with local authorities finding housing accommodation, also we want to make sure that we can move people into work and employment. We want them to rebuild their lives here. âSo there is actually ï¿½?a cross-government task force, we have a minister for resettlement that leads on this, but we are desperately still trying to pull together different component parts.ï¿½?It comes as Conservative MP Tim Loughton[https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/tim-loughton] told Ms Patel that one Afghan refugee in his constituency with young children was in a hotel with âappalling foodï¿½?and âterrible conditionsï¿½? He said he was called a troublemaker and told to shut up and leave when he complained. Ms Patel asked him to provide her with more details, adding that it was an âawful situationï¿½? We're incredibly grateful to the 300 councils that have already stepped forward to help us, but we can always do with more Home Office official Tricia Hayes Home Office official Tricia Hayes said homes had been found for 4,000 Afghan refugees so far and 12,000 remained in âbridging accommodationï¿½? The second permanent secretary was told that some local authorities had reported offering accommodation, only for the Home Office to take months to take them up on their offer. She said that was not what they thought was happening, but that sometimes the type of housing being offered might not be appropriate for a particular family. There were now improved communication systems, such as a dedicated portal to connect people who could offer accommodation with councils and the Government to help match them with families, she said. She added: âWeâre incredibly grateful to the 300 councils that have already stepped forward to help us, but we can always do with more. âSo itâs a good opportunity just to have a call to arms to councils around the country to engage in the new communication and engagement tools that weâve created and make places available.ï¿½?This is a thoroughly inadequate policy, it is not something that we want, and this is part of the reason why there is a lot of wider work taking place on asylum accommodation Home Secretary Priti Patel  Ms Hayes also said there was work under way to improve how the Government worked with councils on housing asylum seekers more generally. She said: âWe have been doing a lot of work recently with the Local Government Association and with other councils to see how we can develop a new way of working with local authorities for asylum schemes, which recognises, as the Home Secretary said, the absolutely financial as well as policy imperative of cutting the cost that weâre currently incurring in hotels, which is now racking up to about Â£1.2 million every single day. âSo weâre optimistic that weâre going to be able to broker a new way of working with local government on how we manage these costs.ï¿½?Ms Patel added: âThis is a thoroughly inadequate policy, it is not something that we want, and this is part of the reason why there is a lot of wider work taking place on asylum accommodation. âWe do not want people in hotels, we are looking at dispersed accommodation.ï¿½?Read More  Levelling Up White Paper fails to provide a serious plan for decent jobs ï¿½?TUC[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/government-tuc-mayor-london-national-education-union-b980310.html]  Pay attention to our wellbeing or risk headteacher shortage, teachers tell MPs[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/mps-government-labour-london-liberal-democrat-b980303.html]  The Leader podcast: What âlevelling upï¿½?means for London[https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/the-leader-podcast-what-levelling-up-means-for-london-b980296.html]"
